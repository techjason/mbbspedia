# Rectal Bleeding — Clinical Approach (Definition through Clinical Features)

## 1. Definition

**Rectal bleeding** (also termed **per-rectal (PR) bleeding** or **haematochezia**) refers to the passage of blood through the anus. It encompasses a spectrum from bright-red blood on toilet paper to massive, haemodynamically significant haemorrhage. Although the term is often used interchangeably with "lower GI bleeding," it is important to understand the distinction:

- ***Lower GI bleeding (LGIB)* = bleeding from the gut distal to the ligament of Treitz** (the duodenojejunal flexure) [1][2][3]. The ligament of Treitz is the anatomical landmark that suspends the duodenojejunal junction — anything proximal is "upper GI," anything distal is "lower GI."
- **Rectal bleeding** is the *presenting symptom*; the *source* may be anywhere from the duodenum (in a massive upper GI bleed) to the anal margin.

> **"Haematochezia"** → Greek: *haima* = blood + *chezein* = to defecate. Literally "bloody defecation."
>
> **"Melaena"** → Greek: *melaina* = black. Tarry black stools from degraded haemoglobin (upper GI source, rarely right colon).

<Callout title="Key Conceptual Point">
Not all rectal bleeding is lower GI bleeding. **10–15% of patients presenting with haematochezia have a massive upper GI source** — the bleeding is so brisk that blood transits the entire bowel before it can be degraded to melaena [2][3]. Always consider upper GI causes in severe haematochezia.
</Callout>

## 2. Epidemiology

- ***Annual incidence of LGIB: approximately 20–27 per 100,000*** [2][3].
- Incidence **increases with age** — most cases occur in the elderly. The median age of presentation is > 60 years [2].
- **In younger adults (< 50 years), haemorrhoids and anal fissures are the most common causes** [1][4].
- ***New bleeding in patients age > 55 years demands colonic investigation*** to exclude malignancy [1].
- **In Hong Kong**, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the **1st most common cancer overall and in males, 2nd most common in females**, with an incidence of ~74.1/100,000/year [5]. This makes excluding CRC a top priority in any patient presenting with PR bleeding in the local context.
- Diverticular disease prevalence increases with age (~60% by age 60), and **in Asian populations, right-sided diverticula predominate** (unlike the left-sided/sigmoid predominance in Western countries) [2][4].

## 3. Anatomy and Function

Understanding the anatomy is essential because it directly determines:
1. The **character** of the bleeding (colour, relationship to stool)
2. The **pain** or lack thereof
3. The **physical examination findings**
4. The **investigation of choice**

### 3.1 Vascular Supply of the Colon and Rectum

The colon receives blood from the **superior mesenteric artery (SMA)** and **inferior mesenteric artery (IMA)**, with the rectum also receiving supply from the **internal iliac artery (IIA)**:

| Segment | Arterial Supply | Key Collateral |
|---|---|---|
| Caecum → transverse colon | SMA (ileocolic, right colic, middle colic aa.) | Marginal artery of Drummond |
| Splenic flexure → sigmoid | IMA (left colic, sigmoid aa.) | Marginal artery of Drummond |
| Rectum (upper) | Superior rectal artery (terminal IMA) | — |
| Rectum (middle/lower) | Middle & inferior rectal aa. (from IIA) | — |

**Watershed areas** — zones between two arterial territories with limited collateral supply — are most vulnerable to ischaemia:

- ***Griffiths' point* (splenic flexure)**: junction of middle colic artery territory (SMA) and ascending left colic artery (IMA) at the marginal artery of Drummond [4][6].
- ***Sudeck's point* (rectosigmoid junction)**: junction of the last sigmoid artery and the superior rectal artery [4][6].

> Why does this matter clinically? **Ischaemic colitis** characteristically affects these watershed areas. A patient presenting with sudden cramping left-sided abdominal pain followed by bloody diarrhoea within 24 hours — think splenic flexure or rectosigmoid ischaemia [6].

### 3.2 Venous Drainage — The Porto-Systemic Connection

| Region | Venous Drainage | System |
|---|---|---|
| Above dentate line | Superior rectal vein → IMV → **portal system** | Portal |
| Below dentate line | Middle & inferior rectal veins → internal iliac vein → **IVC** | Systemic |

This dual drainage explains:
- **Rectal varices** in portal hypertension: the superior rectal veins (portal) communicate with the middle/inferior rectal veins (systemic). When portal pressure rises, these porto-systemic anastomoses dilate → varices → potentially severe bleeding [2][3][4].
- **Haemorrhoids** are NOT varices — they are dilated **anal vascular cushions** (submucosal arteriovenous plexuses), though portal hypertension can worsen them.

### 3.3 Anatomy of the Anal Canal

The anal canal is approximately **4 cm long** from the anal verge. The **dentate (pectinate) line** divides the upper two-thirds from the lower one-third and is a crucial landmark [4]:

| Feature | Above Dentate Line | Below Dentate Line |
|---|---|---|
| **Embryology** | Endoderm | Ectoderm |
| **Epithelium** | Columnar (→ adenocarcinoma) | Stratified squamous (→ SCC) |
| **Nerve supply** | Autonomic (inferior hypogastric plexus) — **visceral, poorly localised sensation** | Somatic (inferior rectal nerve ← pudendal nerve) — **sharp, well-localised pain** |
| **Venous drainage** | Superior rectal vein → portal system | Middle/inferior rectal veins → IVC |
| **Lymphatic drainage** | Internal iliac & inferior mesenteric LNs | **Superficial inguinal LNs** |

<Callout title="Clinical Relevance of the Dentate Line" type="idea">
- **Internal haemorrhoids** (above dentate line) = **painless** bleeding, because they are innervated by autonomic nerves that do not carry somatic pain fibres.
- **External haemorrhoids / thrombosed haemorrhoids** (below dentate line) = **very painful**, because somatic nerves (inferior rectal nerve) provide exquisite pain sensation.
- **Anal fissures** typically occur **below** the dentate line → tearing pain on defecation.
- The lymphatic drainage dictates metastatic patterns: anal SCC below the dentate line → **inguinal lymph nodes** (palpable on examination!).
</Callout>

### 3.4 Anal Vascular Cushions

Normal anal cushions are clusters of:
- Branches of the **superior rectal artery**
- **Superior rectal veins** (forming an arteriovenous plexus)
- Smooth muscle and connective tissue covered by mucosa

They sit at the **3, 7, and 11 o'clock positions** (in lithotomy position) and contribute to **fine continence** (~15% of resting anal tone) by forming a soft, compressible seal [4][7].

### 3.5 Diverticular Anatomy

- Colonic diverticula are **false (pseudo-) diverticula**: only mucosa and submucosa herniate through the muscularis propria [4][8].
- They form at points of **weakness** where the **vasa recta penetrate the circular muscle layer** [4][8].
- The **sigmoid colon** has the narrowest lumen → by **Laplace's law** (Wall tension = Pressure × Radius / Wall thickness), for a given contractile force, the narrowest segment generates the highest intraluminal pressure → most common site in Western populations [8].
- ***In Asia, right-sided diverticula predominate*** — and the right colon has a thinner wall, making diverticular bleeding more common on the right [2][4][8].
- ***The rectum is never affected*** because its outer longitudinal smooth muscle layer encompasses the full circumference (unlike the colon, which has three taeniae coli with gaps between them) [8].

## 4. Etiology (Focused on Hong Kong Context)

### 4.1 Overview of Causes by Anatomical Location

***The following classification by anatomical source is fundamental*** [2][3]:

| Source | Causes | Approximate % of LGIB |
|---|---|---|
| **Massive Upper GI** (< 10%) | Peptic ulcer, variceal bleed | < 10% |
| **Large Bowel** (vast majority) | *Diverticular disease** (17–40%), **Angiodysplasia** (2–30%), **Colitis** (9–11%), **Neoplasm** (7–33%) | ~80–85% |
| **Small Bowel** (~5%) | Meckel's diverticulum, angiodysplasia, small bowel tumours, NSAID-induced ulcers, Crohn's/TB enteritis, aortoenteric fistula | ~5% |
| **Anorectal** (~10%) | Haemorrhoids, fissure-in-ano, anal/rectal ulcers, rectal varices | ~10% |

*\* Causes marked with asterisk can present with heavy, life-threatening bleeding* [2][3].

### 4.2 ***Probability Diagnosis*** (from Murtagh's) [1]

These are the most common causes you should consider first:

1. ***Haemorrhoids / perianal haematoma***
2. ***Anal fissure***
3. ***Colorectal polyp***
4. ***Diverticulitis*** (though note: diverticular *bleeding* and diverticulitis rarely coexist)
5. ***Excoriated skin (anal pruritus)***

### 4.3 ***Serious Disorders Not To Be Missed*** [1]

| Category | Conditions |
|---|---|
| ***Vascular*** | ***Ischaemic colitis, angiodysplasia (vascular ectasia), anticoagulant therapy*** |
| ***Infection*** | ***Enteritis (e.g. Campylobacter, Salmonella)*** |
| ***Cancer/Tumours*** | ***Colorectal cancer, caecal cancer, lymphoma, villous adenoma*** |
| ***Other*** | ***Inflammatory bowel disease (colitis/proctitis), intussusception*** |

### 4.4 ***Pitfalls (Often Missed)*** [1]

- ***Rectal prolapse***
- ***Anal trauma (accidental / non-accidental)***
- ***Villous adenoma***

### 4.5 ***Rarities*** [1]

- ***Meckel diverticulum***
- ***Solitary ulcer of rectum***

<Callout title="Exam Tip — Murtagh's Framework" type="idea">
Murtagh's diagnostic strategy is a favourite framework in HKUMed exams. Be able to recall the probability diagnosis, serious disorders not to be missed, pitfalls, and rarities for rectal bleeding. It structures your differential neatly.

## 5. Detailed Etiology with Pathophysiology

### 5.1 Diverticular Bleeding

> ***Most common cause of LGIB (17–40%)*** [2][3][5].
> ***60% of patients have diverticulosis by age 60, of whom ~17% will bleed*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:**
- As diverticula form, the **vasa recta** (small arteries that normally penetrate the bowel wall to supply the mucosa) become **draped over the dome** of the diverticulum [2][4].
- These arteries are separated from the bowel lumen by only a thin layer of mucosa (no muscularis propria protection).
- Over time, the arterial wall weakens (asymmetric thinning of the media and intimal thickening from chronic mechanical injury).
- **Rupture of the vasa recta into the diverticulum** → **arterial bleeding** → painless, often profuse haematochezia [2][3][4].
- ***Diverticular bleeding typically occurs in the ABSENCE of diverticulitis*** — the two conditions rarely coexist [2][4][5]. This is a common exam pitfall.

**Key Features:**
- ***Painless haematochezia of variable severity*** — can be massive [2][3]
- ***Stops spontaneously in 80–85%*** but ***14–38% rebleeding rate*** [3]
- **Right-sided bleeding** more common (even though in Western populations diverticula are mostly left-sided — the right colon wall is thinner) [2][3]
- ***In Asia: right-sided diverticula are more common anyway***, making right-sided diverticular bleeding even more relevant in Hong Kong [4][8]

**Risk Factors:** Advanced age, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, IHD, chronic renal insufficiency, ***NSAIDs***, aspirin [2][4].

### 5.2 Angiodysplasia (Vascular Ectasia)

> ***Most common cause of LGIB in age > 65*** [2][4].

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Acquired degenerative condition**: repeated peristaltic contraction → intermittent obstruction of submucosal veins as they pass through the muscularis propria → chronic venous congestion → loss of pre-capillary sphincter competence → formation of small **arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)** [4][8].
- The walls are composed of thin endothelial cells **lacking smooth muscle** → fragile and prone to bleeding [2].
- Most common site: **caecum and ascending colon** (right-sided) [2][3][4].
- **Bleeding is venous in origin** → tends to be ***less massive than diverticular bleeding*** but more **intermittent** and **recurrent** [2][3].

**Associations:**
- ***Heyde syndrome***: association with **aortic stenosis** — the shear stress through a stenotic valve causes acquired **von Willebrand factor (vWF) type 2A deficiency** (large vWF multimers are cleaved by ADAMTS13 under high shear) → bleeding tendency from angiodysplastic lesions [3][4][8].
- ***Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia / HHT)***: autosomal dominant condition with widespread vascular malformations [3][4].
- ESRD (end-stage renal disease) — platelet dysfunction from uraemia [4][8].

**Key Features:**
- ***Painless haematochezia***, variable severity, mostly **self-limiting (85–90%)** but **rebleeds in 25–85%** [3]
- May present as **occult GI bleeding** with iron deficiency anaemia and FOBT-positive stools [2]
- Colonoscopy: ***"cherry red spots"*** [8]
- Angiography: ***"mother-in-law phenomenon"*** (early filling, delayed emptying of contrast — it comes early and stays late!) [8]

### 5.3 Haemorrhoids

> ***Most common cause of PR bleeding in age < 50*** [2][4].
> ***Very common — 4.4% prevalence in general population*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Degeneration of supporting fibroelastic tissues and smooth muscles** with age and chronic straining → anal cushions displaced caudally → **dilatation and engorgement of the arteriovenous plexuses** → **prolapse** [7][8].
- This is NOT primarily a "varicose vein" phenomenon — it is a **sliding anal cushion** problem with loss of tissue support.
- May acutely **thrombose**: the plexus thromboses within the cushion → **painful, large, swollen, irreducible mass** with marked sphincter spasm [7][8].

**Risk Factors:** Aging, prolonged sitting on toilet, increased intra-abdominal pressure (constipation, chronic cough, ascites, pregnancy), genetic predisposition, low-fibre diet, obesity [2][4][7].

**Classification of Internal Haemorrhoids** [4]:

| Grade | Description |
|---|---|
| **1st degree** | Bleeding only, no prolapse |
| **2nd degree** | Prolapse on defecation, **reduces spontaneously** |
| **3rd degree** | Prolapse, requires **manual reduction** |
| **4th degree** | **Permanently prolapsed**, cannot be reduced |

**Key Features:**
- **Internal haemorrhoids**: ***painless bright-red outlet-type bleeding*** (blood coating stool, dripping into toilet bowl, or on toilet paper after defecation) — painless because above the dentate line (autonomic innervation) [3][4][7].
- **External haemorrhoids**: pain after defecation → ***severe perianal pain if thrombosed*** (somatic innervation below dentate line) [7].
- May have: prolapse, anal itching (mucus secretion irritating perianal skin), mucous discharge [3][4][7].

<Callout title="Critical Clinical Point" type="error">
***ALWAYS exclude other possible sources of PR bleeding*** when haemorrhoids are found [4]. Haemorrhoids are so common that they can be an **incidental finding** — you must still exclude colorectal cancer, especially in patients > 45 years with change in bowel habit or family history [7].
</Callout>

### 5.4 Anal Fissure

**Definition:** A **tear in the anoderm distal to the dentate line** [4].

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Passage of hard stool** or other local trauma → stretching of anal mucosa beyond its capacity → tear in the anoderm [4].
- The tear exposes the **internal anal sphincter** beneath → **reflex spasm** of the internal sphincter → this **pulls the edges of the fissure apart** and impairs healing [4].
- Additionally, the **posterior midline of the anal canal has the poorest blood supply** (the inferior rectal artery branches supply this area last) → **ischaemia** further impairs healing [4].
- This creates a **vicious cycle**: fissure → spasm → ischaemia → impaired healing → chronic fissure [4].

> ***90% occur in the posterior midline*** — because that's where the blood supply is worst. If you see a fissure that is lateral, off-midline, multiple, or painless, think of **secondary causes**: Crohn's disease, TB, syphilis, HIV, anal cancer [4].

**Key Features:**
- ***Tearing pain with passage of bowel movements*** — the hallmark. Patients describe it as "passing broken glass." The pain may persist for hours after defecation (due to sustained sphincter spasm) [4].
- ***Bright rectal bleeding — limited to a small amount on toilet paper or surface of stool*** [4].
- Perianal pruritus or skin irritation [4].
- Acute fissures typically heal within **6 weeks**; chronic fissures develop a sentinel skin tag (externally) and hypertrophied anal papilla (internally) — the classic triad of **chronic anal fissure** [4].

### 5.5 Colorectal Cancer (CRC)

> ***~10% of PR bleeding in patients > 50 years*** [3]. ***In Hong Kong, CRC is the most common cancer by incidence*** [5].

**Pathophysiology:**
- Bleeding occurs due to **overlying erosion or ulceration** of the tumour surface [2][3].
- The tumour outgrows its blood supply → surface necrosis → chronic, low-grade oozing → often presents as **iron deficiency anaemia** or **FOBT-positive** rather than overt haematochezia [3].
- **Right-sided tumours** (caecum, ascending colon): more likely to present with **occult bleeding and anaemia** (blood is degraded during transit → may not be visibly red).
- **Left-sided tumours** (descending, sigmoid): more likely to present with **visible PR bleeding**, **change in bowel habit**, and **obstructive symptoms** (the lumen is narrower on the left).
- **Rectal tumours**: **tenesmus** (sensation of incomplete evacuation due to the mass occupying the rectal vault), PR bleeding mixed with mucus, and ***80% are within fingertip range on digital rectal examination*** [1].

**Key Features** (the "red flag" constellation) [1][3][5]:
- ***Change in bowel habits: alternating diarrhoea and constipation***
- ***Change in stool calibre (pencil-thin stools)*** — from luminal narrowing
- ***Tenesmus*** — mass in rectum mimics sensation of residual stool
- ***Constitutional symptoms: weight loss, loss of appetite, malaise***
- ***Passage of mucus*** — especially with villous adenomas (can cause **secretory diarrhoea** and even hypokalaemia)
- **Metastatic symptoms**: jaundice (liver), bone pain, SOB (lungs), ascites (peritoneal)

**Risk Factors** [5]:
- Age > 50, male, family history, personal history of polyps or CRC
- IBD (UC > CD) — risk increases after 8–10 years of pancolitis
- Polyposis syndromes: FAP, HNPCC (Lynch syndrome)
- Diet: red/processed meat, high fat, low fibre
- Lifestyle: obesity, DM, smoking, alcohol, physical inactivity
- Drugs: ***NSAIDs and aspirin are protective***; androgen deprivation therapy increases risk

### 5.6 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

**Ulcerative Colitis (UC):**
- ***Bloody diarrhoea*** (mucoid loose stools) is the hallmark — because the inflammation is **mucosal and continuous**, starting from the rectum and extending proximally → friable, bleeding mucosa [4][9].
- ***Bleeding more commonly associated with UC than Crohn's disease*** [3].
- Extra-intestinal manifestations: arthritis, episcleritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, primary sclerosing cholangitis [3].
- **Protective factors for UC**: prior appendicectomy, smoking (paradoxically) [9].

**Crohn's Disease (CD):**
- **Transmural, skip-lesion** pattern → deep ulcers, fistulae, abscesses.
- PR bleeding can occur but is less prominent than in UC.
- Right ileal/ileocaecal disease is most common → may present with RLQ pain and occult bleeding.

### 5.7 Ischaemic Colitis

> ***Most common form (> 50%) of ischaemic GI injury*** [6].
> ***90% occur in patients > 60 years*** [6].

**Pathophysiology:**
- **Non-occlusive (95%)**: transient systemic low-flow states (hypotension, cardiac failure, post-cardiac surgery, vasopressors) → preferentially affects watershed areas [6].
- **Occlusive (5%)**: arterial embolism (AF, valvular disease) or thrombosis (atherosclerosis) or rarely venous thrombosis [4][6].
- ***The colon receives less blood flow than the rest of the GIT*** and is therefore most vulnerable to ischaemia [6].
- Damage is largely mediated by **reperfusion injury** (transmural necrosis only in 15% when ischaemia is prolonged) [6].

**Key Features:**
- ***Sudden onset cramping abdominal pain*** (milder and more lateral than mesenteric ischaemia) [6]
- ***Mild-to-moderate rectal bleeding develops ≤ 24 hours after onset of abdominal pain*** — fresh or dark, more common with left colonic ischaemia [6]
- ***Urgency to defecate*** [6]
- ***Clinical triad: abdominal pain + bloody diarrhoea + cardiovascular risk factors*** [6]
- Labs: ↑↑WCC, metabolic acidosis, ↑lactate, ↑LDH, ↑CPK [6]

**Risk Factors** [6]: AF, heart failure, atherosclerosis, recent MI, aortic surgery, vasopressors, cocaine, hypercoagulable states, dialysis.

### 5.8 Infective Colitis

Infectious causes include ***Campylobacter, Salmonella*** [1], *C. difficile* (especially post-antibiotic), CMV (in immunosuppressed), amoebic dysentery, and TB [2][3].

**Key Features:**
- Fever, diarrhoea (bloody or watery), abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting
- **Travel history, food history, contact history, immunosuppression status** are key
- **C. difficile**: recent antibiotic use → toxin-mediated mucosal injury → pseudomembranous colitis
- **CMV colitis**: in immunosuppressed (HIV, transplant) → deep colonic ulcers, can cause massive bleeding

### 5.9 Radiation Proctocolitis

**Pathophysiology:**
- Radiation therapy for pelvic malignancies (cervical, prostate, bladder) → **epithelial atrophy and fibrosis** with **obliterative endarteritis** → chronic mucosal ischaemia → fragile telangiectatic vessels that bleed [3][4].
- ***Acute: < 6 weeks after therapy***; ***Chronic/delayed: > 9 months but can be > 10 years*** [3].

**Key Features:** Diarrhoea, rectal urgency/tenesmus, PR bleeding [3].

### 5.10 Rectal Varices

- Due to **portal hypertension**: portosystemic shunt between superior rectal veins (portal) and middle/inferior rectal veins (systemic) [2][3].
- ***Often presents with severe bleeding*** [3].
- Distinct from haemorrhoids — rectal varices are proximal in the rectum and directly related to portal hypertension.

### 5.11 Other Anorectal Causes

**Anal Fistula:**
- ***Cryptoglandular hypothesis (90%)***: obstruction of anal gland ducts → infection → abscess → discharge along path of least resistance → fistula tract [7].
- Presents with intermittent perianal discharge + pain; palpable cord-like tract [7].

**Rectal Prolapse:**
- Protrusion of rectal wall through the anus (complete = full thickness; partial = mucosa only) [4].
- Bleeding from mucosal trauma and congestion.
- Affects mainly elderly women; associated with chronic straining, multiparity, pelvic floor dysfunction [4].

**Solitary Rectal Ulcer:**
- Associated with straining and rectal prolapse (internal intussusception).
- ***A rarity but a known pitfall*** [1].

**Anal Carcinoma:**
- ***80% SCC (below dentate line)*** [7].
- Risk factors: ***HPV infection (90%, especially HPV-16 and 18)***, HIV, smoking, immunosuppression, Crohn's disease [7].
- ***Painful PR bleeding***, palpable mass, inguinal lymphadenopathy (if below dentate line) [7].

### 5.12 Meckel's Diverticulum

> ***A rarity*** [1] but important in **young patients** with unexplained LGIB.

- **Rule of 2s**: 2% of population, 2 feet from ileocaecal valve, 2 inches long, 2 types of ectopic tissue (gastric and pancreatic), symptomatic before age 2.
- Contains **ectopic gastric mucosa** → acid secretion → ulceration of adjacent ileal mucosa → **painless massive PR bleeding** (often dark/maroon as it originates from the small bowel).
- **True diverticulum** (all layers of bowel wall) unlike colonic diverticula.
- Diagnosis: **Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan** (Meckel's scan) — the radiotracer is taken up by ectopic gastric mucosa.

## 6. Classification of Rectal Bleeding

Rectal bleeding can be classified in several clinically useful ways:

### 6.1 By Acuity

| Category | Definition | Common Causes |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute overt** | Visible blood, recent onset ± haemodynamic compromise | Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, massive UGIB |
| **Chronic overt** | Visible blood over days to weeks | Haemorrhoids, CRC, IBD, fissure |
| **Occult** | FOBT-positive or iron deficiency anaemia without visible blood | CRC, angiodysplasia, small bowel lesions |

### 6.2 By Character of Blood

| Character | Likely Source | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bright red blood on toilet paper / coating stool*** | Anorectal (haemorrhoids, fissure) | Outlet-type: blood is fresh because it originates distal to the rectum and has no time for degradation |
| ***Bright red blood mixed with stool*** | Left colon (sigmoid, descending) | Short transit time from left colon → minimal degradation |
| ***Dark or maroon blood mixed with stool*** | Right colon | Longer transit time → partial degradation of haemoglobin |
| ***Blood by itself (torrential)*** | Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, rectal varices | Brisk arterial/venous bleeding overwhelming normal stool formation |
| ***Melaena (black, tarry)*** | Upper GI (above ligament of Treitz) | Haemoglobin degraded by gastric acid and intestinal bacteria → haematin (black) |
| ***Blood + mucus*** | Rectal tumour, IBD (proctitis), villous adenoma | Mucus secretion from inflamed or neoplastic mucosa |
| ***Cyclic PR bleeding*** | GI endometriosis | Ectopic endometrial tissue bleeds with menstrual cycle |

### 6.3 By Severity

| Severity | Features |
|---|---|
| **Minor** | Small volume, no haemodynamic compromise, likely anorectal source |
| **Major** | > 150 mL blood loss, haemodynamic instability, requires resuscitation |
| **Massive** | Ongoing transfusion requirement, haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation |

---

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms — with Pathophysiological Basis

#### A. The Bleeding Itself

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Bright red blood on toilet paper or dripping after defecation*** | Outlet-type bleeding from haemorrhoids or fissures — blood is deposited on the surface of stool or drips after passage because the source is at or very near the anal verge [3][7] |
| ***Blood coating the surface of stool*** | Source in the anus or rectum — stool is formed before it reaches the bleeding point, so blood is applied externally [3] |
| ***Blood mixed with faeces*** | Source **above the sigmoid colon** — blood has time to mix with stool during transit [3][8] |
| ***Dark/maroon coloured blood*** | Right-sided colonic source — longer transit allows bacterial degradation of haemoglobin → darker colour [2][3] |
| ***Profuse, painless haematochezia (blood by itself)*** | Torrential bleeding from **diverticular disease or angiodysplasia** — rate of bleeding overwhelms stool, blood passes on its own [3] |
| ***Bloody diarrhoea (blood + mucus + frequent loose stools)*** | **Colitis** (IBD, infective, ischaemic) — mucosal inflammation → increased secretion, impaired absorption, and mucosal friability causing bleeding [3] |
| ***Passage of mucus with blood*** | ***Suggests rectal tumour or proctitis*** [1] — villous adenomas secrete large volumes of mucus; rectal cancers may have overlying mucus from goblet cell activity |
| ***Melaena*** | Upper GI source (or rarely right colon) — haemoglobin converted to acid haematin by gastric acid (black) + bacterial degradation → tarry, foul-smelling stool |

#### B. Associated Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis | Suggests |
|---|---|---|
| **Pain on defecation (tearing/sharp)** | Fissure → tear in somatic-innervated anoderm below dentate line → sharp pain; internal sphincter spasm sustains it [4] | Anal fissure |
| **Painless bleeding** | Internal haemorrhoids (autonomic innervation above dentate line) or diverticular bleeding (no peritoneal inflammation) [2][4] | Haemorrhoids, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia |
| ***Severe perianal pain (unrelated to defecation)*** | Thrombosed external haemorrhoid → acute distension of somatic-innervated tissue, or perianal abscess → infection in perianal space [7] | Thrombosed haemorrhoid, perianal abscess |
| **Cramping abdominal pain → then PR bleeding within 24h** | Ischaemic colitis — mucosal ischaemia → pain, then reperfusion → mucosal sloughing and bleeding [6] | Ischaemic colitis |
| ***Alternating diarrhoea and constipation*** | Partial colonic obstruction by tumour → stool backs up (constipation) → bacterial liquefaction → overflow diarrhoea [5] | **CRC** |
| ***Tenesmus*** | Rectal mass stimulates stretch receptors → constant sensation of needing to defecate despite empty rectum [5][8] | Rectal cancer, proctitis |
| ***Pencil-thin stools*** | Tumour narrowing the rectal/sigmoid lumen → stool is compressed as it passes [5] | CRC |
| **Weight loss, anorexia, malaise** | Tumour metabolic demand + chronic bleeding → cancer cachexia and iron deficiency [5] | CRC, lymphoma |
| ***Urgency to defecate*** | Rectal inflammation (proctitis, UC, radiation) → reduced rectal compliance → smaller volumes trigger the urge to defecate [3][6] | IBD, radiation proctitis, ischaemic colitis |
| **Fever, rigors, night sweats** | Systemic inflammatory response to infection [3] | Infective colitis |
| **Jaundice, bone pain, dyspnoea** | Metastatic spread: liver → jaundice, bone → pain, lung → dyspnoea [3][5] | Advanced CRC |
| **Dizziness, syncope, palpitations, SOB on exertion** | Anaemic symptoms — chronic blood loss → iron deficiency → reduced oxygen-carrying capacity → compensatory tachycardia [3] | Any chronic bleeding source |

#### C. Symptoms by Specific Cause — A Quick-Reference Table

| Cause | Classic Symptom Pattern |
|---|---|
| **Haemorrhoids** | Painless bright red outlet-type bleeding, prolapsing mass, pruritus |
| **Anal fissure** | Tearing pain on defecation, small amount of bright blood on paper, constipation history |
| **Diverticular bleeding** | ***Painless, usually profuse haematochezia*** (not chronic), few abdominal symptoms |
| **Angiodysplasia** | Painless, less severe than diverticular, intermittent, elderly |
| **CRC** | Change in bowel habit, constitutional symptoms, low-grade intermittent bleeding, iron deficiency |
| **UC** | Bloody diarrhoea with mucus, urgency, tenesmus, extra-intestinal manifestations |
| **Ischaemic colitis** | Sudden crampy abdominal pain → PR bleeding within 24h, CVS risk factors |
| **Infective colitis** | Fever, diarrhoea ± blood, TOCC, recent antibiotics (C. diff) |
| **Radiation proctitis** | History of pelvic radiotherapy, tenesmus, PR bleeding (may be delayed years) |

### 7.2 Signs — with Pathophysiological Basis

#### A. General Examination

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Pallor (conjunctival, palmar)*** | Chronic blood loss → iron deficiency anaemia → reduced haemoglobin → pallor [1][3] | Suggests chronic/occult bleeding |
| **Tachycardia, hypotension** | Acute volume depletion → baroreceptor-mediated sympathetic activation → ↑HR; insufficient preload → ↓BP | Haemodynamic compromise — acute significant bleed |
| **Postural hypotension** | ≥ 20 mmHg systolic drop on standing → indicates ≥ 15% blood volume loss | Early sign of hypovolaemia |
| **Koilonychia (spoon nails)** | Chronic iron deficiency → impaired nail bed keratinisation | Chronic occult blood loss (CRC, angiodysplasia) |
| **Angular cheilitis, glossitis** | Iron deficiency → impaired epithelial cell turnover | Chronic bleeding |
| **Cachexia, temporal wasting** | Malignancy → increased catabolic cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) → muscle wasting | Advanced CRC |
| **Lymphadenopathy** (left supraclavicular = Virchow's node, or inguinal) | Lymphatic spread of tumour: Virchow's node ← thoracic duct ← abdominal malignancy; inguinal ← anal cancer below dentate line | Metastatic CRC or anal cancer [7] |
| **Jaundice, hepatomegaly** | Liver metastases from CRC → biliary obstruction or replacement of hepatocytes | Metastatic CRC |
| **Spider naevi, caput medusae, gynaecomastia** | Signs of chronic liver disease → portal hypertension → rectal varices | Portal hypertensive bleeding |
| **Skin lesions** | Erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum (IBD); hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia on lips/fingertips (Osler-Weber-Rendu) | IBD, HHT |

#### B. Abdominal Examination

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Palpable abdominal mass** | Tumour large enough to be palpable through the abdominal wall; right-sided colon tumours often grow larger before causing symptoms (wider lumen) | CRC (especially caecal/ascending) |
| **Tenderness over the left iliac fossa** | Inflammation of sigmoid diverticula → localised peritoneal irritation | Diverticulitis (though diverticular *bleeding* is usually painless) |
| **Tenderness over the splenic flexure or left colon** | Ischaemia of watershed area → mucosal/transmural inflammation | Ischaemic colitis |
| **Distension** | Bowel obstruction from tumour or stricture | CRC, diverticular stricture |
| **Ascites** | Peritoneal carcinomatosis (CRC) or portal hypertension (liver disease) | Advanced CRC, chronic liver disease |
| **Hepatomegaly (hard, nodular, non-tender)** | Liver metastases | Metastatic CRC |
| **Splenomegaly** | Portal hypertension → splenic congestion | Cirrhosis with portal hypertension |

#### C. ***Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) and Anorectal Inspection*** [1][4]

This is **the single most important examination** in the assessment of rectal bleeding. ***80% of rectal tumours are within fingertip range*** [1].

**Inspection:**
- **Perianal skin**: excoriation (pruritus, mucus from haemorrhoids/fistula), skin tags (chronic fissure, Crohn's), condylomata (HPV), scars (prior surgery), sinuses (fistula, pilonidal)
- **Anal fissure**: usually seen at the **posterior midline** (6 o'clock in lithotomy position); sentinel skin tag externally [4]
- **Prolapsed haemorrhoids**: engorged, purple/blue swellings at 3, 7, 11 o'clock
- **Thrombosed external haemorrhoid**: tense, blue, extremely tender perianal lump [7]
- **Rectal prolapse**: circumferential concentric mucosal folds (cf. haemorrhoidal prolapse = radial folds) [4]
- **Fistula external opening**: may discharge pus; palpable cord-like tract towards anal canal [7]

**Palpation (DRE):**
- ***Pain***: anal fissure (may be too painful to examine — do NOT force), perianal abscess, thrombosed haemorrhoid
- ***Induration***: fibrosis, chronic fissure, tumour
- ***Mass***: rectal cancer — hard, irregular, may be fixed. Assess distance from anal verge, size, mobility, circumferential extent [4][7]
- ***Anal tone*** (resting = internal anal sphincter; squeeze = external anal sphincter): reduced tone in rectal prolapse, neurological conditions [4][7]
- ***Blood on gloved finger***: confirms PR bleeding; colour gives clue to source
- **Prostate** (in males) / **rectovaginal septum** (in females) — assess for extraluminal masses [7]

**Proctoscopy:**
- ***Essential for visualising internal haemorrhoids*** — 1st/2nd degree haemorrhoids may not be palpable on DRE [7]
- Allows direct visualisation of the distal anal canal and lower rectum

## 8. Key History Taking Framework for Rectal Bleeding

***Murtagh's Key History*** [1]:
> ***Nature of the bleed: fresh versus altered blood, mixed with faeces and/or mucus, in toilet bowl or on underwear. Quantity of bleeding: slight, moderate or torrential. Associated symptoms (e.g. weight loss, constipation, diarrhoea, pain, weakness, presence of lumps, urgency, unsatisfied defecation, recent change of bowel habit).***

A systematic approach from the senior notes [3][8]:

1. **The bleeding itself:**
   - Presentation: ***acute vs chronic, occult vs overt***
   - Colour: bright red, dark/maroon, melaenic
   - Relationship to stool: ***mixed with (proximal), on surface (distal), on paper only (anorectal), by itself (torrential)***
   - Timing: with defecation (outlet), independent of defecation (colonic)
   - Quantity: spot on paper vs bowl full of blood
   - Previous episodes

2. **Bowel habit:**
   - ***Alternating constipation and diarrhoea, pencil-thin stools, tenesmus*** (CRC red flags) [1][3]
   - Mucus, diarrhoea → colitis or CRC
   - Constipation → fissure risk

3. **Anorectal symptoms:**
   - Pain, pruritus, prolapsing mass → anorectal pathology

4. **Upper GI symptoms:**
   - Haematemesis, coffee ground vomitus, melaena → upper GI bleed

5. **Red flag / malignancy symptoms:**
   - Age > 50, constitutional symptoms, family history, prior polyps/IBD
   - Metastatic symptoms: jaundice, bone pain, SOB, ascites

6. **Complications:**
   - Shock: extreme thirst, confusion, pallor, oliguria
   - Symptomatic anaemia: SOB on exertion, postural dizziness, syncope, chest pain, palpitation [3]

7. **Important history:**
   - Comorbidities: cardiopulmonary disease, HF/RF, liver disease, bleeding disorders
   - ***Drug history: NSAIDs (small bowel ulcers, diverticular bleeding), antiplatelets, anticoagulants*** [3]
   - Travel/food/contact history (infective causes)
   - ***History of abdominal irradiation*** (radiation proctocolitis) [3]
   - Surgical history (prior polypectomy → post-polypectomy bleeding)

## 9. ***Key Examination*** [1]

> ***General inspection (evidence of anaemia) and vital signs***
>
> ***Abnormal examination, anal inspection, digital rectal examination, proctosigmoidoscopy***

---

## 10. ***Key Investigations*** (Overview — details in Dx section) [1]

> ***FBE and ESR***
>
> ***Stool M&C***
>
> ***Faecal occult blood***
>
> ***Colonoscopy***
>
> ***Consider abdominal X-ray, CT colonography, angiography, small bowel enema (depending on clinical findings)***

---

## 11. ***Diagnostic Tips*** (Murtagh's) [1]

> ***1. Black, tarry (melaena) stool indicates bleeding from upper GIT: rare distal to lower ileum.***
>
> ***2. Frequent passage of blood and mucus indicates a rectal tumour or proctitis.***
>
> ***3. If substantial haemorrhage, consider diverticular disease, angiodysplasia or more proximal lesions (e.g. Meckel diverticulum, duodenal ulcers).***
>
> ***4. New bleeding age > 55 years demands colonic investigation.***
>
> ***5. 80% of rectal tumours are within fingertip range.***
>
> ***6. In young adults, diagnosis is likely to be haemorrhoids or a fissure.***

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition:** Rectal bleeding = passage of blood per rectum. LGIB = bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz. 10–15% of haematochezia may be from an upper GI source.

**Most Common Causes by Age:**
- < 50 years: Haemorrhoids, anal fissure
- > 65 years: Diverticular disease (most common overall cause of LGIB), angiodysplasia

**Murtagh's Framework:**
- Probability: Haemorrhoids, fissure, polyp, diverticular disease
- Serious: Ischaemic colitis, angiodysplasia, CRC, IBD, intussusception
- Pitfalls: Rectal prolapse, anal trauma, villous adenoma
- Rarities: Meckel's diverticulum, solitary rectal ulcer

**Character of Blood:**
- On surface/paper = anorectal
- Mixed with stool = above sigmoid
- By itself (torrential) = diverticular disease, angiodysplasia
- Blood + mucus = rectal tumour or proctitis
- Melaena = upper GI

**Key Anatomy:**
- Dentate line: above = painless (autonomic), below = painful (somatic)
- Haemorrhoid positions: 3, 7, 11 o'clock
- Watershed areas: Griffiths' point (splenic flexure), Sudeck's point (rectosigmoid)
- Asian diverticula are predominantly right-sided

**Red Flags for CRC:** Age > 50, change in bowel habit, pencil-thin stools, tenesmus, constitutional symptoms, family history, iron deficiency anaemia.

**DRE is mandatory** — 80% of rectal tumours are within fingertip range. Always exclude other causes even when haemorrhoids are found.

    {
      question: "A 70-year-old man presents with painless, profuse bright red blood per rectum that stopped spontaneously. What is the most likely diagnosis and what is the underlying mechanism of bleeding?",
      markscheme: "Diverticular bleeding. Mechanism: rupture of vasa recta draped over the dome of a diverticulum — the artery is separated from the lumen by only mucosa (no muscularis propria), leading to arterial bleeding into the bowel lumen. Stops spontaneously in 80-85%."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why internal haemorrhoids cause painless bleeding whereas anal fissures cause severe pain on defecation.",
      markscheme: "Internal haemorrhoids are above the dentate line — innervated by autonomic nerves (inferior hypogastric plexus) which do not carry somatic pain. Anal fissures are tears below the dentate line — innervated by somatic nerves (inferior rectal nerve from pudendal nerve) providing sharp, well-localised pain sensation."
    },
    {
      question: "Name the two watershed areas of the colon vulnerable to ischaemic colitis and explain why they are vulnerable.",
      markscheme: "1. Griffiths point (splenic flexure) — junction of SMA and IMA territories at the marginal artery of Drummond. 2. Sudeck point (rectosigmoid junction) — junction of last sigmoid artery and superior rectal artery. These are boundary zones between two arterial territories with limited collateral overlap, so they are vulnerable during low-flow states."
    },
    {
      question: "A 55-year-old presents with PR bleeding. What features in the history would raise concern for colorectal cancer? Name at least 5.",
      markscheme: "Any 5 of: age over 50, change in bowel habit (alternating diarrhoea and constipation), pencil-thin stools, tenesmus, passage of mucus, constitutional symptoms (weight loss, anorexia, malaise), family history of CRC or polyps, personal history of IBD or polyps, iron deficiency anaemia, metastatic symptoms (jaundice, bone pain, dyspnoea)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why are right-sided colonic diverticula more common in Asian populations, and why does this matter clinically?",
      markscheme: "Genetic and dietary factors lead to right-sided predominance in Asia (vs sigmoid in the West). Clinically important because: (1) the right colon wall is thinner, so right-sided diverticula have a higher risk of bleeding; (2) bleeding from the right colon produces darker or maroon-coloured blood that may be confused with an upper GI source; (3) the rectum is never affected because its longitudinal muscle layer is circumferential."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'mother-in-law phenomenon' seen on mesenteric angiography, and what condition does it diagnose?",
      markscheme: "Angiodysplasia. The mother-in-law phenomenon refers to early filling and delayed emptying of contrast in the angiodysplastic lesion on mesenteric angiography — like a mother-in-law, the contrast arrives early and stays late. This occurs because the AVM has direct arteriovenous communication without normal capillary resistance."
