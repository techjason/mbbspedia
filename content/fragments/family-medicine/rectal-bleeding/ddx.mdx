## Differential Diagnosis of Rectal Bleeding

The differential diagnosis of rectal bleeding is one of the most commonly examined topics in clinical medicine. The key challenge is that the symptom — blood per rectum — is shared by conditions ranging from the trivially benign (a small haemorrhoidal bleed) to the immediately life-threatening (massive diverticular haemorrhage) to the insidiously fatal (colorectal carcinoma). Your job is to **risk-stratify** and **pattern-recognise** using the character of bleeding, associated symptoms, patient demographics, and examination findings.

### 1. Organising Framework — Murtagh's Diagnostic Strategy

This is the framework you should have at your fingertips. It forces you to think beyond the "probable" and actively consider what you must not miss.

| Category | Conditions |
|---|---|
| ***Probability diagnosis*** | ***Haemorrhoids / perianal haematoma***, ***anal fissure***, ***colorectal polyp***, ***diverticulitis*** (note: diverticular *bleeding* is the more relevant entity for PR bleed), ***excoriated skin (anal pruritus)*** [1] |
| ***Serious disorders not to be missed*** | **Vascular:** ***ischaemic colitis, angiodysplasia (vascular ectasia), anticoagulant therapy*** · **Infection:** ***enteritis (e.g. Campylobacter, Salmonella)*** · **Cancer/Tumours:** ***colorectal, caecum, lymphoma, villous adenoma*** · **Other:** ***inflammatory bowel disease (colitis/proctitis), intussusception*** [1] |
| ***Pitfalls (often missed)*** | ***Rectal prolapse***, ***anal trauma (accidental / non-accidental)***, ***villous adenoma*** [1] |
| ***Rarities*** | ***Meckel diverticulum***, ***solitary ulcer of rectum*** [1] |

<Callout title="Why Murtagh's Framework Matters">
This four-tier system ensures you don't anchor on a benign diagnosis. Haemorrhoids are extremely common and will be present coincidentally in many patients — but calling everything "haemorrhoids" is how colorectal cancers get missed. The framework forces you to actively exclude the serious conditions before settling on the probable.

### 2. Differential Diagnosis by Anatomical Source

Thinking anatomically helps you localise the bleed and choose the right investigation. ***LGIB is defined as bleeding distal to the ligament of Treitz*** [2][3], but remember that ***10–15% of haematochezia originates from an upper GI source*** — never forget to consider this, especially in massive bleeds [3][5].

| Anatomical Source | Cause | Approximate % of LGIB | Key Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Massive Upper GI** | ***Peptic ulcer, variceal bleed*** [3] | < 10% | Brisk bleeding overwhelms GI transit → blood not degraded → presents as haematochezia rather than melaena |
| **Large Bowel** | ***Diverticular disease (17–40%)*** | — | Rupture of vasa recta draped over diverticulum dome (arterial bleeding) [2][3][5] |
| | ***Angiodysplasia (2–30%)*** | — | Degenerative submucosal AVMs; venous bleeding, less massive but recurrent [2][3] |
| | ***Colitis (9–11%)***: infective (*C. difficile*, CMV, amoebic, TB), inflammatory (UC, CD), ***ischaemic***, radiation [3] | — | Mucosal inflammation/ischaemia → friable mucosa → bleeding |
| | ***Neoplasm (7–33%)***: carcinoma, large polyps, post-polypectomy [3] | — | Overlying erosion/ulceration of tumour surface [3][5] |
| **Small Bowel** (~5%) | ***Meckel's diverticulum***, jejunoileal diverticula, angiodysplasia, small bowel tumours, ***NSAID-induced ulcers***, Crohn's/TB enteritis, ***aortoenteric fistula*** [3] | ~5% | Meckel's: ectopic gastric mucosa → acid secretion → ileal ulceration; aortoenteric fistula: graft erosion into duodenum (herald bleed → massive exsanguination) |
| **Anorectal** (~10%) | ***Haemorrhoids, fissure-in-ano***, anal/rectal ulcers, ***rectal varices*** [3] | ~10% | Haemorrhoids: engorgement of anal cushion AV plexus; fissure: mucosal tear below dentate line; rectal varices: portosystemic collateral dilatation |

### 3. Detailed Differential Diagnosis — Distinguishing Features

The exam often asks you to differentiate between causes. Here is a systematic comparison table that maps each differential to its **characteristic bleeding pattern**, **associated features**, and **key distinguishing points**.

#### 3.1 Causes Differentiated by History

| ***Aetiology*** | ***Bleeding Pattern*** | ***Key Distinguishing Features*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***UGI bleed*** | ***Melaena, haematemesis, coffee ground vomitus. Should be considered especially in severe haematochezia (10–15% from UGI)*** [3][5] | History of peptic ulcer disease, NSAID use, liver disease. Haemodynamic instability disproportionate to volume of PR blood |
| ***Diverticular disease*** | ***Painless, usually profuse haematochezia (not chronic)*** [3][5] | Acute onset, self-limiting (80–85%), few abdominal symptoms. **Diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding rarely coexist** [2][5]. In Asia: right-sided predominance [2] |
| ***Angiodysplasia*** | ***Painless, less severe than diverticular but tends to be intermittent*** [3][5] | ***Usually in elderly, may be associated with vascular malformations (e.g. HHT) and aortic stenosis*** [3][5]. Recurrent episodes. May present as occult bleeding with iron deficiency anaemia |
| ***Colorectal carcinoma*** | Low-grade, intermittent bleeding; often FOBT+ or IDA [3][5] | ***> 50y, male, smoker, FHx, Hx of IBD, polyps and colorectal CA. Alternating diarrhoea and constipation, pencil-thin stools, tenesmus. Loss of appetite, loss of weight, malaise. Intractable pain, jaundice/RUQ discomfort, dyspnoea, bone pain*** [3][5][8] |
| ***Colitis — Inflammatory (IBD)*** | ***Usually bloody diarrhoea. Extra-intestinal manifestations: arthritis, episcleritis/uveitis, erythema nodosum*** [3][5] | UC: continuous mucosal inflammation from rectum → bloody mucoid diarrhoea, urgency, tenesmus. CD: skip lesions, perianal disease, fistulae. ***Bleeding more commonly associated with UC than Crohn's*** [3] |
| ***Colitis — Ischaemic*** | Mild-to-moderate PR bleeding within 24h of abdominal pain onset [3][5][6] | ***CVS risk factors, acute MI, stroke*** [3][5]. Sudden cramping abdominal pain → bloody diarrhoea. Watershed area distribution |
| ***Colitis — Infective*** | Bloody diarrhoea with systemic symptoms [3][5] | ***Fever, chills, rigors, night sweats, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, pain. TOCC, immunosuppression (CMV colitis). Previous TB exposure/infection, BCG vaccination status*** [3][5] |
| ***Radiation proctocolitis*** | Chronic PR bleeding, may be delayed years | ***Hx of abdominal irradiation*** [3][5]. Diarrhoea, rectal urgency/tenesmus. Obliterative endarteritis → chronic mucosal ischaemia [3] |
| ***Haemorrhoids*** | ***Blood coating stools or bleeding following defecation*** [5] | ***May note perianal prolapsing mass, pruritus (mucus secretion) ± pain (if thrombosed)*** [5]. Outlet-type: fresh red blood on paper/surface of stool. Risk factors: constipation, pregnancy [8] |
| ***Anal fissure*** | Small amount of bright blood on paper/surface of stool [4][5] | ***Hx of constipation. Severe sharp pain upon defecation*** [5]. Posterior midline tear. If off-midline or atypical → think Crohn's, TB, HIV, cancer [4] |
| ***Rectal prolapse*** | Blood with mucus discharge | Prolapsing mass, faecal incontinence, incomplete evacuation. ***Often missed (a Murtagh pitfall)*** [1]. Mainly elderly women [4] |

<Callout title="The Bleeding Pattern is Your Best Differentiator" type="idea">
- **Outlet-type** (on paper, after defecation): haemorrhoids, fissure
- **Mixed with stool**: proximal colonic source (CRC, IBD, right-sided diverticular)
- **Blood by itself (torrential)**: diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, rectal varices
- **Blood + mucus**: rectal tumour, proctitis, villous adenoma [1][8]
- ***Frequent passage of blood and mucus indicates a rectal tumour or proctitis*** [1]
</Callout>

### 4. Age-Based Differential — A Practical Shortcut

One of the highest-yield clinical shortcuts is to consider the most likely diagnosis by age group:

| Age Group | Most Likely Cause | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Children** | ***Intussusception*** [1], Meckel's diverticulum, polyps, infectious colitis | Intussusception: ileocolic telescoping → "redcurrant jelly" stool. Meckel's: ectopic gastric mucosa → ileal ulceration |
| ***Young adults*** | ***Haemorrhoids or a fissure*** [1] | Low-fibre diet, constipation, straining. IBD also peaks in this age group (20–40y) |
| **Adults 40–55** | Haemorrhoids, IBD, polyps, early CRC | Need to start considering malignancy, especially with red flags |
| ***Adults > 55*** | ***New bleeding demands colonic investigation*** [1] | CRC incidence rises steeply. Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia also become prevalent |
| ***Elderly (> 65)*** | Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, CRC, ischaemic colitis | Degenerative vascular changes, high prevalence of diverticulosis, cardiovascular comorbidities predisposing to ischaemic colitis |

---

### 5. Differentiating by Mechanism — "Why Does This Condition Bleed?"

Understanding the *mechanism* of bleeding is essential for exam answers and for choosing the right treatment.

| Cause | Mechanism of Bleeding | Type | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Diverticular disease** | Vasa recta rupture (arterial) into diverticulum | Arterial | ***Can be severe/massive*** [3] |
| **Angiodysplasia** | Thin-walled submucosal AVM rupture (venous) | Venous | Usually moderate, but recurrent [2][3] |
| **CRC** | Surface erosion/ulceration of tumour | Capillary ooze | Low-grade, chronic, intermittent [3] |
| **IBD (UC)** | Diffuse mucosal inflammation → friability | Mucosal | Variable — usually moderate, rarely life-threatening [3] |
| **Ischaemic colitis** | Mucosal ischaemia → sloughing → reperfusion injury | Mixed | Usually mild-to-moderate [6] |
| **Haemorrhoids** | Engorgement of arteriovenous cushion plexus | Arterial (from superior rectal artery branches) | Usually mild; rarely massive |
| **Anal fissure** | Tear through anoderm exposing submucosal vessels | Capillary/small vessel | Minimal — drops on paper |
| **Rectal varices** | Portosystemic collateral dilatation (portal HTN) | Venous (portal) | ***Can be severe*** [3] |
| **Meckel's diverticulum** | Ectopic gastric mucosa → acid → adjacent ulceration | Arterial | ***Can be massive*** [3] |

### 6. Special Differentials Often Tested

#### 6.1 Haemorrhoids vs. Rectal Prolapse vs. Prolapsed Rectal Polyp

This is a favourite exam question because all three present with "something coming out of the anus."

| Feature | Prolapsed Haemorrhoids | Complete Rectal Prolapse | Prolapsed Polyp |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mucosal folds** | Radial (spoke-like grooves between cushions) | **Concentric** (circular rings — full thickness wall) | Smooth, pedunculated mass |
| **Positions** | 3, 7, 11 o'clock | Circumferential | Variable, usually single |
| **Palpation** | Soft, compressible | Full-thickness wall feel (like "doughnut") | Firm, polypoid |
| **Associated features** | Pruritus, mucus, outlet bleeding | Faecal incontinence (75%), mucus discharge | Often incidental; may bleed |
| **Demographics** | Any age; risk: straining, pregnancy | Elderly women [4] | Any age; ↑ with age |

#### 6.2 Diverticular Bleeding vs. Angiodysplasia

Both are common causes of painless LGIB in the elderly and a frequent comparison in exams:

| Feature | Diverticular Bleeding | Angiodysplasia |
|---|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Arterial (vasa recta rupture) | Venous (thin-walled AVM) |
| **Severity** | ***Can be massive/profuse*** | Less massive, more intermittent |
| **Self-limiting** | 80–85% [3] | 85–90% [3] |
| **Rebleeding** | 14–38% [3] | 25–85% [3] — higher recurrence |
| **Site** | Right > left (especially in Asia) | Right colon / caecum |
| **Associations** | Age, obesity, NSAIDs, aspirin | ***Aortic stenosis (Heyde syndrome), HHT, ESRD*** |
| **Endoscopy** | Active bleeding / visible vessel / clot in diverticulum | ***Cherry-red spots*** [8] |
| **Angiography** | Contrast extravasation | ***"Mother-in-law phenomenon"*** (early filling, delayed emptying) [8] |

#### 6.3 Upper vs. Lower GI Bleed

***Always consider an upper GI source, especially in severe haematochezia*** [1][3][5].

| Feature | Upper GI Bleed | Lower GI Bleed |
|---|---|---|
| **Typical presentation** | Haematemesis, coffee ground vomitus, melaena | Haematochezia (bright/dark red PR blood) |
| **NG aspirate** | Bloody or coffee-ground | Clear (may have bile if pylorus patent) |
| **BUN:Creatinine ratio** | > 30:1 (blood in upper GI is "digested" → urea absorbed) | Normal |
| **Haemodynamic status** | More commonly unstable for a given degree of haematochezia | Variable |
| **Key pitfall** | ***10–15% of haematochezia is from UGI source*** — must do OGD if massive bleeding source unclear [3][5] |

#### 6.4 Differential Diagnosis of Bleeding in Cirrhotic Patients

Cirrhotic patients deserve special mention because bleeding may come from multiple concurrent sources [10][11]:

- ***Variceal bleeding (50–90%)***: oesophageal or gastric varices [11]
- **Portal hypertensive gastropathy**: friable "snake-skin" mucosa → diffuse oozing [10]
- ***Rectal varices***: portosystemic shunt between superior and inferior rectal veins [3]
- **Peptic ulcer disease**: still common in cirrhotics
- **Generalised bleeding tendency**: pancytopenia (hypersplenism), ↓ coagulation factor production [10]
- **Mallory-Weiss syndrome**: especially in alcoholic cirrhosis [10][11]

<Callout title="Exam Pitfall — Bleeding in Cirrhotics" type="error">
Do NOT assume all GI bleeding in a cirrhotic patient is variceal. ***Variceal bleeding is NOT the only cause of GI bleeding in a cirrhotic patient*** [11]. You must do an OGD to identify the actual source — it may be a peptic ulcer, portal hypertensive gastropathy, or even a Mallory-Weiss tear.
</Callout>

### 7. Differential Diagnosis by Presenting Complaint Pattern

Sometimes the exam gives you a clinical vignette rather than asking you to list causes. Here is how to approach common presentations:

| Presentation | Top Differentials | Key Discriminators |
|---|---|---|
| **Painless massive PR bleed in elderly** | Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia | Diverticular = profuse single episode; angiodysplasia = less massive but more recurrent |
| **Painful PR bleeding with defecation** | Anal fissure | Tearing pain, posterior midline, small amount on paper |
| **Painless outlet-type fresh blood + prolapsing mass** | Haemorrhoids (internal) | 3, 7, 11 o'clock; reducible (grade 2–3) or irreducible (grade 4) |
| **Bloody diarrhoea + abdominal pain + fever** | Infective colitis, IBD flare | TOCC, antibiotics (C. diff), extra-intestinal features (IBD) |
| **Bloody diarrhoea + sudden abdominal pain in elderly** | Ischaemic colitis | CVS risk factors, watershed area tenderness, ↑WCC/lactate |
| **Change in bowel habit + PR blood + weight loss** | Colorectal carcinoma | Age > 50, family history, tenesmus, pencil-thin stools |
| **PR bleeding + history of pelvic radiotherapy** | Radiation proctocolitis | Can present acutely (< 6 weeks) or delayed (> 9 months, even > 10 years) [3] |
| **PR bleeding + known liver disease** | Rectal varices, variceal bleed, PHG, PUD | Look for stigmata of chronic liver disease; OGD essential |
| **PR bleeding in a child** | Intussusception, Meckel's diverticulum, polyp | Intussusception: colicky pain, "redcurrant jelly" stool, sausage-shaped mass; Meckel's: painless massive bleed |

### 9. Don't-Miss Differentials — Expanded Reasoning

#### 9.1 ***Colorectal Cancer*** [1][5][8]

Why you must not miss it: ***CRC is the most common cancer by incidence in Hong Kong*** [5]. Early detection dramatically improves survival (5-year survival stage I ~90% vs stage IV ~10%). Every patient with PR bleeding, especially ***new bleeding age > 55 years***, must have colonic investigation [1].

**Discriminating features in history** [3][5][8]:
- ***Constitutional symptoms: weight loss, anorexia, malaise***
- ***Change in bowel habits: alternating diarrhoea and constipation***
- ***Change in stool calibre*** — pencil-thin stools from luminal narrowing [8]
- ***Tenesmus*** — mass in rectum mimicking residual stool [8]
- ***IO symptoms*** (in advanced cases): abdominal distension, colicky pain, vomiting [8]
- ***Metastatic symptoms***: jaundice (liver), bone pain, SOB (lungs), ascites (peritoneum) [5]
- ***Family history*** of CRC or polyposis syndromes [5][8]
- Previous colonoscopy/FOBT results, personal history of polyps or IBD [8]

**Clinical pearl — "Right side bleeds, left side blocks"** [8]:
- **Right colon**: wider lumen, liquid stool → tumour grows large before causing symptoms → presents with **occult bleeding and iron deficiency anaemia** rather than overt haematochezia
- **Left colon**: narrower lumen, solid stool → **obstructive symptoms** (alternating bowel habit, colicky pain) + visible PR bleeding
- **Rectosigmoid**: ***haematochezia is the earliest and most common symptom***; tenesmus, bloody mucoid discharge, pencil-thin stools [8]

#### 9.2 ***Intussusception*** [1][4]

Listed under "serious disorders not to be missed" in Murtagh's [1]. In adults, intussusception is uncommon but when it occurs, a pathological **lead point** (polyp, lymphoma, Meckel's diverticulum) is often present [4]. In children, most cases are ileocolic and idiopathic (hypertrophied Peyer's patches acting as lead points after viral infection) [4].

**Classic triad in children**: colicky abdominal pain (episodic, with drawing-up of legs) + vomiting + "redcurrant jelly" stools (blood + mucus from mucosal venous congestion and ischaemia of the intussuscepted segment).

#### 9.3 ***Villous Adenoma*** [1]

Listed both as a "serious disorder" and a "pitfall" in Murtagh's — ***often missed*** [1]. Large villous adenomas (particularly rectal) can secrete copious mucus → present with **mucoid PR discharge**, sometimes with enough fluid and electrolyte loss to cause **hypokalaemia** and **dehydration** (secretory villous adenoma). They also have the **highest malignant potential** among colorectal polyps.

#### 9.4 ***Anticoagulant Therapy*** [1]

Listed under "vascular" serious disorders [1]. Patients on warfarin, DOACs, or heparin are at increased risk of GI bleeding from *any* pre-existing lesion. The anticoagulant doesn't create the lesion — it **unmasks** it by preventing haemostasis at a site that would otherwise clot off. An important clinical pearl: ***PR bleeding in an anticoagulated patient still warrants investigation for the underlying lesion (especially CRC)*** — don't just blame the anticoagulant.

| | Anal fissure | Tearing pain, posterior midline | Mucosal tear + sphincter spasm |
| | Rectal prolapse | Prolapsing mass, incontinence | Pelvic floor weakness |
| | Anal fistula | Intermittent discharge + pain | Cryptoglandular infection |

| | Aortoenteric fistula | "Herald bleed" then massive | Graft erosion |
| **Iatrogenic** | Post-polypectomy | Bleeding after recent colonoscopy | Vessel disruption at polypectomy site |
| | Anticoagulant therapy | Any pre-existing lesion unmasked | Impaired haemostasis |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis of Rectal Bleeding">

**Murtagh's framework**: Probability (haemorrhoids, fissure, polyp, diverticular disease) → Serious (ischaemic colitis, angiodysplasia, anticoagulants, infections, CRC, lymphoma, villous adenoma, IBD, intussusception) → Pitfalls (rectal prolapse, anal trauma, villous adenoma) → Rarities (Meckel's, solitary rectal ulcer).

**By age**: Young → haemorrhoids/fissure. > 55 → must investigate colon. Elderly → diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, CRC, ischaemic colitis.

**By bleeding pattern**: Outlet-type → anorectal. Mixed with stool → proximal colon. Torrential by itself → diverticular/angiodysplasia. Blood + mucus → rectal tumour/proctitis. Melaena → upper GI.

**Don't-miss rules**: (1) 10–15% of haematochezia is from UGIB. (2) CRC must be excluded in patients > 55 with new bleeding. (3) 80% rectal tumours are within fingertip reach. (4) Haemorrhoids don't explain away bleeding — always exclude other sources. (5) In cirrhotics, not all bleeding is variceal — do OGD. (6) Right side bleeds, left side blocks (CRC). (7) Anticoagulant-related bleeding still needs investigation for the underlying lesion.
