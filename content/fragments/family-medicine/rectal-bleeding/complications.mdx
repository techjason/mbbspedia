## Complications of Rectal Bleeding

Complications of rectal bleeding arise from two broad categories: **(A) complications of the bleeding itself** (i.e. what happens when you lose blood) and **(B) complications of the underlying cause** (i.e. what the disease that caused the bleeding goes on to do if left untreated) and **(C) complications of treatment** (i.e. iatrogenic harm from the investigations and interventions we use to manage the bleeding). A systematic understanding of all three is essential.

---

### 1. Complications of the Bleeding Itself

These are the **direct physiological consequences of blood loss** and apply regardless of the underlying aetiology.

#### 1.1 Hypovolaemic Shock

> ***Shock: extreme thirst, confusion, pallor, oliguria*** [3]

**Pathophysiology from first principles:**
- Acute blood loss → ↓ circulating volume → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac preload → ↓ stroke volume → ↓ cardiac output → ↓ tissue perfusion → end-organ ischaemia
- The body compensates initially via sympathetic activation: tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction (cold clammy extremities, pallor, delayed capillary refill), ↑ renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (Na⁺/H₂O retention to restore volume), ADH release (water retention, oliguria)
- When compensation is overwhelmed (typically > 30–40% blood volume loss) → decompensated shock → hypotension, confusion, obtundation, anuria

**Clinical grading of haemorrhagic shock:**

| Class | Blood Loss | Heart Rate | BP | Mental Status | Urine Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | < 15% ( < 750 mL) | Normal or slight ↑ | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| II | 15–30% (750–1500 mL) | > 100 | Normal (↓ pulse pressure) | Anxious | 20–30 mL/h |
| III | 30–40% (1500–2000 mL) | > 120 | ↓ | Confused | 5–15 mL/h |
| IV | > 40% ( > 2000 mL) | > 140 | ↓↓ | Obtunded | Negligible |

> Why does the body get confused? The brain requires ~15% of cardiac output. When CO drops sufficiently, cerebral perfusion falls below the autoregulatory threshold → neuronal dysfunction → confusion, agitation, eventually obtundation. This is a **late and ominous sign**.

**Complications of shock itself:**
- **Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)**: prolonged hypoperfusion damages kidneys (acute tubular necrosis → acute kidney injury), liver (ischaemic hepatitis), gut (bacterial translocation → sepsis), lungs (ARDS)
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: massive tissue injury and hypoperfusion activate the coagulation cascade diffusely → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → paradoxical simultaneous clotting AND bleeding
- **The lethal triad**: hypothermia + metabolic acidosis + coagulopathy — each worsens the others in a self-perpetuating cycle (discussed in the Management section)

#### 1.2 Symptomatic Anaemia

> ***Symptomatic anaemia: SOB on exertion, postural dizziness, syncope, chest pain, palpitation, lethargy or fatigue*** [3]

**Acute anaemia** (from acute blood loss):
- Rapid drop in oxygen-carrying capacity → compensatory tachycardia, ↑ respiratory rate, ↑ 2,3-DPG (shifts oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve rightward → more O₂ unloaded to tissues)
- If severe → myocardial ischaemia (chest pain, ST changes on ECG), syncope, acute heart failure (especially in elderly patients with pre-existing cardiac disease)

**Chronic anaemia** (from occult bleeding — e.g. CRC, angiodysplasia):
- ***Iron deficiency anaemia*** — chronic blood loss depletes iron stores → impaired haemoglobin synthesis → microcytic, hypochromic anaemia
- Gradual onset allows better compensation, so patients may tolerate remarkably low Hb levels (e.g. Hb 5–6 g/dL) before becoming symptomatic
- Symptoms: fatigue, exertional dyspnoea, pallor, koilonychia (spoon nails), angular cheilitis, glossitis, pica (craving non-food substances like ice or clay)
- The anaemia itself is not the complication per se — **it is the clue that leads you to the diagnosis**. An unexplained iron deficiency anaemia in any adult mandates investigation of the GI tract (OGD + colonoscopy) to exclude malignancy

<Callout title="Acute-on-Chronic Anaemia">
A patient with chronic occult bleeding (e.g. right-sided CRC) may have adapted to a low Hb. An acute bleeding episode on top of this → sudden further drop in an already depleted oxygen-carrying capacity → disproportionate haemodynamic compromise. This is why comorbidities (especially cardiopulmonary disease) make patients ***more susceptible to hypoxaemia*** [3].
</Callout>

#### 1.3 Complications of Massive Transfusion

When patients receive large volumes of blood products (typically defined as ≥ 10 units pRBC in 24h or replacement of entire blood volume), they are at risk of:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Hyperkalaemia** | Stored blood leaks intracellular K⁺ over time; rapid transfusion delivers a potassium bolus → cardiac arrhythmias |
| **Hypocalcaemia** | Citrate anticoagulant in stored blood chelates calcium → ↓ ionised Ca²⁺ → myocardial depression, coagulopathy, tetany |
| **Hypothermia** | Stored blood is refrigerated at 4°C; rapid infusion drops core temperature → ↓ clotting factor efficiency, cardiac arrhythmias |
| **Dilutional coagulopathy** | Packed RBCs contain no clotting factors or platelets; replacing blood volume with pRBC alone "dilutes" the remaining clotting factors → bleeding worsens |
| **Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)** | Donor antibodies against recipient WBC antigens → non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema → acute hypoxia within 6h of transfusion |
| **Volume overload (TACO)** | Especially in patients with HF or RF → pulmonary oedema |
| **Transfusion reactions** | Febrile, allergic, haemolytic (ABO incompatibility) |

---

### 2. Complications of the Underlying Causes

These are the complications that arise from the **diseases responsible for the bleeding**, either from the natural history of the disease or if treatment is delayed.

#### 2.1 Diverticular Disease

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Recurrent bleeding** | ***14–38% rebleeding rate*** after first episode [3]; the structural abnormality (vasa recta draped over diverticulum) persists | Often indication for semi-elective segmental resection after 2nd episode [3] |
| **Diverticulitis** | Obstruction of diverticulum by faecolith → stasis → bacterial overgrowth → inflammation (note: ***diverticulitis and diverticular bleeding rarely coexist*** [3]) | Triad of lower abdominal pain + fever + leucocytosis |
| **Pericolic/pelvic abscess** | Microperforation of inflamed diverticulum contained by pericolic fat and mesentery → abscess formation | Persistent fever despite antibiotics; tender mass on PR; managed by IV antibiotics ± percutaneous drainage depending on ***Hinchey classification*** [8a] |
| **Perforation with peritonitis** | Free perforation of diverticulum → faecal contamination of peritoneal cavity → generalised peritonitis and sepsis | ***Hinchey III (purulent peritonitis) or IV (faecal peritonitis)*** → emergency Hartmann's operation. ***Mortality up to 20% if perforated with diffuse peritonitis*** [5] |
| **Fistula formation** | Inflammation erodes into adjacent organ → abnormal communication. ***Most common: colovesical fistula*** → recurrent dysuria, pneumaturia, faecaluria [8a] | Also: colovaginal (feculent vaginal discharge), coloenteric, colocutaneous |
| **Stricture and obstruction** | Repeated inflammation → fibrosis and scarring → luminal narrowing → LBO (large bowel obstruction). SBO from adhesions to inflamed bowel [8a] | Chronic abdominal pain, constipation, progressive obstructive symptoms |

#### 2.2 Haemorrhoids

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Strangulation and thrombosis*** | Prolapsed internal haemorrhoids (Grade IV) become trapped by anal sphincter spasm → venous congestion → swelling → cannot reduce → if blood supply cut off → strangulation → thrombosis → intense pain [4] |
| ***Gangrene*** | Sustained strangulation → complete ischaemia → necrosis of haemorrhoidal tissue [4] |
| ***Ulceration*** | Chronically prolapsed haemorrhoids exposed to friction and pressure → mucosal ulceration → secondary infection [4] |
| ***Fibrosis*** | Chronic inflammation → replacement of vascular cushion with fibrous tissue → hard, non-reducible mass [4] |
| ***Portal pyaemia*** | Extremely rare but life-threatening — thrombosed haemorrhoidal veins (draining into portal system above dentate line) → septic thrombophlebitis → portal venous bacteraemia → liver abscesses [4] |
| **Iron deficiency anaemia** | Chronic low-grade bleeding from haemorrhoids → iron depletion over months/years |

#### 2.3 Anal Fissure

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Chronicity** | Failure of the acute fissure to heal (> 6 weeks) → development of the chronic fissure triad: sentinel skin tag (external), hypertrophied anal papilla (internal), and exposed internal sphincter fibres at the base of the fissure [4] |
| **Abscess and fistula** | Deep chronic fissure can become a portal of entry for infection → perianal abscess → fistula-in-ano (especially if secondary cause like Crohn's) |
| **Faecal avoidance and constipation** | Pain on defecation → patient avoids opening bowels → harder stools → worsens the fissure on next attempt → vicious cycle |

#### 2.4 Colorectal Cancer

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Presentation |
|---|---|---|
| **Bowel obstruction** | Tumour growth narrows the lumen → partial then complete obstruction. More common with ***left-sided tumours*** (narrower lumen, solid stool). Circumferential "napkin-ring" lesions are the classic culprits | Colicky abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, absolute constipation. ***If competent ileocaecal valve → closed-loop obstruction → risk of caecal perforation*** |
| **Perforation** | Tumour erodes through the bowel wall, or ischaemic necrosis of the tumour itself, or perforation proximal to an obstructing lesion (caecal blow-out from closed-loop obstruction) | Acute abdomen, peritonitis, septic shock. ***Rigidity, guarding, rebound tenderness*** [16] |
| **Fistula formation** | Tumour invades adjacent organs → rectovesical fistula (faecaluria, pneumaturia, recurrent UTI), rectovaginal fistula (feculent vaginal discharge) [5][16] | |
| **Local invasion** | Direct extension into: sacral nerves → ***intractable pelvic pain***; bladder trigone → LUTS; ureter → hydroureter/hydronephrosis [5] | |
| **Metastatic disease** | Liver (most common — via portal venous drainage) → jaundice, RUQ pain, hepatomegaly. Lung → SOB, cough. Peritoneum → ascites. Bone → pain. Brain → neurological deficits [5] | |
| **Iron deficiency anaemia** | Chronic occult blood loss from tumour surface erosion → progressive iron depletion | May be the presenting feature of right-sided CRC |

#### 2.5 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Toxic megacolon*** | Severe colitis → inflammation extends beyond mucosa into muscle layer → loss of muscular tone → massive non-obstructive colonic dilatation (≥ 6 cm transverse colon or > 9 cm caecum) + systemic toxicity (fever > 38°C, HR > 120, anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia). More common in UC but can occur in Crohn's colitis [17]. ***AXR shows grossly dilated colon (3-6-9 rule) with thumbprinting***. Risk of perforation. Mx: bowel rest, IV steroids, broad-spectrum Abx; 50% require urgent colectomy [17] |
| ***Fulminant colitis*** | Severe acute flare: > 10 bloody stools/day, continuous bleeding, abdominal pain and distension, fever, anorexia. High risk of progressing to toxic megacolon [16a] |
| ***Perforation*** | Most commonly as a consequence of toxic megacolon. ***Associated with high mortality*** [16a] |
| **Stricture** | Repeated inflammation → fibrosis → luminal narrowing → obstruction. ***Should be considered malignant until proven otherwise by endoscopy with biopsy*** [16a] |
| ***Colorectal cancer*** | Chronic mucosal inflammation → dysplasia → carcinoma sequence. Risk increases with ***↑ extent and ↑ duration of colitis*** (pancolitis > left-sided). Time frame: ~8–10 years after onset in extensive disease [17]. Requires surveillance colonoscopy |
| **Malnutrition** | Poor intake + protein-losing enteropathy + malabsorption → weight loss, vitamin deficiencies (B12, folate, iron), coagulopathy, osteomalacia [17] |
| **Perianal disease** (Crohn's) | Anal fissures (20%), perianal fistulae (20–30%), anorectal abscesses (~50%) [17] |
| ***Severe haemorrhage*** | Up to 10% of Crohn's patients; may require urgent colectomy [17] |

#### 2.6 Ischaemic Colitis

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Transmural necrosis** | Prolonged ischaemia → full-thickness bowel wall infarction (occurs in ~15% — the majority have only mucosal/submucosal injury with reperfusion recovery) [6] |
| **Perforation and peritonitis** | Necrotic bowel loses structural integrity → perforation → faecal peritonitis → septic shock |
| **Stricture** | Ischaemic injury heals with fibrosis → luminal narrowing → chronic obstruction |
| **Sepsis and MODS** | Bacterial translocation across damaged mucosa → systemic sepsis → organ failure |

---

### 3. Complications of Treatment (Iatrogenic)

#### 3.1 Complications of Colonoscopy [16b]

| Phase | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-operative** | ***Sedation-related***: hypoxaemia, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, AMI [16b] | Most frequent complication class; due to benzodiazepines/opioids used for sedation |
| | ***Bowel preparation***: fluid and electrolyte disturbances, nausea/vomiting [16b] | Large-volume PEG solutions cause fluid shifts |
| **Intra-operative** | ***Bleeding***: from biopsy site or polypectomy site | Disruption of submucosal vessels; usually self-limited |
| | ***Perforation***: most feared complication | Mechanical (scope tip), barotrauma (air insufflation), or thermal (electrocautery during polypectomy). Gas insufflation through a perforation → pneumoperitoneum → abdominal compartment syndrome [16b] |
| **Post-operative** | ***Delayed bleeding*** (typically day 5–7) | Sloughing of the coagulation eschar that was covering a blood vessel after polypectomy [16b] |
| | ***Post-polypectomy syndrome*** | Electrocoagulation injury → transmural burn → focal peritonitis *without* frank perforation. Presents with fever, focal tenderness, leucocytosis 1–5 days post-polypectomy [16b]. Usually managed conservatively (NPO, IV antibiotics) |

#### 3.2 Complications of Endoscopic Haemostasis

| Modality | Complication |
|---|---|
| **Adrenaline injection** | Rebleeding after absorption (~1h); rarely systemic effects (tachycardia, hypertension) if large volume absorbed |
| **Thermal (heat probe, APC)** | ***Perforation*** — thermal injury penetrates too deep, especially in thin-walled structures (caecum, right colon). APC is safer (↓ energy depth) but not risk-free [3a][5a] |
| **Haemoclips** | Clip displacement → rebleeding; rarely perforation from mechanical pressure |
| **Band ligation (RBL)** | ***Pain, bleeding 7–10 days post-banding*** due to sloughing of ligated tissue. ***Contraindicated in patients on anticoagulants or immunocompromised*** [7]. Post-banding sepsis (rare but life-threatening) |

#### 3.3 Complications of Mesenteric Angiography / TAE

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Intestinal ischaemia/infarction** | Embolisation material occludes not only the target vessel but also collateral supply → downstream bowel ischaemia. Risk is higher with non-super-selective embolisation [3] |
| **Arterial dissection or perforation** | Catheter manipulation in diseased (atherosclerotic) vessels |
| **Contrast nephropathy** | Iodinated contrast → direct tubular toxicity + renal vasoconstriction → AKI. Risk factors: pre-existing CKD, diabetes, dehydration |
| **Groin haematoma / pseudoaneurysm** | Arterial puncture site complications |
| **Rebleeding** | Target vessel recanalises or collateral pathways open → bleeding recurs |

#### 3.4 Complications of Colorectal Surgery [5][13][16]

These apply to segmental colectomy, subtotal colectomy, low anterior resection, APR, and Hartmann's procedure — the operations performed for bleeding-related conditions (diverticular disease, CRC, IBD, etc.).

**Immediate / Intra-operative:**
- General anaesthetic risks
- Bleeding: ***injury to spleen*** (splenic flexure mobilisation in TME), presacral venous plexus, major vessels [13]
- ***Injury to neighbouring structures***: ***left ureter and gonadal vessels***, iliac artery, duodenum, bladder, seminal vesicles, ***autonomic nerve injury*** (especially in rectal surgery) [13]
  - **Sympathetic nerve injury** → urinary incontinence, impaired ejaculation
  - **Parasympathetic nerve injury** → urinary retention, erectile dysfunction [13]

**Early ( < 30 days):**
- ***Surgical site infection*** (5–15%) [16]
- ***Post-operative ileus*** — temporary impairment of bowel motility after abdominal surgery; resolves spontaneously in most cases [16]
- ***Anastomotic leakage*** — ***classically on day 4–7*** [5]. Incidence: 1–5% overall but ***up to 10% in low anterior resection*** (ileoileal < ileocolic < colocolic < ileoanal) [5]. Risk factors: liver/renal impairment, steroid use, suboptimal bowel condition, emergency surgery, surgeon experience. Presents as ***diffuse feculent peritonitis + septic shock*** (free leak) or ***abscess/enterocutaneous fistula*** (contained leak) [5][16]
- DVT/PE (immobilisation-related)
- Early stoma complications: stomal bleeding, ***stomal necrosis***, stomal retraction, mucocutaneous separation, ***skin irritation and dermatitis*** (most common in ileostomy due to high-output alkaline enzymatic effluent) [16]

**Late ( > 30 days):**
- ***Anastomotic stricture*** — may require finger dilatation (low anastomosis) or endoscopic balloon dilatation (high anastomosis) [16]
- ***Fistula***: enterocutaneous (most close spontaneously), rectovaginal/rectourinary (require proximal faecal diversion) [16]
- Late stoma complications: ***parastomal hernia, stomal prolapse, stomal stenosis*** [16]
- ***Low anterior resection (LAR) syndrome***: change in bowel movement (frequency, urgency, faecal incontinence) persisting ≥ 1 month after surgery due to ***colonic dysmotility, neorectal reservoir dysfunction, and anal sphincter dysfunction*** [13]. Prevention: post-op ***pelvic floor muscle exercise*** [13]. Management: antidiarrhoeal, transanal irrigation, pelvic floor rehab, sacral nerve stimulation [13]
- ***Anterior resection syndrome*** — encompasses fecal frequency, urgency, clustering, and incontinence after rectal resection [16]

#### 3.5 Complications of Haemorrhoidectomy [7]

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism/Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Early** | ***Pain (~100%)*** | Due to ***internal anal sphincter (IAS) spasm*** [7] |
| | ***Urinary retention*** | Multifactorial: pain → reflex sphincter spasm, fluid overload, rectal packing, drugs (narcotics, anticholinergics), pre-existing outflow tract obstruction. Mx: urinary catheter for 24h [7] |
| | Reactionary haemorrhage | Bleeding within 24h, usually from slipped ligature |
| **Late** | Secondary haemorrhage | Bleeding at 7–14 days due to infection and sloughing of tissue |
| | ***Faecal incontinence*** | Injury to internal or external anal sphincter during excision [7] |
| | ***Anal stenosis*** | Excessive tissue excision, especially if circumferential. This is why the 3-leaf clover technique preserves mucosal bridges [7] |
| | ***Anal fissure*** | Post-operative scarring narrows the anal canal → hard stools tear the anoderm |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Rectal Bleeding">

**From the bleeding:** Hypovolaemic shock (tachycardia → hypotension → confusion → oliguria → death). Symptomatic anaemia (acute: syncope, chest pain; chronic: iron deficiency with koilonychia, glossitis). Massive transfusion complications (lethal triad of hypothermia + acidosis + coagulopathy; hyperkalaemia, hypocalcaemia, TRALI).

**From the underlying cause:** Always think about what happens if you DON'T treat the disease. CRC → obstruction, perforation, metastases. Diverticular disease → recurrent bleeding (14–38%), diverticulitis, abscess, perforation, fistula. IBD → toxic megacolon (3-6-9 rule on AXR), fulminant colitis, long-term CRC risk. Haemorrhoids → strangulation, thrombosis, gangrene.

**From treatment:** Colonoscopy perforation is the most feared complication. Anastomotic leak classically presents day 4–7 with sepsis. Haemorrhoidectomy → pain (100%), urinary retention, faecal incontinence, anal stenosis. Post-RBL bleeding at 7–10 days. TAE → intestinal ischaemia. Blind segmental resection → 75% rebleeding rate.

**Key exam numbers:** Anastomotic leak 1–5% (up to 10% in LAR). Haemorrhoidectomy efficacy 95%. RBL: 70% resolve, 30% recur. Diverticular rebleeding 14–38%. Toxic megacolon: 50% respond to medical Rx, 50% need urgent colectomy.
