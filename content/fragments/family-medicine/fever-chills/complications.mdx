## Complications of Fever/Chills

### Conceptual Framework

Complications of fever/chills can be divided into two broad categories:

1. **Complications of the fever itself** — direct consequences of elevated body temperature and the systemic inflammatory response
2. **Complications of the underlying cause** — organ-specific damage from whatever is driving the fever (infection, inflammation, malignancy)

In clinical practice, these overlap heavily. Sepsis, for example, produces both fever-related metabolic stress *and* infection-mediated organ damage simultaneously. The key insight is: **most serious complications arise from the underlying cause, not the fever per se**. Fever itself is rarely lethal unless it reaches hyperpyrexic levels (> 41°C) or occurs in patients with limited physiological reserve.

---

### A. Direct Complications of Fever

These occur because fever is metabolically expensive — it demands more from the heart, lungs, brain, and kidneys than the body may be able to deliver.

#### 1. Febrile Seizures (Paediatric)

- **Epidemiology**: Affect 2–5% of children aged 6 months to 5 years. Most common neurological disorder in childhood
- **Pathophysiology**: Not fully understood, but elevated temperature lowers the seizure threshold in the immature brain. IL-1β acts directly on hippocampal neurons to increase neuronal excitability. Genetic susceptibility plays a major role (strong family clustering)
- **Classification**:
  - **Simple febrile seizure** (70–75%): generalized, < 15 minutes, single episode in 24 hours, no postictal focal deficits. Excellent prognosis — does NOT increase epilepsy risk significantly
  - **Complex febrile seizure**: focal features, > 15 minutes, or recurrent within 24 hours. Slightly ↑ risk of subsequent epilepsy (~2–4% vs 1% baseline)
- **Management**: Acute management of the seizure (ABC, recovery position, benzodiazepine if prolonged > 5 minutes). Investigate for cause of fever (especially meningitis in < 12 months). Antipyretics for comfort but **do NOT reliably prevent febrile seizures**
- **Prognosis**: 30–40% recurrence risk. Risk of subsequent epilepsy is only 1–2% after simple febrile seizure (essentially same as general population)

#### 2. Dehydration and Electrolyte Disturbances

- **Mechanism**: Fever increases insensible fluid losses by ~200–500 mL/day per °C above normal through:
  - ↑Sweating (particularly during defervescence)
  - ↑Respiratory water loss from tachypnoea
  - ↓Oral intake from anorexia and malaise (TNF-α-mediated)
- **Consequences**: Pre-renal AKI (↓renal perfusion → ↑urea disproportionate to creatinine), electrolyte derangement (hyponatraemia from ADH release, hypokalaemia from sweating/vomiting)
- **Vulnerable groups**: Elderly (↓thirst sensation, ↓renal concentrating ability), infants (high body surface area:volume ratio → ↑insensible losses), patients with heart failure or CKD

#### 3. Cardiovascular Stress

- **Mechanism**: Each 1°C rise increases O₂ consumption by 10–12.5%, heart rate by 8–10 bpm, and cardiac output proportionally. This is tolerated well by healthy individuals but can overwhelm those with limited reserve.
- **Consequences**:
  - **Acute coronary syndrome**: ↑O₂ demand may outstrip supply in patients with coronary stenosis → demand ischaemia
  - **Cardiac arrhythmia**: ***especially AF***, triggered by adrenergic surge and electrolyte disturbance [38]
  - **Decompensated heart failure**: ↑cardiac workload in a failing heart → acute pulmonary oedema
- **Clinical pearl**: This is why fever should be actively treated in patients with limited cardiorespiratory reserve, even though it is adaptive in most healthy individuals

#### 4. Hyperpyrexia and Thermal Organ Damage

- **Definition**: Temperature > 41°C — a medical emergency regardless of cause
- **Pathophysiology**: At extreme temperatures, proteins begin to denature, cellular membranes destabilize, and enzymatic function fails. Direct thermal injury to endothelial cells triggers DIC-like coagulopathy
- **Consequences**: Rhabdomyolysis (muscle cell destruction → myoglobinaemia → AKI from myoglobin cast nephropathy), hepatic necrosis, cerebral oedema, DIC, multi-organ failure
- **Key causes**: Heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, severe CNS infection, drug reactions (including ***malignant hyperthermia: with FHx, can be delayed up to 24 hours post-op, common agents include suxamethonium*** [12])
- **Management**: Aggressive physical cooling — ice packs, evaporative cooling, cold IV fluids, dantrolene for malignant hyperthermia (blocks ryanodine receptors → ↓sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ release → ↓muscle contraction and heat generation)

#### 5. Delirium and Altered Mental Status

- **Mechanism**: Fever is a common precipitant of delirium, especially in the elderly and those with pre-existing cognitive impairment. The mechanisms are multifactorial:
  - Cytokines (IL-1, TNF-α) disrupt BBB integrity → neuroinflammation
  - Altered neurotransmitter metabolism (↑tryptophan → serotonin pathway disruption, ↓acetylcholine)
  - Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance compound cerebral metabolic stress
- **Clinical significance**: Delirium is an ***independent predictor of mortality*** (14% at 1 month, 22% at 6 months) [36]. Delirium can be the *only* presenting sign of serious infection in the elderly
- **Management**: Treat the underlying cause of fever; supportive care; avoid deliriogenic medications; non-pharmacological measures first; haloperidol or low-dose atypical antipsychotics only if patient is a danger to self or others [36]

#### 6. Metabolic and Nutritional Consequences

- **Hypermetabolism**: Fever accelerates catabolism — ↑protein breakdown from skeletal muscle (providing amino acids for gluconeogenesis and acute phase protein synthesis), ↑lipolysis. Prolonged fever → muscle wasting, weight loss, negative nitrogen balance
- **Hypoglycaemia**: Particularly in neonates, malnourished patients, and liver disease. Glycogen stores are rapidly depleted under hypermetabolic stress
- **Anaemia of inflammation**: IL-6 → ↑hepcidin → sequesters iron in macrophages → ↓iron availability for erythropoiesis. TNF-α suppresses erythropoietin production. This develops over days to weeks in sustained fever

---

### B. Complications of the Systemic Inflammatory Response — Sepsis Cascade

When fever is caused by infection and the host response becomes dysregulated, the complications escalate dramatically. This is the sepsis → septic shock → MODS continuum [1][14].

#### Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)

***Progressive organ dysfunction in an acutely ill patient such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention*** [1]. MODS is the most feared complication of severe infection and the leading cause of ICU mortality.

The pathophysiology is a vicious cycle: infection → cytokine storm → endothelial activation → microvascular dysfunction → tissue hypoxia → organ failure → further inflammation.

| System | Complication | Pathophysiology | Key Features |
|--------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| ***Respiratory*** | ***ARDS*** [1][14] | Cytokine-mediated ↑alveolar-capillary permeability → protein-rich oedema fluid floods alveoli → impaired gas exchange + ↓lung compliance. Hyaline membrane formation | ***Acute onset, bilateral opacities on CXR not fully explained by effusion/cardiac failure, PaO₂/FiO₂ ≤ 300 despite PEEP*** [14]. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema → type 1 respiratory failure. Requires mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategy (low tidal volume 6 mL/kg) |
| ***Cardiovascular*** | ***Septic shock*** [1][14] | iNOS induction → massive NO release → vasodilation → ↓SVR. Capillary leak → third-spacing → ↓intravascular volume. Sepsis-induced myocardial depression (cytokines depress myocardial contractility directly) | ***MAP < 65 despite fluids, requiring vasopressors + lactate > 2 mmol/L*** [14]. Mortality 40–50% |
| ***Renal*** | ***Acute tubular necrosis / AKI*** [1] | Renal hypoperfusion (↓MAP) + direct cytokine-mediated tubular injury + microvascular dysfunction → ischaemia of PCT → ATN. ***FENa is increased*** (tubular damage → failure to reabsorb sodium) [14] | Oliguria/anuria, ↑creatinine, ↑urea, metabolic acidosis. May require renal replacement therapy (CRRT in ICU) |
| ***Hepatic*** | ***Jaundice / GI bleeding / Paralytic ileus*** [1] | Hepatic hypoperfusion → "shock liver" (centrilobular necrosis → ↑↑AST/ALT). Kupffer cell activation → ↑bilirubin processing dysfunction → cholestatic jaundice. Splanchnic hypoperfusion → stress ulceration → GI bleeding. Autonomic dysfunction → ↓bowel motility → ileus | ↑Bilirubin, ↑ALT/AST (can be massively ↑ in ischaemic hepatitis), ↓albumin, ↑PT/INR (synthetic failure) |
| ***Neurological*** | ***Septic encephalopathy / Critical illness polyneuropathy*** [1] | Septic encephalopathy: cytokine-mediated BBB disruption, altered neurotransmitter metabolism, cerebral microvascular dysfunction. CIP/CIM: axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves (CIP) and myopathy (CIM) from inflammation + disuse + metabolic derangement | ***Altered mental status, obtundation, restlessness*** [1]. CIP/CIM: diffuse weakness, difficulty weaning from ventilator, ↓reflexes. Diagnosed by EMG/NCS. Recovery is slow (months) |
| ***Haematological*** | ***DIC*** [1] | Tissue factor release from damaged endothelium and monocytes → activation of coagulation cascade → widespread microvascular thrombi → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → paradoxical bleeding | ↑PT/aPTT, ↓fibrinogen, ↑D-dimer, ↓platelets, schistocytes on PBS. Clinical: simultaneous thrombosis (organ ischaemia, skin necrosis, purpura fulminans) AND bleeding (oozing from venepuncture sites, mucosal haemorrhage) |

<Callout title="The Paradox of DIC" type="idea">
DIC is one of the most counterintuitive conditions in medicine: the patient is simultaneously **clotting too much** (microvascular thrombi → organ damage) AND **bleeding** (consumption of platelets and clotting factors). Why? Because the coagulation cascade is activated *systemically* and *uncontrollably* rather than locally at a wound site. The microthrombi consume clotting factors faster than the liver can replace them → eventually, nothing is left to form normal haemostatic plugs at wound sites → bleeding ensues.

### C. Complications of Specific Fever-Causing Conditions

The complications are driven by the underlying aetiology. Here are the high-yield organ-specific and condition-specific complications:

#### 1. Respiratory Infections

| Condition | Complications | Pathophysiology |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ***Pneumonia*** | ***Respiratory failure; lung abscess; septicaemia with multi-organ failure; parapneumonic effusion ± empyema; electrolyte abnormalities (hypoNa due to SIADH); cardiac complications (acute MI, arrhythmia, especially AF)*** [38] | Pneumonia → alveolar inflammation → impaired gas exchange (V/Q mismatch). Necrosis of lung parenchyma → abscess. Infected pleural fluid → empyema (pH < 7.2, glucose < 2.2 mmol/L, LDH > 1000). ADH released from inflamed lung tissue → dilutional hyponatraemia. Systemic inflammation → AF (most common arrhythmia triggered by acute illness) |
| ***TB meningitis*** | ***Basal meningeal adhesions → CN palsies (III, IV, VI, VIII), hydrocephalus; infarction due to endarteritis obliterans; parenchymal damage; spinal spread → myelitis, arachnoiditis, paraparesis; SIADH → hyponatraemia*** [8] | TB produces thick basilar exudate → encases cranial nerves at base of brain → CN palsies. Exudate blocks CSF outflow at cisterns → communicating hydrocephalus. Endarteritis obliterans = inflammation of vessel wall → intimal proliferation → thrombosis → ischaemic infarction. ***Think TBM in CN palsy combinations that don't make sense*** [8] |

#### 2. Hepatobiliary Infections

| Condition | Complications | Pathophysiology |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| ***Liver abscess*** | ***Rupture (especially if large > 6 cm or cirrhosis) → subphrenic abscess, rupture into viscera, IVC or kidney; pleuropulmonary complications (15–20%): pleurisy, pleural effusion, empyema; Budd-Chiari syndrome from local compression*** [4][7] | Large abscess → capsular necrosis → rupture into adjacent structures. Diaphragmatic inflammation from right lobe abscess → sympathetic pleural effusion, diaphragmatic paralysis. Direct compression of hepatic veins → hepatic venous outflow obstruction (Budd-Chiari) |
| ***Klebsiella liver abscess*** | ***Endogenous endophthalmitis; meningitis*** [4] | Klebsiella pneumoniae (hypermucoviscous strains with K1/K2 capsular serotypes) has unique ability to cause metastatic septic seeding even from a primary liver abscess → haematogenous spread to eyes (endophthalmitis → blindness if untreated) and CNS (meningitis). ***Urgent eye consult if symptoms of endophthalmitis*** [4] |
| ***Amoebic liver abscess*** | ***Rupture + peritonitis (2–7%); pleuropulmonary involvement (pleural effusion, bronchopleural fistula); rupture into pericardium (especially left lobe abscess, associated with very high mortality)*** [7] | Left lobe abscess sits adjacent to the pericardium → rupture through the diaphragm → amoebic pericarditis → tamponade → death. This is why left lobe amoebic abscesses warrant more aggressive drainage |
| ***Cholangitis*** | ***Septic shock → multi-organ failure (Reynold's pentad); hepatic abscess; cholangiohepatitis*** [13] | Biliary obstruction → stasis → bacterial overgrowth → ↑intraluminal pressure → cholangiovenous reflux (bacteria forced into bloodstream through disrupted bile duct epithelium) → bacteraemia → sepsis. 15% fail antibiotics and develop suppurative cholangitis |

#### 3. Urinary Tract Infections

***Complications of pyelonephritis, especially if obstruction, recent instrumentation, prior urinary tract abnormalities, DM, or immunocompromised*** [19]:
- ***Spread of infection: renal corticomedullary abscess, perinephric abscess*** [19] — infected material breaches renal capsule → perinephric fat → retroperitoneal abscess
- ***Urosepsis: systemic sepsis, shock, multi-organ failure*** [19] — Gram-negative bacteraemia (E. coli, Klebsiella) releases LPS → massive cytokine response → distributive shock
- ***Acute renal failure*** [19] — combination of sepsis-mediated AKI and obstructive uropathy if stones or other obstruction present

#### 4. CNS Infections

***Complications mainly occur in pyogenic and chronic meningitis*** [8]:

- ***Basal meningeal adhesions*** from incomplete resolution of inflammatory exudates:
  - ***Hydrocephalus → ↑ICP*** [8] — exudate blocks CSF drainage at arachnoid granulations (communicating) or at foramina (obstructive)
  - ***CN palsies: III, IV, VI commonest; VIII involvement tends to persist*** [8] — nerves pass through the inflamed basal cisterns
- ***Arteritis/thrombophlebitis → cerebral infarction*** [8] — inflammation of vessel walls (endarteritis) → luminal narrowing → thrombosis → ischaemic stroke
- ***Parenchymal damage*** [8]:
  - ***Neurological sequelae: intellectual impairment, mental retardation, cerebral palsy*** — especially in neonatal/infant meningitis
  - ***Seizures: 10% in acute bacterial meningitis, ~5% develop epilepsy*** [8]
- ***Spread of infection*** [8]:
  - ***Locally → cerebritis, cerebral abscess, subdural effusion/empyema***
  - ***Systemically → arthritis, IE***
- ***SIADH → hyponatraemia*** [8] — meningeal inflammation stimulates ADH release → water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia

#### 5. Cardiac Infections

***Complications of IE*** (from septic embolism and immune complex deposition) [9]:

| Category | Complications | Pathophysiology |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| ***Septic embolism*** | ***Stroke, brain abscess, cold limbs (peripheral embolism), splenic/renal/visceral infarcts, septic pulmonary emboli (right-sided IE → multiple cavitating lesions on CXR)*** [9] | Friable vegetations fragment → embolize to cerebral, splenic, renal, mesenteric or pulmonary vasculature. Size of vegetation correlates with embolic risk (> 10 mm = high risk, especially on anterior mitral valve leaflet) |
| ***Immune complex deposition*** | ***Glomerulonephritis (RBC casts, proteinuria), Osler nodes (tender nodules on finger pulps — immune complex vasculitis), Roth spots (retinal haemorrhages with white centres)*** [9] | Sustained antigenaemia → polyclonal B-cell activation → circulating immune complexes → deposit in glomeruli (type III hypersensitivity → proliferative GN) and small vessels (digital arteries → Osler nodes) |
| ***Valvular destruction*** | ***New/worsening regurgitation, paravalvular abscess (AV block on ECG), heart failure*** | Direct bacterial invasion and enzymatic destruction of valve tissue → leaflet perforation, chordal rupture. Abscess extends to conduction system → AV block. Severe regurgitation → acute volume overload → heart failure |

#### 6. Skin and Soft Tissue Infections

***Complications of cellulitis/erysipelas: bacteraemia, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome (TSS)*** [10]

- **Necrotising fasciitis** is the most feared complication: infection spreads along fascial planes with rapid necrosis → ***pain out of proportion to examination findings*** is the classic early clue. Surgical emergency — requires urgent debridement, not just antibiotics

#### 7. Post-Operative Fever Complications

***DVT/PE*** — the "Walking" complication [12]:
- ***First sign of DVT/PE may be unexplained tachycardia; 60–80% are clinically silent*** [12]
- ***D-dimer is NOT useful in the post-operative setting*** — elevated from surgery itself [12]
- Fatal PE accounts for ~5% of post-operative deaths and is largely preventable

***Anastomotic leak*** — becomes apparent 5–7 days postoperatively [39]:
- ***Clinical signs include pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent or purulent drainage*** [39]
- Management: fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, bowel rest, image-guided drainage, ± temporary faecal diversion or re-operation

---

### D. Complications of Treatment

These are iatrogenic complications that arise from the therapies used to manage fever and its causes:

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Paracetamol** | Hepatotoxicity (overdose) | CYP450 metabolizes paracetamol → toxic metabolite NAPQI → normally conjugated by glutathione. In overdose or liver disease → glutathione depletion → NAPQI accumulates → centrilobular hepatic necrosis |
| **NSAIDs** | GI bleeding, AKI, cardiovascular events | ↓COX-1 → ↓gastric mucosal PGE₂ → ↓mucus/bicarbonate secretion → erosions/ulcers. ↓Renal PGs → ↓afferent arteriolar dilation → ↓GFR → pre-renal AKI. ↓PGI₂ (vasodilator) without ↓TXA₂ → pro-thrombotic state |
| **Antibiotics** | C. difficile colitis, drug resistance, drug fever, allergic reactions | Broad-spectrum antibiotics disrupt normal gut flora → overgrowth of toxigenic C. difficile → toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin) → mucosal inflammation → pseudomembranous colitis. ***Easily missed cause of fever: C. diff colitis*** [12] |
| **Anti-TB drugs** | ***Hepatotoxicity*** (5.3–12% incidence); drug fever | Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide are all potentially hepatotoxic. ***Withhold treatment if ALT ≥ 3× ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 2× ULN*** [33]. Drug fever: ***exclude superinfection or worsening TB → suspend treatment and re-introduce drugs sequentially*** [33] |
| **Corticosteroids** (used in septic shock, TBM, adrenal crisis) | Immunosuppression, hyperglycaemia, adrenal suppression, GI bleeding | Steroids suppress virtually all arms of immunity → ↑risk of secondary and opportunistic infections. ↑Gluconeogenesis → hyperglycaemia. Prolonged use → HPA axis suppression → risk of Addisonian crisis on abrupt withdrawal |
| **IV fluids (aggressive resuscitation)** | Fluid overload, pulmonary oedema, abdominal compartment syndrome | Capillary leak in sepsis means much of the infused crystalloid extravasates into interstitium → tissue oedema. Excessive resuscitation → IAP > 20 mmHg → abdominal compartment syndrome → ↓venous return, ↓renal perfusion, ↓diaphragmatic excursion |
| **Vasopressors** | Peripheral ischaemia, arrhythmia, extravasation injury | High-dose catecholamines → excessive vasoconstriction → digital/limb ischaemia, mesenteric ischaemia. Extravasation of norepinephrine → local tissue necrosis (must be given via central line) |
| **Blood transfusion** | ***Febrile non-haemolytic transfusion reaction, acute haemolytic reaction, TRALI, bacterial septic reaction, allergic reaction*** [40] | FNHTR: cytokines accumulated in stored products + Ab vs donor leukocyte Ag. TRALI: donor Ab vs recipient WBCs → activation in lung microvasculature → ARDS-like picture [40]. Bacterial contamination: ***rapid onset chills/rigors, high fever > 2°C, hypotension, DIC*** [40] |

<Callout title="C. difficile — The Hidden Complication" type="error">
***C. diff colitis is an easily missed cause of post-operative and post-antibiotic fever*** [12]. Any patient who develops fever + diarrhoea after a course of antibiotics (especially clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, or broad-spectrum penicillins) should be tested for C. difficile toxin. Presentation ranges from mild diarrhoea to fulminant colitis with toxic megacolon, perforation, and death. Treatment: stop the offending antibiotic if possible; oral vancomycin 125 mg QDS × 10 days (first-line) or fidaxomicin 200 mg BD × 10 days.

### E. Long-Term Sequelae of Febrile Illness

| Sequela | Context | Mechanism |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Post-infectious fatigue** | EBV, COVID-19, influenza | Persistent immune activation, cytokine dysregulation, deconditioning. Up to 10% of EBV patients have fatigue lasting 6 months [17] |
| **Long COVID** | Post-COVID-19 | Physical, psychological and cognitive impairment after recovery — mechanism incompletely understood (persistent viral reservoirs, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, microthrombi) [38] |
| **Critical illness polyneuropathy/myopathy** | Post-sepsis, prolonged ICU stay | Axonal degeneration (CIP) and myosin loss (CIM) from systemic inflammation, immobility, corticosteroids, neuromuscular blocking agents. Recovery takes months |
| ***Post-stroke depression*** | Stroke as complication of fever (IE, meningitis, septic emboli) | ***Prevalence 29%***. Correlated with disability, anxiety, cognitive impairment, stroke severity [41] |
| **Hearing loss** | Post-meningitis (especially pneumococcal) | ***CN VIII involvement tends to persist*** [8] — sensorineural hearing loss from cochlear damage by inflammation/ischaemia. All children post-meningitis need audiometry |
| **Post-sepsis syndrome** | Post-ICU | Cognitive impairment, PTSD, chronic pain, recurrent infections, ↑cardiovascular risk. Affects up to 50% of sepsis survivors at 1 year |
