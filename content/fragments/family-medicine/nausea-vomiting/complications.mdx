## Complications of Nausea and Vomiting

Vomiting is not just a symptom to manage — it is a physiological insult that, when prolonged or severe, can itself cause serious morbidity and even mortality. Think of it this way: every episode of vomiting expels water, electrolytes, and hydrogen ions from the body, generates enormous intra-abdominal and intrathoracic pressure, and exposes structures to gastric acid in places they should never encounter it. The complications can be organised into **metabolic/fluid**, **mechanical/traumatic**, **nutritional**, and **secondary organ injury** categories.

---

### 1. Metabolic and Fluid Complications

These are the most common complications and the ones you must actively investigate and manage in every patient with significant or prolonged vomiting. The senior notes specifically list these as ***complications of vomiting*** requiring ***CBC for anaemia, leukocytosis; RFT for hydration status, electrolyte disturbance; ABG for metabolic alkalosis*** [32].

#### 1.1 Dehydration and Hypovolaemia

**Mechanism**: Each episode of vomiting expels gastric fluid (containing water, Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, H⁺). Concurrently, oral intake is reduced or impossible due to nausea. The result is progressive negative fluid balance.

**Clinical features**: Dry mucous membranes, ↓skin turgor, sunken eyes, tachycardia, postural hypotension, ↓urine output, ↑urine specific gravity.

**Why it matters**: Hypovolaemia → ↓cardiac output → ↓renal perfusion → **pre-renal acute kidney injury** (AKI). In bowel obstruction, the problem is compounded by ***fluid sequestration in bowel lumen*** ("third-space loss") [48] — fluid is trapped in the dilated bowel proximal to the obstruction and is functionally lost from the circulation even though it hasn't left the body.

> ***Dehydration and electrolyte loss in intestinal obstruction*** arises from: ***decreased oral intake, loss due to vomiting, defective intestinal absorption, fluid sequestration in bowel lumen, transudation of fluid into extracellular space and peritoneal cavity*** [48].

#### 1.2 Hypokalaemic Hypochloraemic Metabolic Alkalosis

This is the *signature* electrolyte disturbance of prolonged vomiting and is a favourite exam topic. Let's trace it step by step from first principles:

1. **Loss of HCl in vomitus**: Gastric parietal cells secrete H⁺ and Cl⁻ into the stomach lumen. Normally, when this acid reaches the duodenum, it stimulates pancreatic HCO₃⁻ secretion, neutralising the "alkaline tide" (the HCO₃⁻ that entered the blood when the parietal cell made HCl). When you vomit, H⁺ is lost *before* reaching the duodenum → the alkaline tide goes unopposed → **metabolic alkalosis**.

2. **Hypochloraemia**: Direct loss of Cl⁻ in gastric juice. This is critical because Cl⁻ depletion **maintains** the alkalosis — the kidney cannot excrete HCO₃⁻ efficiently without adequate Cl⁻ (the principal anion exchange partner in the collecting duct).

3. **Hypokalaemia**: Through three mechanisms:
   - Small direct K⁺ loss in vomitus (gastric K⁺ concentration is only ~5-10 mmol/L, so direct loss is modest)
   - **Renal K⁺ wasting** — hypovolaemia activates the RAAS → aldosterone drives Na⁺ reabsorption at the expense of K⁺ and H⁺ excretion in the collecting duct
   - **Transcellular shift** — alkalosis drives K⁺ into cells (H⁺ comes out of cells to buffer the alkalosis; K⁺ goes in to maintain electrical neutrality)

4. **Paradoxical aciduria**: Despite systemic alkalosis, the urine becomes acidic. Why? The kidneys are desperately reabsorbing Na⁺ (because the patient is hypovolaemic) and excreting H⁺ instead of K⁺ when K⁺ is severely depleted — perpetuating both the alkalosis and the hypokalaemia in a vicious cycle.

**Clinical significance**: Severe hypokalaemia (K⁺ < 2.5 mmol/L) → muscle weakness, paralytic ileus, cardiac arrhythmias (U waves on ECG, risk of torsades de pointes). Severe alkalosis (pH > 7.55) → ↓ionised calcium → tetany, seizures.

**Investigation**: ***RFT for hydration status, electrolyte disturbance; ABG for metabolic alkalosis*** [32].

**Management**: IV 0.9% NaCl + KCl (repletes volume, chloride, and potassium simultaneously).

> In the specific context of ***gastric outlet obstruction***: ***Risk of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities including hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis*** [49]. Management includes ***Normal saline and KCl is administered when indicated*** for ***prolonged vomiting leading to hyponatraemia, hypokalaemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis*** [50].

#### 1.3 Hyponatraemia

**Mechanism**: Dual hit — Na⁺ is lost in vomitus (gastric Na⁺ ~20–70 mmol/L), PLUS hypovolaemia triggers ADH release → water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia.

**Severity**: Usually mild (130–135 mmol/L) in uncomplicated vomiting, but can become moderate-severe in prolonged cases (GOO, hyperemesis gravidarum, bowel obstruction).

#### 1.4 Pre-Renal Acute Kidney Injury

**Mechanism**: Hypovolaemia → ↓renal perfusion → ↓GFR → ↑urea and creatinine. Classic pattern: urea rises disproportionately to creatinine (urea:creatinine ratio > 100:1) because urea is preferentially reabsorbed in the hypovolaemic, slow-flowing proximal tubule.

**Significance**: Usually rapidly reversible with volume resuscitation, but if unrecognised and prolonged, can progress to acute tubular necrosis (intrinsic renal disease).

#### 1.5 Hypoglycaemia and Starvation Ketosis

**Mechanism**: Prolonged vomiting → inability to eat → hepatic glycogen depletion (within 24–48h) → gluconeogenesis becomes the only glucose source → simultaneously, lipolysis generates ketone bodies for alternative fuel → **starvation ketoacidosis** (mild, usually pH > 7.30, low-normal glucose).

**Significance**: More common in children (lower glycogen reserves) and in hyperemesis gravidarum. Distinguish from DKA (where glucose is high, not low).

---

### 2. Mechanical and Traumatic Complications

The act of vomiting generates enormous forces — intra-abdominal pressures can exceed 200 mmHg during forceful retching. These mechanical forces can damage structures throughout the upper GI tract and beyond.

#### 2.1 Mallory–Weiss Tear

***Emetogenic injury, eg. Mallory-Weiss tears*** [32][51].

**What it is**: A longitudinal **mucosal** tear at the **gastroesophageal junction** (GEJ), typically on the gastric side (lesser curvature of the cardia).

**Mechanism**: Forceful retching → sudden ↑↑intra-abdominal pressure against a closed upper oesophageal sphincter → mechanical shearing force at the GEJ (which is the point of maximum stress because it transitions from the negative-pressure thorax to the positive-pressure abdomen) → mucosal tear.

**Clinical features**: Haematemesis (bright red blood or coffee-ground) following an episode of forceful vomiting. Classically described in alcoholics after a binge/vomiting episode, but can occur with any violent vomiting.

**Diagnosis**: OGD — reveals a longitudinal mucosal laceration at the GEJ.

**Prognosis**: 80–90% stop bleeding spontaneously; endoscopic haemostasis (clips, thermal coagulation) for persistent bleeding. Rarely requires angiographic embolisation or surgery.

#### 2.2 Boerhaave Syndrome (Spontaneous Oesophageal Perforation)

**What it is**: A **transmural** (full-thickness) rupture of the oesophagus, almost always on the left posterolateral distal oesophagus (the weakest point, where it lacks serosal covering).

**Mechanism**: Same as Mallory–Weiss but the force is greater and the tear extends through all layers (mucosa → submucosa → muscularis → adventitia) → gastric contents and air leak into the mediastinum → **mediastinitis** and **chemical pneumonitis**.

**Clinical features**: "Mackler's triad" — (1) forceful vomiting, (2) lower chest/epigastric pain, (3) subcutaneous emphysema. Also dyspnoea, fever, sepsis. **Hamman's sign**: mediastinal crunch (crackling sound synchronous with heartbeat on auscultation).

**Diagnosis**:
- CXR: pneumomediastinum, left-sided pleural effusion, subcutaneous emphysema
- Water-soluble contrast swallow (Gastrografin): demonstrates leak site
- CT thorax with oral contrast: most sensitive

**Prognosis**: Lethal if untreated (mortality > 90% if delayed > 24h). Requires urgent surgical repair ± drainage of mediastinum and pleura. Earlier presentation has better outcomes with endoscopic stenting or primary repair.

<Callout title="Mallory–Weiss vs Boerhaave — Know the Difference" type="error">

| Feature | Mallory–Weiss Tear | Boerhaave Syndrome |
|---|---|---|
| Depth | Mucosal only | Transmural (full-thickness) |
| Location | GEJ (usually gastric side) | Distal oesophagus (left posterolateral) |
| Presentation | Haematemesis | Chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, sepsis |
| Severity | Usually self-limiting | Surgical emergency; lethal if delayed |
| Key investigation | OGD | Contrast swallow / CT with oral contrast |
| Key complication | GI bleeding | Mediastinitis, sepsis, death |

Both are caused by forceful vomiting, but Boerhaave is far more dangerous because gastric contents enter the mediastinum. Mallory–Weiss bleeds; Boerhaave perforates.
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Subconjunctival Haemorrhage

**Mechanism**: Forceful retching → sudden ↑venous pressure in the head and neck (Valsalva effect) → rupture of small conjunctival capillaries → blood spreads under the bulbar conjunctiva.

**Clinical significance**: Alarming in appearance but benign and self-limiting (resolves in 1–3 weeks). No treatment needed. Important to reassure the patient.

#### 2.4 Petechial Haemorrhages (Facial)

**Mechanism**: Same Valsalva mechanism as subconjunctival haemorrhage → venous congestion in the head → rupture of dermal capillaries, particularly in the periorbital region and face.

**Clinical significance**: Can be a clinical clue to forceful/prolonged vomiting. In children, consider non-accidental injury (NAI) as an alternative cause of facial petechiae.

#### 2.5 Pneumomediastinum (Without Boerhaave)

**Mechanism**: Forceful retching can cause alveolar rupture (similar mechanism to Valsalva) → air tracks along perivascular sheaths into the mediastinum → pneumomediastinum.

**Clinical significance**: Usually self-limiting if the oesophagus is intact; but must exclude Boerhaave syndrome with a contrast study.

### 3. Aspiration-Related Complications

#### 3.1 Aspiration Pneumonia / Aspiration Pneumonitis

**Mechanism**: Vomitus enters the trachea and lower airways. Two distinct processes:

1. **Aspiration pneumonitis** (Mendelson syndrome): Chemical injury from gastric acid (pH < 2.5) → acute inflammatory response in bronchial and alveolar epithelium → diffuse alveolar damage → pulmonary oedema, hypoxia. Onset is rapid (within hours). Sterile initially.

2. **Aspiration pneumonia**: Bacterial infection from aspiration of oropharyngeal flora and gastric contents → typically anaerobic and gram-negative organisms → lobar or segmental pneumonia, often in dependent lung segments (right lower lobe if supine, posterior segments if recumbent).

**Risk factors** [52]: ***Depressed sensorium (eg. stroke, drug intoxication), increased gastro-oesophageal reflux, overfeeding*** [52]. Also: absent gag reflex, supine positioning, ↓consciousness (from any cause including intoxication, anaesthesia, seizures), NGT feeding errors.

**Clinical features**: Cough, fever, dyspnoea, crackles on auscultation, hypoxia. CXR may show consolidation in dependent segments ± air bronchograms.

**Prevention**:
- Lateral positioning of vomiting patients with ↓consciousness
- NGT decompression in bowel obstruction/gastroparesis before anaesthesia
- Elevate head of bed to 30–45° during enteral feeding [52]
- Pre-operative fasting ("nil by mouth" rules)

> ***Aspiration pneumonia*** is listed as a complication of ***intestinal atresia, gastric outlet obstruction, and enteral nutrition*** across multiple sources [49][52][53].

#### 3.2 Airway Obstruction

**Mechanism**: Large food particles or copious vomitus can physically occlude the larynx or trachea → acute upper airway obstruction → asphyxiation.

**Risk factors**: Reduced consciousness, absent gag reflex, supine position, copious vomiting (e.g. bowel obstruction, massive upper GI bleed).

**Management**: Emergency suctioning, lateral positioning, basic airway manoeuvres, intubation if needed.

---

### 4. Nutritional Complications

Prolonged or recurrent vomiting prevents adequate nutritional intake and can lead to specific deficiency syndromes:

#### 4.1 Wernicke Encephalopathy (Thiamine / Vitamin B1 Deficiency)

**Mechanism**: Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water-soluble vitamin with limited body stores (depleted within 2–3 weeks of inadequate intake). Vomiting → ↓oral intake → rapid depletion. Thiamine is an essential cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase (links glycolysis to TCA cycle) and transketolase (pentose phosphate pathway).

**Clinical triad**: Confusion, ophthalmoplegia (CN III/VI palsies, nystagmus), ataxia. In reality, the complete triad is present in only ~30% of cases — have a low threshold for suspicion.

**At-risk populations**: Hyperemesis gravidarum, chronic alcoholism, prolonged vomiting of any cause, eating disorders, refeeding.

**Prevention**: IV thiamine 100mg BEFORE any dextrose-containing fluids.

**Why this is dangerous**: If you give glucose (IV dextrose) to a thiamine-depleted patient, you accelerate glucose metabolism without the cofactor needed to process pyruvate → lactate accumulates → further neuronal damage. This is why the teaching is: **"Thiamine before dextrose, ALWAYS."**

#### 4.2 Other Nutritional Deficiencies

| Deficiency | Mechanism in Vomiting | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Iron** | ↓Oral intake + occult GI blood loss (Mallory–Weiss, erosive gastritis) | Iron deficiency anaemia |
| **Folate** | ↓Oral intake (folate stores deplete in weeks) | Megaloblastic anaemia |
| **Vitamin K** | ↓Oral intake + ↓fat-soluble vitamin absorption if concurrent bile salt depletion | Coagulopathy (↑PT/INR) |
| **Total caloric intake** | Chronic vomiting → negative energy balance | Weight loss, muscle wasting, cachexia |
| **Protein** | ↓Intake → negative nitrogen balance | Hypoalbuminaemia → oedema; poor wound healing; immunodeficiency |

---

### 5. Dental and Oropharyngeal Complications

#### 5.1 Dental Erosion (Perimolysis)

**Mechanism**: Gastric acid (pH ~1–2) repeatedly contacts dental enamel during vomiting → chemical dissolution of enamel. The pattern is characteristic: **lingual and palatal surfaces of the upper incisors and molars** are affected first (because vomitus flows over these surfaces as it exits the mouth).

**Clinical significance**: Pathognomonic finding in **bulimia nervosa** (chronic self-induced vomiting). Also occurs in chronic vomiting of any cause (GERD, gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome).

**Dental consequences**: Sensitivity to hot/cold/sweet; yellowing of teeth (dentin becomes visible); ↑caries risk; eventually tooth loss.

#### 5.2 Parotid Gland Enlargement (Sialoadenosis)

**Mechanism**: Chronic stimulation of the parotid glands by repeated vomiting → hypertrophy and hyperplasia of acinar cells → bilateral, painless parotid enlargement.

**Clinical significance**: Characteristic finding in bulimia nervosa. Takes weeks to months of repeated vomiting to develop.

#### 5.3 Pharyngeal and Oesophageal Mucosal Injury

**Mechanism**: Repeated exposure to gastric acid → chemical inflammation of pharyngeal and oesophageal mucosa → sore throat, hoarseness, odynophagia. Can progress to oesophagitis and stricture formation if chronic.

---

### 6. Cardiac Complications

#### 6.1 Cardiac Arrhythmias

**Mechanism**: Electrolyte derangements from vomiting — particularly **hypokalaemia** and **hypomagnesaemia** — directly affect cardiac myocyte electrophysiology:

- Hypokalaemia → hyperpolarisation of resting membrane potential → ↑duration of action potential → **prolonged QT interval** → risk of **torsades de pointes** (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) and **ventricular fibrillation**
- ECG changes: flattened T waves → ST depression → prominent U waves → QT prolongation → arrhythmias
- Hypomagnesaemia (often co-exists with hypokalaemia) further ↑arrhythmia risk and makes hypokalaemia refractory to K⁺ replacement (must correct Mg²⁺ first)

**Clinical significance**: This is the most dangerous immediate complication in eating disorders (bulimia, anorexia with purging) and in severe prolonged vomiting of any cause. Sudden cardiac death can occur.

---

### 7. Psychological and Behavioural Complications

#### 7.1 Aversion to Eating

**Mechanism**: Repeated association of eating with subsequent nausea/vomiting → conditioned food aversion (classical conditioning). The patient subconsciously avoids eating to avoid the unpleasant consequence.

**Clinical significance**: Leads to further weight loss, malnutrition, and perpetuates the cycle. Particularly problematic in gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome, and functional nausea.

#### 7.2 Anxiety and Depression

**Mechanism**: Chronic N/V → reduced quality of life, inability to work, social isolation, fear of vomiting in public (emetophobia), disrupted sleep → secondary anxiety and depression.

#### 7.3 Healthcare Overutilisation

Chronic unexplained N/V can lead to repeated ED visits, hospitalisations, invasive investigations, and opioid prescription (for associated pain), with risk of iatrogenic harm.

### 8. Complications Summary Table

| Category | Complication | Mechanism | Key Investigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fluid/Metabolic** | Dehydration + hypovolaemia | Fluid loss in vomitus + ↓intake | Clinical assessment, RFT [32] |
| | Hypokalaemic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis | Loss of HCl → unopposed alkaline tide; Cl⁻ depletion maintains alkalosis; renal K⁺ wasting | Electrolytes, ABG [32] |
| | Pre-renal AKI | Hypovolaemia → ↓renal perfusion | Urea:Cr ratio, urine Na⁺ |
| | Hyponatraemia | Na⁺ loss + ADH-mediated water retention | Serum Na⁺, urine/serum osmolality |
| **Mechanical** | ***Mallory–Weiss tear*** [32][51] | Forceful retching → mucosal shear at GEJ | OGD |
| | Boerhaave syndrome | Transmural oesophageal rupture → mediastinitis | Contrast swallow, CT thorax |
| | Subconjunctival haemorrhage | ↑Venous pressure → capillary rupture | Clinical |
| **Aspiration** | ***Aspiration pneumonia*** [49][52][53] | Vomitus enters lower airways → chemical + bacterial pneumonia | CXR, sputum culture |
| | Airway obstruction | Food particles occlude airway | Clinical emergency |
| **Nutritional** | Wernicke encephalopathy | Thiamine depletion → impaired glucose metabolism in brain | Clinical; serum thiamine; MRI (mammillary body enhancement) |
| | Malnutrition / weight loss | Chronic ↓caloric intake | Albumin, pre-albumin, BMI |
| **Dental/Oral** | Dental erosion (perimolysis) | Acid damage to enamel | Dental examination |
| | Parotid enlargement | Chronic salivary gland stimulation → hypertrophy | Clinical |
| **Cardiac** | Arrhythmias | Hypokalaemia / hypomagnesaemia → QT prolongation → torsades | ECG, electrolytes |
| **Psychological** | Food aversion, anxiety, depression | Conditioned response; chronic suffering | Psychiatric assessment |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Nausea and Vomiting">

**Metabolic**: The hallmark is **hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis**. Investigate with electrolytes + ABG. Treat with IV NS + KCl. Always check and correct Mg²⁺ alongside K⁺. Pre-renal AKI from hypovolaemia is common and reversible with fluids.

**Mechanical**: **Mallory–Weiss tear** (mucosal, usually self-limiting → haematemesis) vs **Boerhaave syndrome** (transmural, surgical emergency → mediastinitis, sepsis, death). Both caused by forceful retching; key distinction is depth of injury and consequence.

**Aspiration**: Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis is a major risk, especially in reduced consciousness, bowel obstruction, and enteral feeding. Prevention: lateral positioning, NGT decompression, head elevation, pre-operative fasting.

**Nutritional**: **Wernicke encephalopathy** — always give **thiamine before dextrose** in prolonged vomiting, alcoholism, or hyperemesis gravidarum.

**Cardiac**: Hypokalaemia → QT prolongation → torsades de pointes → cardiac arrest. This is the leading cause of death in severe purging behaviours (bulimia, anorexia).

**Dental**: Perimolysis (lingual enamel erosion) is pathognomonic for chronic vomiting/bulimia.

Normally the alkaline tide (HCO3- entering blood when parietal cells secrete H+) is offset by pancreatic HCO3- secretion stimulated by duodenal acid. Vomiting removes H+ before it reaches duodenum so alkaline tide is unopposed. Cl- depletion MAINTAINS alkalosis because the kidney needs Cl- to exchange for HCO3- excretion in the collecting duct. Hypovolaemia activates RAAS causing secondary hyperaldosteronism which drives Na+ reabsorption at the expense of K+ and H+ secretion in the collecting duct. This causes renal K+ wasting (hypokalaemia) and H+ excretion (paradoxical aciduria - acidic urine despite systemic alkalosis). Alkalosis also shifts K+ into cells worsening hypokalaemia."

Prolonged vomiting depletes thiamine stores. Giving IV dextrose increases glucose metabolism and demand for these thiamine-dependent enzymes. Without thiamine, pyruvate cannot be processed and accumulates as lactate, causing further neuronal damage. This precipitates or worsens Wernicke encephalopathy (confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia).

The ECG changes (flattened T waves, U waves, prolonged QT) are classic for hypokalaemia. The dangerous arrhythmia is torsades de pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest.
