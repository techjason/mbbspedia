## Differential Diagnosis of Dyspepsia

The entire point of evaluating dyspepsia is **differential diagnosis** — because dyspepsia is a symptom complex, not a disease. Your job at the bedside is to sort through the differentials systematically, pick out the dangerous ones early, and arrive at the right diagnosis. Let's think about this like a clinician on a ward round.

### 1. Framework for Thinking About the Differential

There are two complementary ways to organise the differential:

1. **By frequency and danger** — Murtagh's Diagnostic Strategy (probability → serious → pitfalls → rarities → masquerades → psychosocial) [1]
2. **By organ system** — GI organic → Non-GI organic → Functional [2][3]

Both are useful. Murtagh's framework is excellent for the clinical reasoning stations (OSCE); the organ-system approach is more systematic for written exams. We will use **both** below.

### 2. Murtagh's Diagnostic Strategy for Dyspepsia [1]

This is a **must-know** framework for clinical exams — it forces you to think about common things first while never forgetting the dangerous ones.

| Category | Differentials | Why It's Here |
|---|---|---|
| ***Probability diagnosis*** | ***Irritable upper GIT (functional dyspepsia)*** | 60–75% of all dyspepsia — by far the commonest cause [3] |
| | ***Gastro-oesophageal reflux*** | Very common; often overlaps with dyspepsia in Chinese populations [2] |
| | ***Gastritis*** | Mucosal inflammation (HP, alcohol, NSAIDs, stress) without ulceration — self-limiting |
| | ***Oesophageal motility disorder (dysmotility)*** | e.g. achalasia, diffuse oesophageal spasm — can present with epigastric discomfort + dysphagia |
| ***Serious disorders not to be missed*** | ***Cancer: stomach, pancreas, oesophagus*** | Must be excluded in any patient with alarm features. ***Triple loss of appetite, weight and colour is a feature of cancer of the stomach*** [1]. |
| | ***Cardiovascular: ischaemic heart disease, congestive cardiac failure*** | ***In particular, care should be taken to consider and perhaps exclude ischaemic heart disease*** [1]. Inferior MI shares T5–T9 afferents with the stomach → referred epigastric pain. CCF → hepatic congestion → RUQ/epigastric discomfort. |
| | ***Pancreatitis*** | Acute or chronic — epigastric pain radiating to back, worsened by eating |
| | ***Peptic ulcer (PU)*** | Serious because of complications: bleeding, perforation, GOO. ***Epigastric pain aggravated by any food and relieved by antacids indicates chronic gastric ulcer. Pain before meals relieved by food indicates chronic duodenal ulcer.*** [1] |
| ***Pitfalls (often missed)*** | ***Myocardial ischaemia*** | The classic "missed diagnosis" — elderly patient with epigastric pain put down to "gastritis" but actually having an inferior STEMI |
| | ***Food allergy (e.g. lactose intolerance)*** | Undigested lactose → bacterial fermentation → gas, bloating, cramping. Easy to miss if you don't ask about dairy |
| | ***Pregnancy (early)*** | hCG → CTZ stimulation → nausea; progesterone → ↓ LES tone + slowed motility. Always check β-hCG in reproductive-age women! |
| | ***Biliary motility disorder*** | Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction — episodic biliary-type pain with normal imaging |
| | ***Other gallbladder disease*** | Cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis — post-prandial RUQ/epigastric pain |
| | ***Post vagotomy*** | Disrupted gastric motility → dumping syndrome, bile reflux gastropathy |
| | ***Duodenitis*** | Inflammation without frank ulceration — often H. pylori or NSAID-related |
| ***Rarities*** | ***Hyperparathyroidism*** | ↑ Ca²⁺ → ↑ gastrin secretion → ↑ acid production; also impairs GI smooth muscle motility |
| | ***Mesenteric ischaemia*** | "Intestinal angina" — post-prandial pain due to inadequate splanchnic blood flow in setting of atherosclerotic disease (coeliac/SMA stenosis) |
| | ***Zollinger–Ellison syndrome*** | Gastrinoma → massive acid hypersecretion → multiple/atypical ulcers, diarrhoea, PPI-resistant symptoms [7] |
| | ***Kidney failure*** | Uraemic toxins → direct mucosal damage; ↑ gastrin (reduced renal clearance) |
| | ***Scleroderma*** | Fibrosis of GI smooth muscle → oesophageal dysmotility, gastroparesis, GERD |
| ***Masquerades checklist*** | ***Depression*** | Somatic presentation of depression → vague epigastric discomfort, LOA |
| | ***Diabetes (rarely)*** | Autonomic neuropathy → gastroparesis → postprandial fullness, nausea, early satiety |
| | ***Drugs, esp. NSAIDs, aspirin*** | ***Drug history and past history is important, especially NSAID use*** [1]. Direct mucosal injury + COX-1 inhibition → ↓ PGE₂ → ↓ mucosal protection |
| ***"Is the patient trying to tell me something?"*** | ***Anxiety and stress are common associations of which patients are often unaware. Consider irritable bowel syndrome.*** [1] | Brain–gut axis: psychological distress → altered visceral perception, abnormal motility. IBS overlaps significantly with FD, especially in Chinese [2]. |

<Callout title="The Pitfall of Pitfalls" type="error">
***Myocardial ischaemia*** is the most dangerous diagnosis to miss. An inferior MI can present purely as epigastric pain (sometimes with nausea and diaphoresis but NO chest pain). In any patient > 50y with risk factors for coronary artery disease presenting with acute epigastric discomfort — get an ECG before reaching for the endoscopy referral form. The shared T5–T9 spinal innervation between the heart and the stomach makes this referral pattern neuroanatomically inevitable [1][9].

### 3. Systematic Organ-System Differential Diagnosis

Now let's organise the same differentials by mechanism and organ system, which is more useful when you need to be comprehensive.

#### 3A. Gastrointestinal Causes (Organic)

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Peptic ulcer disease** | ***Epigastric pain aggravated by food*** (GU) or ***relieved by food*** (DU) [1]; periodicity; night pain; NSAID/HP history; GI bleeding | Mucosal defect extending to muscularis mucosae — acid + pepsin eroding an area where protective mechanisms have failed (HP infection disrupts mucus layer; NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 → ↓ PGE₂) [3][6] |
| **GERD** | ***Heartburn + regurgitation*** — posturally aggravated, worse lying down/bending [2][5]; water brash; chronic cough; NCCP | Incompetent LES → reflux of acid/pepsin/bile into oesophageal squamous epithelium (which lacks the protective mucus-bicarbonate barrier of gastric columnar epithelium) → mucosal inflammation [5] |
| **Gastritis / Duodenitis** | Often indistinguishable from PUD clinically; diagnosed on OGD | Mucosal inflammation without ulcer crater — can be HP-related, chemical (alcohol, bile reflux, NSAIDs), or autoimmune (corpus gastritis with pernicious anaemia) |
| **Gastric cancer** | ***Triple loss of appetite, weight and colour*** [1]; progressive dysphagia (cardia tumour); GOO (distal tumour); early satiety (linitis plastica); palpable mass; Virchow's node [8] | Adenocarcinoma (90%) — intestinal type arises through Correa cascade (HP → chronic atrophic gastritis → intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma); diffuse type (E-cadherin mutation) infiltrates transmurally [8] |
| **Oesophageal cancer** | Progressive dysphagia (solids → liquids), weight loss, odynophagia | Squamous cell CA (upper/middle oesophagus — smoking, alcohol) or adenocarcinoma (lower oesophagus / GOJ — Barrett's oesophagus from chronic GERD) |
| **Pancreatic cancer** | Epigastric pain radiating to back, painless obstructive jaundice (head), new-onset DM, weight loss, Courvoisier sign | Ductal adenocarcinoma (90%) — head tumours obstruct CBD → conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia; body/tail tumours invade coeliac plexus → severe back pain |
| ***Biliary pain*** [2] | ***Episodic constant NON-colicky intense dull pain in RUQ or epigastrium ± radiation to back or scapula; diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting; NOT increased by movement; can be associated with post-prandial discomfort*** [2] | Gallbladder distension against obstructing stone → visceral pain. Fatty meal → CCK release → GB contraction against stone → pain. ***Biliary colic can be associated with post-prandial pain, as eating a fatty meal is a common trigger for GB contraction*** [2]. |
| ***Chronic pancreatitis*** [2][3] | Epigastric pain radiating to back, steatorrhoea, DM (endocrine insufficiency), weight loss; history of alcohol or recurrent acute pancreatitis | Chronic inflammatory destruction of pancreatic parenchyma → fibrosis → loss of exocrine (lipase, amylase) and endocrine (insulin) function |
| ***Infiltrative gastric diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease)*** [2] | Other Crohn's features (mouth ulcers, perianal disease, skip lesions); granulomatous inflammation on biopsy | Transmural inflammation → gastric/duodenal stricture, fistula, ulceration |
| ***Coeliac disease*** [2] | Diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, IDA, dermatitis herpetiformis, bloating; often vague upper abdominal discomfort | Immune-mediated villous atrophy of small bowel (anti-tTG antibodies) → malabsorption of Fe, folate, Ca, fat-soluble vitamins |
| ***Intestinal parasitic infestation*** [2] | Travel history, eosinophilia, diarrhoea | Direct mucosal invasion/irritation by parasites (e.g. Giardia, Strongyloides) |
| ***Bowel ischaemia due to coeliac artery compression*** [2] | Post-prandial pain ("intestinal angina"), weight loss (food fear), abdominal bruit | Median arcuate ligament syndrome — extrinsic compression of coeliac artery → inadequate splanchnic blood flow when demand increases post-prandially |
| ***Other abdominal cancers (HCC, HBP malignancies)*** [2] | Hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites; HBV/HCV history (HCC); weight loss | Mass effect, capsular stretching of liver, biliary obstruction |
| **Gastroparesis** | Postprandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety; DM history | Impaired gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction — vagal neuropathy (DM), drugs (GLP-1 agonists, CCB), post-surgical [4] |
| **Gastric outlet obstruction** | Projectile non-bilious vomiting, succussion splash, weight loss | **Malignant (80%) until proven otherwise** — gastric CA most common cause; benign causes include PUD-related pyloric stenosis [4] |
| **Oesophageal motility disorder** | Dysphagia to solids AND liquids simultaneously (unlike mechanical obstruction which is solids first), chest pain, regurgitation of undigested food | Achalasia: failure of LES relaxation + absent oesophageal peristalsis (loss of inhibitory neurons in myenteric plexus). Diffuse oesophageal spasm: uncoordinated contractions. |

#### 3B. Non-Gastrointestinal Causes

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Drug-induced dyspepsia*** [1][2] | Temporal relationship to drug use; ***NSAIDs, steroids, oral antibiotics, iron, digoxin, metronidazole, alendronate, slow K*** [2] | Direct mucosal irritation (iron, alendronate, KCl) or systemic COX inhibition (NSAIDs → ↓ PGE₂). Steroids ↓ epithelial cell turnover. Digoxin stimulates CTZ → nausea. |
| ***Coronary artery disease (basal myocardial ischaemia)*** [1][2] | Exertional, CVD risk factors, associated diaphoresis/dyspnoea; may be relieved by GTN | Inferior wall ischaemia → cardiac afferents travel via T5–T9 → converge on same dorsal horn neurons as gastric afferents → brain misinterprets origin as epigastric [9] |
| ***CCF*** [1] | Peripheral oedema, ↑ JVP, orthopnoea, hepatomegaly | Right heart failure → ↑ hepatic venous pressure → hepatic congestion → capsular distension → RUQ/epigastric pain; also gut wall oedema → dysmotility |
| ***Electrolyte disturbances (hyperCa, hyperK)*** [2][3] | Polyuria, polydipsia (hyperCa); weakness, ECG changes (hyperK) | HyperCa → ↑ gastrin → ↑ acid; ↓ GI smooth muscle contractility → constipation, nausea. HyperK → GI smooth muscle dysfunction |
| ***Thyroid / parathyroid diseases*** [2] | Thyrotoxic features (tremor, weight loss, tachycardia) or hyperparathyroid features (stones, bones, moans, groans) | Hyperthyroidism → ↑ GI motility → discomfort. ***Hyperparathyroidism*** [1] → hypercalcaemia → mechanisms as above |
| ***Chronic renal failure*** [2] | Elevated creatinine, uraemic symptoms (nausea, anorexia, pruritis, metallic taste) | Uraemic toxins → direct gastric mucosal damage (uraemic gastropathy); ↓ renal clearance of gastrin → hypergastrinaemia |
| ***Abdominal wall pain*** [2] | ***Carnett sign: ↑ local tenderness during muscle tensing → indicates abdominal wall origin*** [2] | Nerve entrapment (anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome — ACNES), muscle strain, hernia. The positive Carnett sign differentiates wall from visceral pain because tensing the rectus sheath compresses the trapped nerve/injured muscle |
| ***Depression*** [1] | Low mood, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, fatigue; somatic symptoms without organic cause | Brain–gut axis: depression → altered serotonin signalling in both CNS and enteric nervous system → abnormal visceral perception + dysmotility |
| ***Diabetes*** [1] | Known DM, signs of peripheral/autonomic neuropathy | Diabetic autonomic neuropathy → vagal dysfunction → gastroparesis |
| ***Early pregnancy*** [1] | Reproductive-age woman, amenorrhoea, breast tenderness | hCG stimulates chemoreceptor trigger zone → nausea/vomiting; progesterone → relaxes LES (reflux) + slows gastric emptying |

#### 3C. Functional Cause

| Differential | Key Features | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Functional dyspepsia*** [2][3] | Diagnosis of exclusion — ***dyspepsia in the absence of detectable organic diseases*** [2]. Two subtypes: PDS (postprandial fullness, early satiation) and EPS (epigastric pain/burning) | Multifactorial: impaired gastric accommodation, visceral hypersensitivity, altered microbiome, duodenal micro-inflammation, psychological factors [2] |
| **IBS overlap** | Abdominal pain related to defecation (distinguishing feature from dyspepsia); altered bowel habits | ***Considerable overlap with GERD and IBS in Chinese*** [2]. IBS and FD share pathophysiological mechanisms (visceral hypersensitivity, brain–gut axis dysfunction) and commonly coexist |

<Callout title="FD vs IBS: The Key Distinguishing Feature" type="error">
***Symptoms that are relieved by evacuation of feces or gas should generally NOT be considered as part of dyspepsia*** [3]. If abdominal pain is characteristically associated with defecation → think **IBS**. If centred in the epigastrium and related to meals or fasting but NOT to bowel movements → think **FD**. In practice, ~30–50% of FD patients also meet criteria for IBS, so the overlap is huge — but the distinction matters for classification and targeted treatment.

### 4. Narrowing the Differential: Clinical Discriminators

The following table summarises how the history and examination help you **move from the broad differential list to the likely diagnosis**. This is the clinical reasoning that examiners want to see.

| Clinical Feature | Points Towards | Points Away From |
|---|---|---|
| ***Epigastric pain aggravated by food, relieved by antacids*** [1] | Gastric ulcer | DU (food relieves DU) |
| ***Pain before meals, relieved by food*** [1] | Duodenal ulcer | GU |
| ***Heartburn + regurgitation*** [2] | GERD | FD (heartburn is NOT a dyspeptic symptom per Rome IV) |
| Pain related to defecation / passage of flatus | IBS | Dyspepsia |
| ***Episodic constant pain, RUQ/epigastric, radiation to scapula, NOT increased by movement*** [2] | Biliary pain | PUD, GERD |
| ***Triple loss of appetite, weight and colour*** [1] | Gastric cancer | FD (no weight loss / anaemia in FD) |
| Exertional pain, CVD risk factors, diaphoresis | Myocardial ischaemia / angina | GI cause |
| Temporal relationship with NSAID use | Drug-induced / PUD | FD |
| ***Positive Carnett sign*** [2] | Abdominal wall pain | Visceral cause |
| Young woman, amenorrhoea, nausea | Early pregnancy | — |
| Multiple atypical ulcers, diarrhoea, PPI-resistant | ***Zollinger–Ellison syndrome*** [1][7] | Simple PUD |
| Known DM + postprandial fullness/vomiting | Gastroparesis | Mechanical GOO |

### 6. Special Differential Considerations for Hong Kong

Given the local epidemiology in Hong Kong, certain differentials carry greater weight compared to Western settings [2][5]:

- ***H. pylori*-related PUD**: HP prevalence ~30–40% in HK adults (declining but still significant) — always test for HP
- **Gastric cancer**: Higher incidence in East Asia than the West → lower threshold for OGD (***age > 40*** rather than > 55 used in some Western guidelines) [2]
- **Hepatocellular carcinoma**: HBV carrier rate ~8% in HK → HCC is a relevant differential for epigastric discomfort with hepatomegaly/weight loss
- **GERD overlap**: ***GERD incidence rising in HK*** [5], and Asian patients often present ***atypically*** (more NCCP, more "acid feeling in stomach" rather than classic heartburn) [5] → may be misclassified as dyspepsia
- **Functional dyspepsia**: ***Prevalence 10–20% among Chinese*** [2] with ***considerable overlap with GERD and IBS*** [2]

---

### 7. When to Suspect a Rare but Important Differential

| Clinical Clue | Suspect | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Recurrent ulcers despite adequate HP eradication and NSAID cessation; ulcers in unusual locations (D2, jejunum); diarrhoea + weight loss | ***Zollinger-Ellison syndrome*** [7] | ***Gastrinoma → 4–6× gastric acid output; multiple ulcers at atypical positions, often complicated; PPI-resistant*** [7]. Diagnosed by fasting serum gastrin > 10× ULN while pH < 2 [7]. |
| Epigastric pain after eating in elderly with known atherosclerotic disease, weight loss ("food fear"), abdominal bruit | ***Mesenteric ischaemia*** [1] | Coeliac/SMA stenosis → inadequate post-prandial splanchnic blood flow → "intestinal angina" |
| "Stones, bones, moans, groans" + dyspepsia | ***Hyperparathyroidism*** [1] | ↑ PTH → ↑ Ca²⁺ → ↑ gastrin → ↑ acid; ↓ GI motility |
| Raynaud's, skin tightening, dysphagia + reflux | ***Scleroderma*** [1] | Fibrosis of oesophageal/gastric smooth muscle → dysmotility, GERD, gastroparesis |
| Known MEN1 + recurrent PUD | ZES (gastrinoma) | ***20–30% of gastrinomas are associated with MEN1*** [7] |

<Callout title="High Yield Exam Pearl">
When the question gives you a patient with **recurrent peptic ulcers despite treatment**, **ulcers at unusual locations** (beyond D1), or **diarrhoea with PUD** — think ***Zollinger-Ellison syndrome*** [1][7]. When it gives you **epigastric pain + CVD risk factors + diaphoresis** — do NOT assume it's GI; get an ***ECG to exclude myocardial ischaemia*** [1][9].
</Callout>

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Framework**: Use Murtagh's Diagnostic Strategy — probability (FD, GERD, gastritis) → serious (cancer, IHD, CCF, PUD, pancreatitis) → pitfalls (MI, pregnancy, biliary, food allergy) → rarities (ZES, hyperparathyroidism, mesenteric ischaemia, scleroderma, CKD) → masquerades (depression, DM, drugs) → psychosocial (anxiety/IBS).

**Most common cause**: Functional dyspepsia (60–75%), but this is a diagnosis of exclusion.

**Most dangerous to miss**: Myocardial ischaemia (shared T5–T9 innervation), gastric/pancreatic/oesophageal cancer.

**Key discriminators**: Food–pain relationship (GU vs DU), heartburn/regurgitation (GERD), pain with defecation (IBS not dyspepsia), alarm features (cancer), drug history (NSAID), Carnett sign (abdominal wall), biliary pattern (constant, radiation to scapula).

**HK-specific**: Lower OGD age threshold (> 40), high HP prevalence, rising GERD, HBV-related HCC, FD-IBS-GERD overlap in Chinese.

**ZES clues**: Atypical ulcer location, PPI-resistant, multiple ulcers, diarrhoea, fasting gastrin > 10× ULN with pH < 2.
