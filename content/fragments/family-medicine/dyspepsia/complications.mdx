## Complications of Dyspepsia and Its Underlying Causes

Dyspepsia itself is a symptom complex — it does not cause complications per se. The complications arise from the **underlying organic conditions** that present as dyspepsia, from the **treatments** we use, and from the **functional condition** when it becomes chronic and refractory. Let's go through each systematically.

---

### 1. Complications of Peptic Ulcer Disease

PUD is the most common organic cause of dyspepsia with serious complications. The classic teaching is ***'bleed', 'burst', 'block' and 'burrow'*** — haemorrhage, perforation, gastric outlet obstruction, and penetration/fistulisation [6].

#### 1A. Haemorrhage (Bleeding) — "Bleed"

This is the ***leading cause of death from peptic ulcer*** [14].

**Pathophysiology**: The ulcer erodes through the mucosa into the submucosa and muscularis, reaching blood vessels. A posterior duodenal ulcer classically erodes into the **gastroduodenal artery** (GDA — a branch of the common hepatic artery running behind D1). A lesser curvature gastric ulcer can erode into the **left gastric artery**. When the vessel wall is breached, arterial (or venous) haemorrhage occurs into the GI lumen.

**Clinical presentation** [3]:
- ***Haematemesis***: vomiting of red blood or coffee-ground material — the "coffee ground" appearance is blood that has been partially digested by gastric acid (acid converts haemoglobin to acid haematin, which is dark/brown)
- ***Melaena***: black, tarry stools — blood that has transited through the entire GI tract; the dark colour comes from bacterial degradation of haemoglobin in the colon (requires ≥ 50–100 mL of blood and transit time of ≥ 14 hours)
- ***Haematochezia***: fresh red blood per rectum — occurs in massive upper GI bleeding when transit is too rapid for bacterial degradation
- ***Postural hypotension, tachycardia, shock*** — signs of hypovolaemia
- ***Iron-deficiency anaemia*** — from chronic occult bleeding (the patient may not notice visible blood loss)

**Endoscopic assessment — Forrest Classification** [15]:

This classification grades the **endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage (ESRH)** and predicts the risk of rebleeding, which determines management:

| Forrest Class | Description | Risk of Rebleeding (if untreated) | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ia** | Active spurting | ~100% | ***Endoscopic therapy*** + ***IV PPI bolus + infusion × 72h*** [15] |
| **Ib** | Active oozing | 10–27% | As above |
| **IIa** | Non-bleeding visible vessel | 50% | As above |
| **IIb** | Non-bleeding adherent clot | 30–35% | As above (remove clot by vigorous flushing to reveal underlying vessel) |
| **IIc** | Flat pigmented spot | 5–8% | Oral PPI only |
| **III** | Clean base | < 3% | Oral PPI only |

**Endoscopic therapy** [15]:
- ***Dual therapy: adrenaline injection + heater probe or clips*** [15]
  - ***Adrenaline 1:10,000*** — works via ***tamponade*** (volume compression of vessel) + ***vasoconstriction*** (α₁-adrenergic) + ***platelet aggregation*** [15]
  - ***Heater probe*** — ***coaptive effect: pressure + heat*** [15] — compresses the vessel while thermal energy coagulates it
  - ***Haemospray*** — ***mechanical barrier + absorbent*** [15] — useful for large-area ulcers where clips cannot cover the entire surface
  - ***Clips*** — mechanical closure of the bleeding vessel — more durable than injection alone

**Post-endoscopy management** [15]:
- ***PPI infusion: pantoprazole/esomeprazole 80mg stat, then 8mg/h for 72h*** [15]
  - Why? Higher pH stabilises clot formation because ***platelet function depends on normal pH*** — platelet aggregation is optimal at pH > 6; at pH < 5.4, pepsin is activated and dissolves clots [15]
  - ***Indicated for Forrest Class Ia, Ib, IIa, IIb ulcer bleeding*** [15]
  - ***NOT efficacious for variceal bleeding*** [15]

**When endoscopy fails** [14]:
- ***Surgery: indicated if failed endoscopic haemostasis, rebleeding failing re-scope, ongoing transfusion requirement*** [14]
  - DU: ***suture ligation of bleeding vessels → ± partial gastrectomy*** [14]
  - GU: ***partial gastrectomy*** (risk of malignant ulcer — need histology) [14]
- Interventional radiology: ***transcatheter arterial embolisation (TAE)*** if unfit for surgery [14]

#### 1B. Perforation — "Burst"

**Pathophysiology**: The ulcer erodes through the **full thickness** of the bowel wall (serosa) → gastric or duodenal contents leak into the peritoneal cavity → **chemical peritonitis** (initially from acid, bile, enzymes) → secondary **bacterial peritonitis** (from gut flora colonisation).

- **Anterior** duodenal/gastric ulcers are more likely to **perforate freely** into the peritoneal cavity (no protective structures anteriorly)
- **Posterior** ulcers tend to **penetrate** into adjacent organs (pancreas, lesser omentum) rather than perforate freely (because the pancreas and omentum provide a "wall")

**Clinical presentation** [3]:
- ***Acute onset of severe diffuse abdominal pain*** — sudden, dramatic ("thunderclap")
- ***Fever, tachycardia, hypotension*** — signs of systemic sepsis
- Board-like rigidity on examination — peritonitis causes reflex abdominal muscle spasm
- ***Erect CXR: free gas under diaphragm*** (pneumoperitoneum) — sensitivity ~75%; absence does NOT exclude perforation [10]

**Management** [14][17]:
- Resuscitation + IV antibiotics + IV PPI
- ***Small DU/GU ( < 2cm): laparoscopic/open omental patch repair*** (Graham patch) [17] — the greater omentum is mobilised and sutured over the perforation, sealing it
- ***Large DU: distal gastrectomy + Billroth II reconstruction*** [17]
- ***Large GU: wedge excision / partial gastrectomy + Billroth II reconstruction*** [17] — resection is necessary because GU may be malignant
- ***Biopsy ulcer edge for ALL gastric ulcers to rule out malignancy*** [17]

**Prognosis — Boey's Score** [17]:

| Risk Factor | Points |
|---|---|
| Time from perforation to admission > 24 hours | 1 |
| Pre-operative SBP < 100 mmHg | 1 |
| Any systemic illness (heart disease, liver disease, renal disease, DM) | 1 |
| **Score 0 = 0% mortality; 1 = 10%; 2 = 45.5%; 3 = 100%** | |

#### 1C. Gastric Outlet Obstruction (GOO) — "Block"

**Pathophysiology** [3]: Chronic peptic ulceration at or near the pylorus/duodenal bulb causes a cycle of:
1. ***Inflammation → oedema and duodenal spasm*** (reversible)
2. ***Fibrosis and scarring*** from repeated ulceration and healing (irreversible — pyloric stenosis)
3. ***Gastric atony*** develops after prolonged obstruction (the chronically distended stomach loses its contractile ability)

**Clinical presentation** [3][6]:
- ***Epigastric pain after eating***
- ***Early satiety, bloating, indigestion***
- ***Non-bilious projectile vomiting of undigested food*** (obstruction is proximal to the ampulla of Vater → bile cannot enter the stomach)
- ***Nausea, anorexia, weight loss***
- **Succussion splash** on examination ( > 4 hours post-meal) — retained fluid sloshing in a dilated stomach

**Metabolic consequences** [3]:
- ***Prolonged vomiting → hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis*** — loss of HCl (H⁺ and Cl⁻) in vomitus → kidneys compensate by retaining H⁺ and excreting K⁺ and HCO₃⁻ (but initially H⁺ retention is insufficient → alkalosis). The kidneys also paradoxically excrete acid urine ("paradoxical aciduria") because K⁺ depletion forces the distal tubule to exchange H⁺ instead of K⁺ for Na⁺ reabsorption.
- ***Risk of aspiration pneumonia*** — vomiting of retained gastric contents
- ***Dehydration***

**Management** [3]:
1. ***NPO + nasogastric (NG) tube*** — decompresses stomach, stops vomiting cycle
2. ***Fluid resuscitation + correction of electrolyte abnormalities*** — ***normal saline and KCl*** [3]
3. ***IV PPI*** — reduces ongoing acid damage, ↓ oedema around ulcer [3]
4. ***Endoscopic balloon dilatation*** — for benign pyloric stenosis [3]
5. ***Surgery if medical/endoscopic management fails*** [3]:
   - GU: antrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction
   - DU: truncal vagotomy + antrectomy with Billroth I/II reconstruction

<Callout title="GOO: Malignant Until Proven Otherwise" type="error">
In clinical practice, always remember that GOO is ***malignant in 80% of cases*** (gastric cancer being the most common cause). PUD-related pyloric stenosis is the second most common cause but accounts for only ~20% of cases. Always biopsy during endoscopy.
</Callout>

#### 1D. Penetration — "Burrow"

**Pathophysiology**: The ulcer erodes through the bowel wall but **does NOT perforate freely** — instead it penetrates into an adjacent organ. The adjacent organ "seals off" the ulcer, containing the leak.

***Penetration occurs in descending order of frequency into: Pancreas > Lesser omentum > Biliary tract > Liver > Greater omentum > Mesocolon > Colon > Vascular structures*** [3]

**Clinical presentation** [3]:
- ***Change in pain character***: more intense pain of longer duration
- ***Shift from a typical vague visceral discomfort to a localised intense pain radiating to the back*** — posterior ulcer penetrating into the pancreas
- ***NOT relieved by food or antacids*** — unlike uncomplicated PUD
- May cause secondary **pancreatitis** (ulcer penetrating into pancreas) or **cholangitis** (penetrating into biliary tract)

**Management**: ***Surgery is NOT recommended*** [3] for uncomplicated penetration. Medical management with PPI + HP eradication is preferred. Surgery reserved for failure of medical therapy or complications (e.g. pancreatitis, abscess).

#### 1E. Fistulisation

**Pathophysiology**: Penetration that creates a communication between two hollow organs.

**Clinical presentation** [3]:
- ***Gastrocolic or duodenocolic fistula*** → ***feculent vomiting*** (vomiting of faecal material — gastric contents pass into colon, or colonic contents reflux into stomach), ***postprandial diarrhoea*** (gastric acid entering colon), ***dyspepsia, weight loss*** [3]
- Rare but dramatic

**Management**: Surgical repair — fistula takedown + segmental colonic resection if needed.

---

### 2. Complications of GERD

GERD is the second most common organic cause of dyspepsia. Its complications follow a **cascade of progressive mucosal injury**:

***Oesophagitis → ulcer → stricture → Barrett's oesophagus (10%) → metaplasia → adenocarcinoma (7% of Barrett's)*** [15]

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Reflux oesophagitis** | Chronic acid/pepsin/bile exposure → inflammation → mucosal erosions (LA grade A–D) | Heartburn, odynophagia (painful swallowing due to inflamed mucosa) |
| **Oesophageal ulceration** | Deep erosion extending beyond epithelium | Odynophagia, haematemesis, chest pain |
| ***Oesophageal stricture*** [18] | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → luminal narrowing (typically distal oesophagus) | **Progressive dysphagia** (solids first, then liquids) — the gradual onset distinguishes it from malignant dysphagia (which is also progressive but usually in an older patient with weight loss). |
| ***Barrett's oesophagus*** [18] | Chronic acid exposure → **intestinal metaplasia** of distal oesophageal squamous epithelium to specialised columnar epithelium with goblet cells. This is an adaptive response — columnar epithelium is more resistant to acid than squamous epithelium — but it comes at a cost. | Often asymptomatic (because the metaplastic epithelium is LESS sensitive to acid → patients may actually feel BETTER as Barrett's develops). Diagnosed on OGD: salmon-pink mucosa extending above GOJ. |
| ***Adenocarcinoma of oesophagus*** [18] | Barrett's → low-grade dysplasia → high-grade dysplasia → invasive adenocarcinoma. ***Risk of developing cancer is 30–100× compared with normal population*** [18]. The annual risk is ~0.5%/year for non-dysplastic Barrett's, ~1%/year for low-grade dysplasia. | Progressive dysphagia, weight loss, GI bleeding, chest pain. Occurs at distal oesophagus/GOJ — the classic "adenocarcinoma at the GOJ" in a patient with long-standing GERD. |
| ***Oesophageal haemorrhage*** [18] | Erosion of oesophageal ulcer into submucosal vessels | Haematemesis, melaena, IDA |
| **Aspiration** | Nocturnal reflux reaching the larynx/pharynx → trickle aspiration | Recurrent pneumonia, chronic cough, laryngeal inflammation |

**Barrett's Oesophagus Surveillance** [18]:
- ***ALL patients with Barrett's oesophagus should receive PPI whether they are symptomatic or not*** [18]
- Non-dysplasia → surveillance OGD every 3–5 years
- Low-grade dysplasia → surveillance every 6 months for 1 year, then annually; OR endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) + radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
- High-grade dysplasia → EMR + RFA; esophagectomy if unable to achieve complete eradication

### 3. Complications of Gastric Cancer

When dyspepsia is the presenting symptom of gastric cancer, the cancer itself brings its own set of complications [18b]:

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Bleeding*** — IDA, haematemesis, melaena [18b] | Tumour erodes into mucosal vessels; malignant tissue is friable and bleeds with minimal trauma |
| ***Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)*** [18b] — abdominal distension, vomiting | Distal (antral/pyloric) tumours cause mechanical obstruction |
| ***Perforation*** → peritonitis [18b] | Tumour necrosis creates a full-thickness defect |
| **Metastatic disease** | Virchow's node (left supraclavicular LN), Sister Mary Joseph nodule (periumbilical), Krukenberg tumour (ovarian metastasis), peritoneal carcinomatosis (ascites), liver metastases (jaundice, hepatomegaly) [6] |

---

### 4. Complications of Treatment

#### 4A. Long-Term PPI Use

PPIs are the mainstay of dyspepsia management, but long-term use carries risks (all related to chronic acid suppression):

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Osteoporotic fractures** | Gastric acid enhances calcium absorption (dissolves Ca²⁺ salts). ↓ Acid → ↓ Ca²⁺ absorption → ↓ BMD → ↑ fracture risk (hip, vertebral, wrist). 20–35% ↑ risk with > 1 year PPI use. |
| **Hypomagnesaemia** | Chronic PPI use impairs intestinal Mg²⁺ absorption (mechanism unclear, possibly via altered TRPM6/7 channels). Can cause muscle cramps, arrhythmia, seizures. |
| ***C. difficile* infection** | Gastric acid is a natural barrier against ingested bacteria. ↓ Acid → ↑ survival of *C. difficile* spores → ↑ colonisation risk. |
| **Vitamin B₁₂ deficiency** | Acid and pepsin are required to release B₁₂ from food proteins. ↓ Acid → ↓ B₁₂ release → ↓ absorption. |
| **Iron deficiency** | Non-haem iron (Fe³⁺) requires acid for reduction to Fe²⁺ (absorbable form). ↓ Acid → ↓ Fe absorption. |
| **Rebound acid hypersecretion** | Chronic acid suppression → compensatory ↑ gastrin (from G-cells, due to loss of negative feedback) → ECL cell hyperplasia → trophic effect on parietal cells. When PPI is abruptly stopped → massive acid output (even higher than baseline). This is why PPIs should be **tapered gradually**, not stopped abruptly. |
| **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)** | ↓ Acid → loss of bactericidal barrier → ↑ bacterial colonisation of upper GI tract → bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea |
| **Community-acquired pneumonia** | ↓ Acid → ↑ bacterial colonisation of stomach → aspiration of colonised gastric contents → pneumonia. Risk is greatest in the first month of PPI use. |
| **Possible ↑ CKD risk** | Mechanism unclear; may relate to interstitial nephritis or altered gut microbiome. Evidence is observational and debated. |

<Callout title="The 'Lowest Dose, Shortest Duration' Principle">
Given these risks, the key management principle is: use the ***lowest dose possible PPI*** for the ***shortest duration*** needed [2]. Step down to H2RA or on-demand PPI when able. Long-term PPI is justified for Barrett's oesophagus, severe oesophagitis (LA grade C/D), and high-risk patients on dual antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy.
</Callout>

#### 4B. Prokinetic Side Effects

| Drug | Key Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Metoclopramide** | **Extrapyramidal side effects** (acute dystonia, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia) | Crosses BBB → blocks D₂ receptors in basal ganglia → loss of dopaminergic inhibition of cholinergic interneurons → excessive cholinergic drive → involuntary movements. Risk highest in **young women**. **Tardive dyskinesia** (chronic involuntary orofacial movements) is potentially irreversible. |
| **Domperidone** | **QT prolongation → ventricular arrhythmia (Torsades de Pointes)** | Blocks cardiac hERG K⁺ channels → delayed ventricular repolarisation → prolonged QT interval → increased susceptibility to triggered ventricular arrhythmias. Risk highest in **elderly** and those on concurrent QT-prolonging drugs. |

#### 4C. Post-Surgical Complications (Post-Gastrectomy Syndromes)

When PUD is severe enough to require surgery (gastrectomy, vagotomy), a distinct set of complications can arise. These are high-yield for exams [14][19][20]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dumping syndrome** (20%) [19] | ***Loss of pylorus → rapid gastric emptying of hyperosmolar carbohydrates → draw fluid into intestinal lumen*** (osmotic shift) ***and release vasoactive gut hormones*** [19] | **Early** (15–30 min): ***abdominal pain, N/V/D, vasomotor symptoms (sweating, flushing, palpitations)*** [19]. **Late** (1–3h): ***post-prandial hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia*** [19] — rapid glucose absorption → exaggerated insulin spike → rebound hypoglycaemia. | ***Small frequent meals, avoid simple carbohydrates, separate fluids from solids, octreotide*** [19] |
| ***Afferent loop syndrome*** [19][20] | ***Mechanical obstruction of afferent limb*** (in Billroth II) ***due to kinking, anastomotic narrowing, adhesions, volvulus*** [20] → accumulation of biliary and pancreatic secretions → risk of ***duodenal stump blowout*** | ***Post-prandial severe epigastric pain, non-bilious vomiting*** [20]. Risk of ***obstructive jaundice, ascending cholangitis, pancreatitis*** (high pressure transmitted back to biliopancreatic ductal system) [20]. | ***Conversion to Roux-en-Y gastrojejunostomy*** [20] |
| **Efferent loop syndrome** [20] | Intermittent obstruction of efferent limb → GOO symptoms | Abdominal pain, ***bilious vomiting*** months to years after surgery [20] | Surgical correction |
| ***Roux stasis syndrome*** [20] | ***Disruption of normal propagation in Roux limb → ectopic pacemakers → net propulsive activity proximal (towards stomach) rather than distal*** [20] | Chronic abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting aggravated by eating [20] | Prokinetics; surgical revision if refractory |
| ***Alkaline reflux gastritis*** | Bile reflux into gastric remnant (loss of pyloric barrier) → chemical gastritis | Epigastric burning, bilious vomiting, not relieved by antacids | Prokinetics; surgical conversion to Roux-en-Y (diverts bile away from remnant) |
| **Small stomach syndrome** [19] | ***Inadequate reservoir function*** after partial gastrectomy | ***Early satiety*** [19] → weight loss | ***Small frequent meals*** [19] |
| ***Post-vagotomy diarrhoea*** [20] | ***Alteration in gastric emptying and vagal denervation of small bowel and biliary tree*** [20]. Occurs in 20% after truncal vagotomy. | ***Watery, episodic diarrhoea*** [20] | Antidiarrhoeal medications; ↓ lactose intake [20] |
| **Nutritional deficiencies** [19] | Loss of gastric acid, intrinsic factor, and duodenal absorptive surface | ***B₁₂ deficiency anaemia*** (↓ intrinsic factor + ↓ acid → requires IM B₁₂ every 3 months). ***Iron deficiency*** (↓ acid to reduce Fe³⁺ → Fe²⁺). ***Calcium deficiency → osteoporosis***. ***Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency*** (loss of duodenal continuity). ***Steatorrhoea*** [19]. | B₁₂ supplementation, iron tablets, calcium + vitamin D [20] |
| **Gastric stump carcinoma** | Chronic bile reflux → chronic atrophic gastritis → intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia → carcinoma (similar to HP-driven Correa cascade). Typically develops 15–20 years post-gastrectomy. | Dyspepsia, weight loss, anaemia in a patient with remote history of gastrectomy | Surveillance OGD; surgical resection if detected |

---

### 5. Complications of Functional Dyspepsia

Functional dyspepsia does **not** cause direct structural complications (by definition, there is no organic disease). However, the chronic nature of FD leads to significant **indirect complications**:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Impaired quality of life** | Chronic symptoms (pain, fullness, nausea) → ↓ ability to eat normally → ↓ social functioning, ↓ work productivity. Studies show FD reduces quality of life comparable to moderate-severe chronic diseases. |
| **Weight loss / nutritional deficiency** | Severe early satiety and food avoidance → inadequate caloric intake. Some patients develop restrictive eating patterns (fear of eating → "sitophobia"). |
| **Psychiatric comorbidity** | Anxiety, depression, somatisation — may be bidirectional (brain-gut axis). Chronic unexplained symptoms → frustration → doctor-shopping → iatrogenic harm from unnecessary investigations and medications. |
| **Iatrogenic complications** | Over-investigation (repeated endoscopies, unnecessary CT scans), polypharmacy (long-term PPI, multiple drug trials), unnecessary surgery. ***Do not overinvestigate*** [1]. |
| **Opioid dependence** | In severe chronic pain, some patients are inappropriately prescribed opioids → central sensitisation → narcotic bowel syndrome (paradoxical worsening of pain). This should be avoided at all costs. |

<Callout title="The Biggest Complication of FD is Mismanagement" type="error">
The real danger with functional dyspepsia is not the disease itself but what we do to the patient: unnecessary repeated endoscopies, long-term unsupervised PPI use, and failure to address the psychological component. ***Reassurance after ruling out organic pathologies*** [2] is therapeutic. Conversely, the clinician who fails to investigate appropriately may miss a cancer. The balance is: thorough initial evaluation → targeted treatment → avoid escalating interventions without new clinical information.
</Callout>

---

### 6. Complications of Endoscopy (OGD)

Since OGD is the primary investigative tool for dyspepsia, its complications are relevant [3b]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism / Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **Sedation-related** | ***Hypoxaemia, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia*** [3b] | Midazolam (benzodiazepine) → CNS depression → ↓ respiratory drive, ↓ protective airway reflexes. Manage with monitoring (pulse oximetry) and reversal (IV flumazenil for midazolam). |
| | ***Hypotension, cardiac arrhythmia, AMI*** [3b] | Vagal stimulation during scope insertion → bradycardia; pre-existing cardiac disease + stress → ischaemia |
| **Intraoperative** | ***Perforation*** [3b] | Risk increased with therapeutic manoeuvres (dilatation, polypectomy, EMR/ESD) and in patients with oesophageal diverticula or thin-walled strictures. Incidence ~0.03% for diagnostic OGD, up to 1–2% for therapeutic. |
| | ***Bleeding*** [3b] | Biopsy sites, polypectomy sites. Usually self-limiting; occasionally requires endoscopic haemostasis. Incidence ~3 per 10,000. |
| **Post-procedural** | Nausea, abdominal distension, sore throat | Air insufflation → gastric distension; scope trauma to pharynx → soreness (self-limiting) |
| | **Transient dysphagia** | Due to local anaesthetic spray (LA) → temporary → resolves when LA effect wears off |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**PUD complications ("Bleed, Burst, Block, Burrow")**: (1) Haemorrhage — leading cause of PUD death; Forrest classification guides endoscopic therapy; post-OGD PPI infusion 80mg stat then 8mg/h × 72h stabilises clot. (2) Perforation — anterior ulcers perforate freely; erect CXR for pneumoperitoneum; Graham omental patch for small perforations; Boey's score predicts mortality. (3) GOO — vomiting → hypokalaemic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis; decompress (NGT), correct electrolytes, endoscopic dilatation or surgery. (4) Penetration — posterior ulcers into pancreas (back pain); fistulisation → feculent vomiting.

**GERD complications**: Oesophagitis → stricture → Barrett's → adenocarcinoma (30–100× ↑ risk). All Barrett's patients need PPI regardless of symptoms.

**Long-term PPI risks**: Osteoporotic fractures, hypoMg, C. difficile, B₁₂/Fe deficiency, rebound acid hypersecretion, SIBO, CAP. Use lowest dose for shortest duration.

**Post-gastrectomy syndromes**: Dumping syndrome (early = osmotic fluid shift + hormones; late = hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia), afferent/efferent loop syndrome, Roux stasis, alkaline reflux gastritis, nutritional deficiencies (B₁₂, Fe, Ca, fat-soluble vitamins), gastric stump carcinoma.

**FD complications**: Mainly indirect — impaired QoL, psychiatric comorbidity, iatrogenic harm from over-investigation/polypharmacy. The biggest risk is mismanagement.

Management: small frequent meals, avoid simple carbohydrates, separate fluids from solids, octreotide for refractory cases."
