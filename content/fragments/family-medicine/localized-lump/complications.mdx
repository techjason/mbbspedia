## Complications of Localized Lumps

Complications can arise from the lump itself (i.e., the natural history of the pathology if left untreated or if it progresses) or from the treatment (surgical or otherwise). Both are equally examinable. Let's go through them systematically.

---

## A. Complications of the Lump Itself (By Pathology)

### 1. Complications of Benign Lumps

Most benign lumps are innocuous — but they can still cause problems. The key concept is that even a benign lesion can become symptomatic or dangerous if it **grows, gets infected, compresses vital structures, or undergoes (rare) malignant transformation**.

#### Lipoma

- **Cosmetic disfigurement**: the most common reason for presentation — lipomas grow slowly but ***never regress*** [9]
- **Pain**: most lipomas are painless, but ***painful lipomas suggest: angiolipoma, Dercum's disease, or liposarcoma (never cutaneous!)*** [9]
  - Why is angiolipoma painful? It contains vascular channels with microthrombi that cause localised ischaemia and nerve irritation within the tumour
- **Functional impairment**: ***may be dangerous and symptomatic if in internal organs → e.g., GI tract lipoma: rapid bleeding, ulceration and painful obstruction*** [9]
- **Malignant transformation**: ***rarely undergo malignant transformation into liposarcoma*** [9] — sarcomatous elements occur in < 1% of cases, more likely if ***size > 5 cm, rapidly growing, intramuscular (thigh/shoulder) or retroperitoneal*** [1]
- **Recurrence after excision**: ***unlikely to recur after excision*** [9], ***except for deep lipomas because complete surgical removal around internal organs is difficult*** [9]

#### Sebaceous (Epidermoid) Cyst

***Complications*** [30][31]:
- ***Infection***: the ***most common complication*** — ***sudden ↑ size with erythema*** [31]. Bacteria enter through the punctum or haematogenously → acute inflammation → abscess formation
  - ***Cock's peculiar tumour***: an ***infected, open granulating oedematous sebaceous cyst → often mistaken for SCC of scalp*** [31]. Why? Because the granulation tissue looks fungating and vascular, mimicking a malignant mass
  - ***Anatomy may become distorted and fibrotic*** after recurrent infections [31] → makes subsequent excision more difficult
- ***Ulceration of overlying skin***: due to direct pressure from the enlarging cyst [31]
- ***Sebaceous horn***: ***hardened sebaceous material protruding from cyst*** [31] — ***only grows if patient fails to wash away sebaceous materials*** [31]. Looks like a cutaneous horn and can mimic SCC clinically

<Callout title="Why Does Incomplete Excision of a Sebaceous Cyst Lead to Recurrence?">
The cyst is lined by stratified squamous epithelium that produces keratin. If even a tiny fragment of the cyst wall is left behind, the remaining epithelial cells continue to produce keratin → a new cyst forms from the remnant. ***Recurrence likely if incompletely removed*** [31]. This is why you must excise the entire cyst including the wall and punctum. If the cyst is acutely infected and inflamed, ***I&D first, then defer complete excision until resolution of infection*** [31] — because inflamed tissue is friable and the cyst wall is difficult to identify, leading to incomplete excision.
</Callout>

#### Ganglion Cyst

- **Pain**: if the ganglion compresses adjacent nerves
- ***Neurological deficit if nerve impingement*** [10] — e.g., dorsal wrist ganglion can compress the posterior interosseous nerve → wrist pain; volar wrist ganglion can compress the median nerve → carpal tunnel-like symptoms
- **High recurrence**: ***up to 50% recurrence*** [10] even after surgical excision, because the communication with the joint capsule may reform

#### Dermoid Cyst

***Complications*** [7][30]:
- ***Infection***: ***especially if dermal sinus tract present*** [30]. The sinus tract creates a direct communication between the cyst and the skin surface → allows bacterial entry
- ***Intracranial extension***: ***1/4 of nasal/midline dermoid cysts associated with CNS connection*** [7] → risk of meningitis if the cyst becomes infected and communicates intracranially. This is why ***neuroimaging is mandatory*** before excision of midline dermoid cysts

#### Haemangioma (Infantile)

***Complications*** [32][33]:
- ***Ulceration***: ***MOST common complication of haemangioma*** [32], ***↑ risk if rapidly proliferating, in trauma or pressure-prone areas*** [33]. Why? Rapidly growing tissue outstrips its blood supply → superficial necrosis → ulceration. Ulcerated haemangiomas are painful and prone to secondary infection
- ***Bleeding***: ***rarely profuse and can generally be stopped with application of direct pressure*** [32]
- ***Airway haemangioma***: ***risk is higher in segmental haemangiomas located in a cervicofacial, mandibular or "beard" distribution*** [32][33]. ***Presents with cough, progressive hoarseness, stridor, cyanosis and may progress to respiratory failure*** [32]. Why cervicofacial? Because the same developmental field that gives rise to the external facial haemangioma also supplies the subglottic airway → "beard distribution" haemangioma = high suspicion for concomitant airway lesion
- ***Periorbital haemangioma***: ***majority that lead to visual complications involve the upper medial eyelid*** [32][33]
  - ***Astigmatism***: ***most common complication — from direct pressure of growing haemangioma on the cornea*** [32]
  - ***Stimulus-deprivation amblyopia***: ***physical obstruction of visual axis by haemangioma*** [32] → the brain "turns off" the image from that eye during the critical visual development period
  - ***Proptosis***: ***subcutaneous periocular haemangioma may extend deep into the orbit causing exophthalmos or globe displacement*** [32]
- **High-output heart failure**: large AV shunts within giant haemangiomas (especially hepatic) → ↑ venous return → volume overload → cardiac failure
- ***Kasabach-Merritt syndrome***: ***rare consumptive coagulopathy due to sequestration of platelets and clotting factors in giant haemangioma → requires urgent resection*** [21]

#### Pyogenic Granuloma

- ***Easy bleeding***: ***the primary complication*** — ***friable surface that bleeds profusely after minor trauma*** [30]. The lesion is a mass of capillary loops with a thin epithelial covering that is easily disrupted. This is why ***excision is recommended due to ↑↑ bleeding risk despite tendency to regress spontaneously*** [12]

#### Baker's (Popliteal) Cyst

***Complications*** [30]:
- ***Enlargement: compression of artery, veins, nerves*** — popliteal artery compression → claudication; popliteal vein compression → leg swelling (mimics DVT)
- ***Rupture: severe calf pain + swelling*** → ***d/dx DVT, cellulitis*** [30]. Ruptured Baker's cyst and DVT are clinically almost indistinguishable → always do Doppler USG to exclude DVT before attributing calf swelling to a ruptured cyst

### 2. Complications of Malignant Lumps

#### Local Complications (All Malignant Lumps)

| Complication | Mechanism | Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Local invasion** | Tumour grows beyond capsule into adjacent structures | Thyroid CA → ***RLN palsy (hoarseness), tracheal compression (stridor), oesophageal invasion (dysphagia)*** [3]. Breast CA → fixation to chest wall. Skin cancer → bone/cartilage invasion |
| **Ulceration** | Tumour outgrows blood supply → central necrosis → skin breakdown | Fungating breast tumour; rodent ulcer (BCC); ulcerated SCC |
| **Obstruction** | Tumour compresses hollow viscus or duct | Thyroid → trachea; oesophageal CA → dysphagia; bile duct → jaundice |
| **Haemorrhage** | Erosion into blood vessel | Massive bleeding from aortic erosion by oesophageal CA; GI bleeding from ulcerated GI tumours |
| **Fistula formation** | Tumour erodes through wall of one structure into another | Tracheo-oesophageal fistula (→ ***aspiration pneumonia***); colovesical fistula |
| **Pathological fracture** | Bone metastasis weakens bone → fracture with minimal trauma | Long bone fracture (femur most common); vertebral compression fracture |

#### Regional Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Lymph node metastasis** | Tumour cells travel via lymphatics → regional LN involvement → hard, fixed, non-tender nodes |
| ***Lymphoedema*** | Lymphatic obstruction by tumour or post-surgical/radiation disruption of lymphatic drainage → ***oedema with high protein content*** [11] |
| **Nerve involvement** | Direct invasion or compression → neuropathy, paralysis |

#### Systemic Complications (Metastatic Disease)

| Site of Metastasis | Common Primary Tumours | Presentation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Bone** | Breast, lung, prostate, thyroid, kidney | ***Bone pain***, pathological fracture, hypercalcaemia (osteolytic lesions release calcium) |
| **Lung/Pleura** | Breast, colon, kidney | ***SOB***, cough, pleural effusion |
| **Liver** | Colorectal, breast, lung | Hepatomegaly, jaundice, RUQ pain, deranged LFTs |
| **Brain** | Lung, breast, melanoma, RCC | Headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits |
| **Adrenal** | Lung, breast, melanoma | Usually asymptomatic; rarely adrenal insufficiency |

#### Paraneoplastic Syndromes

Some lumps (especially lung, renal, and neuroendocrine tumours) can produce systemic effects through hormones or immune-mediated mechanisms:
- Hypercalcaemia (PTHrP — SCC of lung, RCC)
- SIADH (SCLC)
- Cushing's syndrome (ectopic ACTH — SCLC, carcinoid)
- Dermatomyositis, acanthosis nigricans (markers of underlying malignancy)

---

### 3. Complications Specific to Thyroid Lumps

***Complications of the thyroid lump itself*** [3]:
- ***Pain: bleeding into cyst/necrotic nodule, subacute thyroiditis***
- ***Compressive symptoms: dyspnoea (trachea), dysphagia (oesophagus), dysphonia (RLN)***
- ***High output HF: dyspnoea, effort tolerance*** — from thyrotoxicosis
- ***Thyroid storm: fever, confusion*** — uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis precipitated by stress/surgery

---

## B. Complications of Treatment

### 1. General Surgical Complications (Apply to Any Lump Excision)

| Timing | Complication | Pathophysiology |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Immediate** | ***Haemorrhage*** | Vessel injury during dissection |
| | ***Anaesthetic complications*** | Airway, cardiovascular, drug reactions |
| **Early** | ***Wound infection*** | Bacterial contamination (S. aureus most common) |
| | ***Haematoma*** | Ongoing ooze from wound bed → blood collects under skin flaps |
| | ***Seroma*** | ***Collection of serous fluid*** [26] — lymphatic disruption → serous fluid accumulates. ***Untreated seroma → delayed wound healing, wound infection, dehiscence, flap necrosis and poor cosmetic outcomes*** [26] |
| **Late** | ***Scarring / keloid / hypertrophic scar*** | Abnormal wound healing. ***Hypertrophic: confined to wound margin, regresses in 2–3 months. Keloid: extends beyond wound margins, continues to enlarge for 6 months to 1 year*** [30] |
| | **Recurrence** | Incomplete excision (especially sebaceous cyst, ganglion) |
| | **Nerve injury** | Inadvertent damage during dissection |

### 2. Complications of Mastectomy + Axillary Surgery

This is a **must-know** topic for exams:

***Complications of mastectomy*** [25][27]:
- ***Seroma, haematoma, wound infection***
- ***Skin flap / NAC necrosis (if reconstruction)*** — ischaemia of skin flap edges → necrosis → may require debridement + skin graft [25]
- ***Arm morbidities: arm or shoulder pain, numbness, frozen shoulder*** [27]
- ***Phantom breast syndrome: altered chest wall sensation, might persist years after surgery*** [27]
- ***Post-mastectomy pain syndrome: up to 50%, often associated with neuropathic phenomena (burning, aching, stiffness, paraesthesia) in axilla, upper arm, chest wall*** [25]

***Complications of ALND — "4 nerves" plus other structures*** [28][25]:

| ***Structure Injured*** | ***Result*** | ***Mechanism*** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Long thoracic nerve*** | ***Serratus anterior paralysis → pain, weakness, limitation of shoulder elevation, winging of scapula (↑ by pushing against wall)*** [25] | Runs on chest wall surface of serratus anterior → easily damaged if dissection goes too posteriorly |
| ***Thoracodorsal nerve (+ artery and vein)*** | ***Latissimus dorsi paralysis → unable to raise trunk with UL (e.g. climbing)*** [25], weak shoulder adduction and internal rotation [28] | Runs as a neurovascular bundle → should be identified and preserved |
| ***Intercostobrachial nerve*** | ***Paraesthesia of axilla, medial arm and lateral chest wall*** [28]. ***Easily damaged*** [25] | Sensory nerve that crosses the axilla — most commonly injured nerve during ALND |
| ***Medial pectoral nerve*** | ***Pec major weakness*** [28] | Runs deep to pec minor → at risk during Level II clearance |
| ***Axillary vein*** | Haemorrhage, upper limb oedema | Major vein in the axilla |
| ***Brachial plexus*** | Rare — motor and sensory deficit in upper limb | ***Far from axillary dissection → very rarely damaged except in extensive tumours*** [25] |
| ***Lymphatics*** | ***Upper limb lymphoedema (10–40%)*** [25] — ***↑ risk if axillary RT*** | Disruption of axillary lymphatic drainage. ***Mx: arm physiotherapy, pneumatic compression devices, fitted compression sleeves*** [25] |
| | ***UL lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome)*** [28] | Rare late complication of chronic lymphoedema → malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelium. Typically presents 5–15 years post-mastectomy as purplish nodules on a chronically oedematous arm |

***Complications of breast implants*** [34]:

| ***Complication*** | ***Description*** |
|:---|:---|
| ***Mechanical*** | ***Migration, malposition, exposure, rupture. Majority of rupture are often silent. Present with changes in breast shape/volume, capsular contracture, palpable lumps (breast or axilla), and pain*** |
| ***Implant infections*** | ***Managed by antibiotics ± explantation and irrigation of the pocket → closure over closed suction drainage*** |
| ***Capsular contracture*** | ***Esp. post-infection, radiation. Painful fibrous capsule around implant → palpable distortion of breast*** — Why? The body forms a fibrous capsule around any foreign body (normal response); excessive fibrosis contracts the capsule → compresses and distorts the implant |
| ***Breast implant associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma*** | ***ALK –ve, CD30 +ve. Disease confined to the capsule: capsulectomy alone is curative. Adjuvant therapies if needed: chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) or anti-CD30 (brentuximab vedotin)*** |

[34]

<Callout title="Stewart-Treves Syndrome — A Rare but High-Yield Complication" type="error">
***UL lymphangiosarcoma (Stewart-Treves syndrome)*** [28] is a rare but classic complication of chronic lymphoedema following mastectomy + ALND ± axillary RT. It presents years later as purplish-red nodules on a chronically swollen arm. The pathophysiology is thought to involve chronic lymphatic stasis → impaired immune surveillance → malignant transformation of lymphatic endothelial cells. It is highly aggressive with poor prognosis. This is a favourite exam viva question: "What is the late complication of chronic lymphoedema after breast cancer treatment?"
</Callout>

### 3. Complications of Thyroidectomy

This is another **must-know** area. ***Complications of thyroidectomy*** [35]:

| ***Timing*** | ***Complication*** | ***Pathophysiology and Clinical Features*** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Immediate (intraoperative)*** | ***Intraoperative bleeding*** | Thyroid is highly vascular; superior/inferior thyroid arteries |
| | ***Oesophageal injury*** | Posterior dissection |
| | ***Tracheal injury*** | Anterior dissection |
| | ***Tracheomalacia*** | ***Degeneration of tracheal cartilage following removal of compression by large goitre*** [35] → the trachea has been chronically compressed and the cartilage has become softened; once the goitre is removed, the trachea may collapse |
| | ***Thyroid storm*** | ***Develops in patients with longstanding untreated hyperthyroidism precipitated by surgery → rapid ↑ in serum thyroid hormone → ↑ response to catecholamines → hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension → heart failure with hypotension and arrhythmia*** [35] |
| | ***Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) injury*** | ***SLN supplies the cricothyroid muscle which lengthens (tenses) the vocal cord to produce high-pitched sound → presents with vocal fatigue and changes in voice quality*** [35]. ***Important to ask if the patient is a professional singer pre-op*** [35] |
| | ***Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury*** | ***RLN supplies all intrinsic muscles of larynx except cricothyroid*** [35]. ***Ipsilateral RLN injury → unilateral vocal cord palsy → hoarseness and ineffective cough*** [35]. ***Bilateral RLN injury → bilateral vocal cord palsy → stridor and dyspnoea (airway obstruction)*** [35]. ***↑ risk of aspiration pneumonia*** [35] |
| ***Immediate ( < 24h)*** | ***Haematoma (1.25%)*** | ***Uncommon but fatal. Usually in paratracheal region below strap muscles → causes venous obstruction → acute laryngeal oedema → risk of airway compromise*** [35]. ***S/S: large, tense, firm immobile neck swelling + SOB*** [35]. ***Mx: cut subcuticular stitches and stitches holding strap muscles (evacuate all blood) → call seniors for intubation*** [35] |
| | ***Seroma*** | ***Superficial, mobile (self-limiting)*** [35] |
| ***Intermediate (1 day – 1 month)*** | ***Wound infection*** | Standard surgical wound infection |
| | ***Hypoparathyroidism → hypocalcaemia*** | ***MOST common complication*** [35]. ***Risk: 1–4% permanent (esp in cancer surgery), 10–20% transient (esp in ischaemia)*** [35]. ***Reason: often due to compromise of inferior thyroid artery*** [35] which supplies the parathyroid glands. ***S/S: CATS GO NUMB — Convulsion, Arrhythmia, Tetany, Laryngospasm, NUMBNESS (perioral, distal)*** [35]. ***Ix: serum Ca, ECG (long QT ± arrhythmia)*** [35]. ***Mx: Fast replacement — IV 10–20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over 10 min (slow bolus). Replacement — calcium carbonate + calcitriol (vitamin D)*** [35] |
| | ***Hungry bone syndrome*** | ***May occur in those with pre-op hyperthyroidism → pre-op high bone turnover with sudden ↓ PTH → ↑↑↑ bone ossification → sudden hypocalcaemia*** [35]. The now-suppressed PTH can no longer mobilise calcium from bone, and the hyperactive osteoblasts (driven by previous high bone turnover) rapidly deposit calcium into bone |
| ***Late*** | ***Recurrence*** | Incomplete thyroidectomy for cancer |
| | ***Hypertrophic scar and keloid formation*** | Anterior neck is a high-tension wound |
| | ***Hypothyroidism*** | Expected after total thyroidectomy → requires lifelong levothyroxine replacement |

<Callout title="Post-Thyroidectomy Haematoma — A Surgical Emergency!">
***Haematoma after thyroidectomy is uncommon (1.25%) but potentially fatal*** [35]. The paratracheal space is a closed compartment — even a small amount of blood causes venous congestion and laryngeal oedema → airway compromise can develop within minutes. ***The immediate management is to open the wound at the bedside (cut subcuticular stitches and strap muscle stitches) to evacuate blood*** [35]. Do NOT wait for the patient to go back to theatre — decompress at the bedside first, then intubate and return to OT for definitive haemostasis.
</Callout>

### 4. Complications of Biopsy Procedures

***Complications of percutaneous biopsy*** [36]:
- ***Vascular damage: bleeding, arteriovenous fistulas, pseudoaneurysm***
- ***Infection***
- ***Organ injury, e.g. pancreatitis (2–3%) if normal pancreas punctured***
- ***Needle tract tumour seeding (rare, 0.003–0.009%)***
- ***Pneumothorax (10–30%, 1/3 require chest drain) in lung biopsy***
- ***Haemoptysis (2–12%, usually mild) in lung biopsy***

**Why is FNAC contraindicated in hepatic haemangioma?** [21] Because haemangioma is a vascular lesion composed of endothelium-lined blood-filled spaces. Puncturing it with a needle → uncontrollable haemorrhage from the highly vascular mass, potentially causing life-threatening intra-abdominal bleeding. The diagnosis can be made confidently by imaging alone (characteristic centripetal "filling-in" pattern on triphasic CT or MRI).

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of Localized Lumps — Key Exam Points:**

1. ***Sebaceous cyst complications***: infection (most common — Cock's peculiar tumour mimics SCC), ulceration, sebaceous horn. ***Recurrence if incompletely excised*** — must remove entire cyst wall.
2. ***Haemangioma***: ulceration is the ***most common complication***. Beard distribution = risk of airway haemangioma. Upper medial eyelid = astigmatism, amblyopia, proptosis. ***Kasabach-Merritt syndrome*** = consumptive coagulopathy in giant haemangioma.
3. ***ALND complications (4 nerves)***: Long thoracic (winged scapula), Thoracodorsal (lat dorsi weakness), Intercostobrachial (paraesthesia medial arm — most commonly injured), Medial pectoral (pec major weakness). Plus lymphoedema (10–40%), and late ***Stewart-Treves syndrome*** (lymphangiosarcoma).
4. ***Post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia***: ***most common complication*** — due to damage/devascularisation of parathyroid glands. ***CATS GO NUMB***: Convulsion, Arrhythmia, Tetany, Laryngospasm, Numbness. ***Mx: IV calcium gluconate then oral calcium + calcitriol***.
5. ***Post-thyroidectomy haematoma***: uncommon but ***potentially fatal*** — open wound at bedside immediately (cut stitches to evacuate blood).
6. ***RLN injury***: unilateral = hoarseness + ineffective cough; bilateral = ***stridor + dyspnoea (airway emergency)***. SLN injury = vocal fatigue, cannot sing high pitch.
7. ***Breast implant complications***: capsular contracture (most common late Cx), rupture (often silent), infection, ***breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL)***.
8. ***Percutaneous biopsy Cx***: bleeding, infection, organ injury, pneumothorax (lung Bx: 10–30%), needle tract tumour seeding (rare).
9. **Post-mastectomy pain syndrome**: up to 50%, neuropathic in character — an important and under-recognised complication.
