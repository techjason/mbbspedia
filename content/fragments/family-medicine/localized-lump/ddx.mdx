## Differential Diagnosis of a Localized Lump

The differential diagnosis (DDx) of a localized lump is arguably one of the broadest in all of surgery. The key to narrowing it down is a **structured, layered approach**: you use the **site**, the **tissue layer** of origin, and the **clinical characteristics** to whittle a huge list into a handful of likely diagnoses.

Think of it this way: the history and examination you performed in the previous section aren't just descriptive — they are **diagnostic tools**. Every feature you elicited (site, consistency, mobility, skin attachment, transillumination, cough impulse, etc.) is now used to differentiate one lump from another.

---

### Overarching Framework: The Layer-Based Differential

The single most useful framework is to think **"which tissue layer does this lump arise from?"** — because each layer has its own set of pathologies. The examination findings tell you the layer; the layer tells you the differential.

| Layer | Benign | Malignant |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Epidermis*** | ***Papilloma, viral warts, seborrhoeic keratosis, keratoacanthoma*** | ***Bowen's disease (SCC-in-situ), squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma*** |
| ***Dermis*** | ***Sebaceous cyst (epidermoid cyst), acrochordon (skin tag), neurofibroma, dermatofibroma*** | ***Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans*** |
| ***Subcutaneous tissue*** | ***Lipoma, angiolipoma, dermoid cyst, ganglion cyst*** | ***Liposarcoma*** |
| ***Bone*** | ***Osteoma*** | Osteosarcoma, bone metastasis |
| ***Melanocytes*** | ***Pigmented naevus (moles)*** | ***Malignant melanoma*** |
| ***Vascular*** | ***Pyogenic granuloma, cherry angioma (Campbell de Morgan spot)*** | Angiosarcoma, Kaposi sarcoma |
| ***Nerves*** | ***Glioma*** (peripheral), schwannoma | Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour |

[1][2]

This table is your **mental scaffold**. When you see a lump, ask yourself: "Is this epidermal, dermal, subcutaneous, or deeper?" — then run through the relevant column.

<Callout title="Why Layer Matters More Than Anything Else" type="idea">
A lipoma is subcutaneous → it is NOT attached to overlying skin and you can pinch the skin separately from it. An epidermoid cyst is dermal → it IS attached to the skin and moves with it. A dermatofibroma is dermal → it dimples when pinched (buttonhole sign) because it is tethered into the dermis. These are not random exam findings — they are direct consequences of which layer the lump arises from. **Always determine the layer first.**

### Site-Specific Differentials

While the layer-based approach works for any lump, certain anatomical sites have their own characteristic differential lists that you must know cold. Let's go through the high-yield ones.

---

#### A. Differential Diagnosis of an Anterior Neck Lump

***D/dx of anterior neck lump:*** [3]
- ***Thyroid enlargement*** (diffuse = Graves'/Hashimoto's/multinodular goitre; focal = solitary nodule/cyst/carcinoma)
- ***Lymphadenopathy*** (reactive, TB, lymphoma, metastatic — in HK always think NPC)
- ***Skin lumps and bumps*** (lipoma, sebaceous cyst, dermoid)
- ***Branchial cyst (if paediatric)*** — anterior to SCM, fluctuant, transilluminant
- ***Thyroglossal duct cyst (if paediatric)*** — midline, moves on swallowing AND tongue protrusion

**How do you differentiate?**

| Feature | Thyroid | Thyroglossal Cyst | Branchial Cyst | Lymph Node |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Position** | Central/lateral neck, overlying thyroid | Midline, at or below hyoid | Anterior border of SCM | Variable; follows nodal stations |
| **Moves on swallowing** | Yes (pretracheal fascia) | Yes (attached to hyoid) | No | No |
| **Moves on tongue protrusion** | No | ***Yes*** (thyroglossal duct connects foramen caecum → hyoid → thyroid) | No | No |
| **Consistency** | Firm (nodule) or diffuse (goitre) | Smooth, cystic | Smooth, cystic | Rubbery (lymphoma), hard (metastatic), soft (reactive) |
| **Transillumination** | Negative (solid) | Positive (fluid) | Positive (fluid) | Negative |
| **Age** | Any age | Children/young adults | Late childhood/young adults | Any |

**Why does a thyroglossal cyst move on tongue protrusion?** The thyroglossal duct runs from the foramen caecum of the tongue → through or near the hyoid bone → to the thyroid's final position. Even after the duct obliterates, a cyst along this tract retains a fibrous attachment to the hyoid. When you protrude the tongue, the genioglossus and hyoglossus muscles pull the hyoid upward and forward → the cyst is dragged with it. A thyroid lump does NOT do this because it has no attachment to the hyoid.

#### B. Differential Diagnosis of a Groin Lump

This is a classic exam favourite. The key structures passing through the groin are: inguinal canal, femoral vessels, saphenous vein, lymph nodes, and the spermatic cord.

| Classification | Differential | Key Distinguishing Feature |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Hernia** | ***Inguinal hernia*** | Cough impulse +ve, cannot get above it, reducible (if not incarcerated) |
| | ***Femoral hernia*** | Below and lateral to pubic tubercle, more common in females, cannot reduce easily |
| **Vascular** | ***Femoral artery aneurysm*** | Pulsatile AND expansile (expands in all directions with each pulse) |
| | ***Saphenous varix*** | Soft, compressible, disappears on lying down, blue tinge, ***thrill on cough*** (not just impulse) |
| **Lymphatics** | ***Inguinal lymph node*** | Discrete, firm/rubbery, non-pulsatile, non-reducible. Reactive (tender, soft) vs metastatic (hard, fixed) vs lymphoma (rubbery, non-tender) |
| | ***Lymphoma*** | Rubbery, non-tender, may be multiple, ± B symptoms |
| **Nerves** | ***Neuroma*** | Tender on palpation, Tinel sign +ve, along nerve distribution |
| **Soft tissues** | ***Lipoma*** | Soft, slip sign +ve, mobile, not attached to skin |
| | ***Abscess*** | Hot, tender, fluctuant, erythematous, ± cellulitis |
| **Others** | ***Undescended testis*** | Empty ipsilateral scrotum, lump in inguinal canal |
| | ***Communicating hydrocele (males)*** | Transilluminant, fluctuant, can get above it (cf. inguinal hernia you cannot) — but increases in size during the day |
| | ***Hydrocele of spermatic cord (males)*** | Encysted, transilluminant, within inguinal canal |
| | ***Hydrocele of canal of Nuck (females)*** | Female equivalent of encysted hydrocele of cord |

[1]

**Why can you "get above" a femoral hernia but not an inguinal hernia?** An inguinal hernia emerges from the deep inguinal ring, which is above the inguinal ligament, inside the abdominopelvic cavity — so you physically cannot place your examining fingers above the lump's origin. A femoral hernia emerges through the femoral canal, which is below the inguinal ligament — the inguinal ligament itself separates you from the abdominal cavity, so you CAN palpate above the lump. The same applies to lymph nodes, saphenous varix, etc.

**How do you tell a saphenous varix from a femoral hernia?** Both have a cough impulse. But a varix has a ***thrill*** on coughing (because of turbulent venous blood flow through the incompetent saphenofemoral junction), disappears completely on lying down (venous drainage empties it), and has a bluish colour. A hernia has an *impulse* on coughing but no thrill, may or may not reduce on lying down, and is not blue.

#### C. Differential Diagnosis of a Breast Lump

***Triple assessment (clinical + radiological + pathological)*** is the gold standard approach for any breast lump [4][5]. But clinically, the differential is narrowed by age and lump characteristics:

| Condition | Age | Consistency | Mobility | Pain | Key Feature |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Fibroadenoma*** | ***Reproductive age*** | ***Rubbery*** | ***Highly mobile ("breast mouse")*** | Painless | ***Well-defined, can be multiple & bilateral*** [4] |
| ***Breast cyst*** | Young female (or perimenopausal) | ***Soft & fluctuant*** | Mobile | ***± tender*** | ***USG: fluid-filled. Aspiration diagnostic and therapeutic*** [4] |
| ***Fibrocystic changes (most common benign breast disorder)*** | ***Young female*** | Nodular | Variable | ***Cyclical painful mass/nodularity*** | ***Serosanguinous nipple discharge, related to menstrual cycle*** [4] |
| ***Fat necrosis*** | Any | Firm | May be tethered | Usually painless | ***History of trauma or breast reconstruction***. ***Mimics CA clinically & radiologically*** [4] |
| ***Breast carcinoma*** | Usually > 30y | ***Hard*** | ***Fixed*** (to skin or muscle) | ***Non-tender*** | ***Irregular/nodular surface, poorly-defined edge, dimpling, peau d'orange*** [5] |
| ***Intraductal papilloma*** | ***Perimenopausal*** | May not be palpable | — | — | ***Bloody nipple discharge*** [4] |
| ***Phyllodes tumour*** | ***Older age (> 40)*** | Smooth, firm | ***Mobile*** | Painless | ***Can be malignant (haematogenous spread, ALND not required)*** [4] |
| ***Mastitis / breast abscess*** | ***Lactational, 1st child*** | Induration / ***fluctuant (abscess)*** | — | ***Tender*** | ***S. aureus, erythema, fever, purulent discharge*** [4] |
| ***Mondor's disease*** | Any | Cord-like | — | ***Chest pain*** | ***Palpable subcutaneous cord*** (superficial ***sclerosing thrombophlebitis*** of ***thoraco-epigastric vein***) [4] |

**Why is the upper outer quadrant the most common site for breast carcinoma?** Because it contains the largest volume of breast tissue (~50% of glandular tissue) and the axillary tail of Spence. More glandular tissue = more epithelial cells at risk of malignant transformation = higher probability of carcinoma developing there.

<Callout title="Fat Necrosis: The Great Mimicker" type="error">
***Fat necrosis can mimic breast carcinoma clinically (painless lump, skin dimpling, nipple retraction) AND radiologically (spiculated mass on mammogram)*** [4][5]. Students often forget to ask about a ***history of trauma or previous breast procedures*** — this is the key distinguishing question. Always biopsy to rule out carcinoma.
</Callout>

#### D. Differential Diagnosis of a Skin Lump/Ulcer

This overlaps heavily with the layer-based approach above, but here we focus on clinical differentiation of the most commonly confused lesions:

##### BCC vs SCC vs Keratoacanthoma vs Melanoma

| Feature | ***BCC*** | ***SCC*** | ***Keratoacanthoma*** | ***Melanoma*** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Growth rate** | Slow (months-years) | ***More rapid growth*** [6] | ***Rapid (2–4 weeks growth, 2–3 months to regress)*** [2] | Variable; nodular melanoma can grow rapidly |
| **Edge** | ***Rolled (pearly) edge*** [6] | ***Everted edge*** [6] | Volcano-like with central crater | Irregular, asymmetric |
| **Surface** | ***Central ulceration (rodent ulcer)*** [6] | ***Hyperkeratotic or ulcerated, fleshy granulomatous base*** [6] | ***Central keratin-filled crater*** [2] | May be flat, raised, or ulcerated |
| **Colour** | ***Pigmented in Asians*** [6]; pearly/translucent in Caucasians | Red-brown | Skin-coloured, black necrotic core | Brown-black (or amelanotic — pink) |
| **Bleeding** | Less common | ***Contact bleeding (more common than BCC)*** [6] | Not typical | Can bleed if ulcerated |
| **LN involvement** | ***Almost never metastasizes*** | ***± LN*** [6] | No (benign, self-resolving) | Common in advanced disease |
| **Spontaneous regression** | No | No | ***Yes — characteristic*** [2] | No (except rare partial regression) |
| **Key ddx for BCC** | ***Keratoacanthoma, SCC, intradermal naevus, sebaceous cyst, melanoma (if pigmented)*** [6] | | | |
| **Key ddx for SCC** | | ***Keratoacanthoma, infected wart, actinic keratosis, pyogenic granuloma, amelanotic melanoma, BCC*** [6] | | |

[2][6]

**Why does a keratoacanthoma regress spontaneously?** It arises from the infundibulum of a hair follicle with rapid keratinocyte proliferation forming a dome with a central keratin plug. The leading theory is that immune recognition eventually triggers apoptosis and regression — the central keratin core separates and the lump collapses, leaving a depressed scar [2]. However, because ***clinical and histopathological features closely resemble SCC***, you should ***ALWAYS suspect malignancy in keratoacanthoma*** [2] and excise for definitive histology.

##### Epidermoid Cyst vs Lipoma vs Dermoid Cyst vs Dermatofibroma

| Feature | **Epidermoid Cyst** | ***Lipoma*** | ***Dermoid Cyst*** | ***Dermatofibroma*** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Layer** | Dermis | ***Subcutaneous*** | Subcutaneous (congenital) or dermis (implantation) | Dermis |
| **Attached to skin** | Yes — has a ***punctum*** | ***No — NOT attached to overlying skin*** [1] | ***Not attached to skin*** [7] | ***Fixed to subcutaneous tissue*** [8] |
| **Consistency** | Firm, slightly compressible | ***Soft*** | ***Rubbery, noncompressible*** [7] | ***Firm 'woody' consistency*** [8] |
| **Mobility** | Moves with skin | ***Mobile in all directions, +ve slip sign*** [9] | Limited | Limited (fixed deep) |
| **Special sign** | Punctum (blocked follicle ostium) | Slip sign | ***Dermal sinus (pit on overlying skin) ± tuft of hair*** [7] | ***Buttonhole sign (dimples when pinched)*** [8] |
| **Transillumination** | Negative | Negative | Negative | Negative |
| **Contents** | Keratin (cheesy, foul-smelling) | Mature fat cells | Mixed tissues (skin, hair, fat, teeth) | Fibroblastic tissue |

**Why does a dermatofibroma dimple when pinched (buttonhole sign)?** The dermatofibroma is a ***benign dermal proliferation of fibroblasts*** [8] that is tethered to the subcutaneous tissue below it. When you pinch the overlying skin, the skin is lifted but the tethered lesion cannot rise — so the skin dimples inward over the fixed lesion, creating the characteristic "buttonhole" or dimple sign.

---

#### E. Differential Diagnosis of a Subcutaneous Cystic/Soft Lump

| Feature | ***Lipoma*** | ***Ganglion*** | **Sebaceous Cyst** | ***Abscess*** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Site** | Shoulder, neck, trunk, UL [9] | ***Dorsal wrist (70%)*** [10] | Hair-bearing areas (scalp, face, trunk) | Anywhere, especially friction sites |
| **Consistency** | ***Soft*** | ***Firm, rubbery*** [10] | Firm | ***Fluctuant*** |
| **Transillumination** | Negative | ***Positive*** [10] (contains gelatinous fluid) | Negative | Negative (pus is opaque) |
| **Tenderness** | Non-tender | Usually non-tender (unless nerve compression) | Non-tender unless infected | ***Tender, warm, erythematous*** |
| **Mobility** | ***Mobile in all directions*** | Attached to ***joint capsule/tendon sheath*** → limited [10] | Attached to skin (punctum) | Fixed (surrounded by inflammation) |
| **Key feature** | Slip sign | Location near joint; ***never becomes malignant*** [10] | Punctum; cheesy discharge if ruptures | Fever, surrounding cellulitis |

---

#### F. Differential Diagnosis of Lymphadenopathy Presenting as a Lump

Lymph nodes can present as lumps anywhere along the lymphatic chain. The clinical features of the node itself help narrow the differential:

| Feature | Reactive/Infective | TB | Lymphoma | Metastatic Carcinoma |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Consistency** | ***Soft*** [11] | Firm initially → caseous ("cold abscess") | ***Firm, rubbery*** [11] | ***Hard*** [11] |
| **Tenderness** | Tender | Non-tender (cold abscess) | Non-tender | Non-tender |
| **Matting** | No | Yes (perinodal caseation) | Sometimes | Sometimes (perinodal invasion) |
| **Fixation** | Mobile | May be fixed (matted) | Mobile or fixed | ***Fixed*** (invasion beyond capsule) |
| **Distribution** | Draining infection territory | Cervical (in HK — think TB); can be any | Generalised or localised | Draining the primary tumour site |
| **Systemic features** | Fever, local infection signs | Fever, night sweats, weight loss (TB constitutional symptoms) | ***B symptoms***: fever, drenching night sweats, > 10% weight loss in 6 months | Symptoms of primary malignancy |
| **Biopsy** | Not usually needed | Caseating granulomas, AFB on ZN stain | ***Excisional biopsy required*** (FNAC useless — architectural detail needed) [11] | FNAC/core biopsy often sufficient |

[11]

<Callout title="FNAC is Useless for Lymphoma!" type="error">
***FNAC provides cytological information only — it is useless in lymphoma*** because lymphoma diagnosis requires **architectural detail** (e.g., nodular vs diffuse pattern, Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's). ***Excisional biopsy is the mode of choice when suspecting lymphoma*** [11]. Core-needle or incisional biopsy is second-line (only if excision not feasible).
</Callout>

#### G. Differential Diagnosis of Vascular Lumps

| Feature | **Haemangioma (infantile)** | ***Pyogenic Granuloma*** | ***Cherry Angioma*** | **AV Malformation** | **Aneurysm** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Age** | Infancy (grows, then involutes) | ***Any age (peak 20–30y or pregnancy)*** [12] | ***Usually > 30y, more common in elderly*** [12] | Congenital (may present later) | Older adults |
| **Growth** | Rapid in first year, then involutes | ***Rapidly developing over a few weeks then stabilises*** [12] | ***Slow*** [12] | Gradual | Gradual |
| **Appearance** | Bright red, well-demarcated, raised | ***Bright red, dome-shaped, moist, glistening surface*** [12] | ***Deep red, smooth papules (1–4mm)*** [12] | Pulsatile, may have bruit | Pulsatile, expansile |
| **Bleeding** | Rarely | ***Bleeds easily upon minor trauma (friable)*** [12] | ***Not as friable but profuse bleed if rupture*** [12] | If eroded | Not usually |
| **Compressibility** | Yes | — | ***Blanch with pressure*** [12] | Yes | Partially |
| **Number** | Usually solitary | ***Usually solitary*** [12] | ***Usually multiple*** [12] | Usually solitary | Usually solitary |
| **Key ddx of PG** | | ***SCC, BCC, amelanotic melanoma, bacillary angiomatosis*** [12] | | | |

### Special Differentials Worth Remembering

#### Lumps That Can Mimic Carcinoma ("The Great Mimickers")

These conditions are high yield because misdiagnosis has serious consequences:

| Condition | What It Mimics | How to Differentiate |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Fat necrosis*** | ***Breast carcinoma*** (painless lump, dimpling, nipple retraction, spiculated mass on MMG) [4][5] | History of ***trauma or breast reconstruction*** [5]; biopsy to confirm |
| ***Keratoacanthoma*** | ***SCC*** (rapidly growing skin nodule) [2] | ***Spontaneous regression in 2–3 months, central keratin crater*** [2]; but always excise |
| ***Sclerosing adenosis / radial scars*** | ***Breast carcinoma*** [4] | Pathological diagnosis; ***can mimic CA*** [4] → core biopsy required |
| ***Fibrocystic changes*** | Breast carcinoma (nodularity) | ***Cyclical*** changes related to menstrual cycle [4]; usually bilateral, upper outer quadrant |
| ***Phyllodes tumour*** | Fibroadenoma | ***Older age (> 40)***, larger, more rapid growth; ***can be malignant*** [4] |
| ***Adenoma*** | Breast carcinoma | ***Older age; can mimic CA*** [4]; biopsy required |
| ***Tuberculosis (cold abscess)*** | Lymphoma or metastatic LN | Non-tender, matted LN, constitutional symptoms; AFB stain, culture, TB PCR |

### Approach Summary: The "5-Question" DDx Framework

When faced with any lump, systematically ask yourself:

1. **What site is it in?** → Narrows to site-specific differentials
2. **What layer does it arise from?** → Epidermal, dermal, subcutaneous, deep (use mobility tests)
3. **Is it solid or cystic?** → Fluctuance, transillumination
4. **Is it vascular?** → Pulsatility, compressibility, bruit
5. **Is it benign or malignant?** → Growth rate, consistency, edge, fixation, skin changes, LN

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Differential Diagnosis of Localized Lump — Key Exam Points:**

1. **Use the layer-based approach**: the examination findings (mobility, skin attachment, buttonhole sign, slip sign, punctum) tell you which layer → which differential
2. ***Anterior neck lump DDx***: thyroid enlargement, lymphadenopathy, skin lumps, branchial cyst, thyroglossal duct cyst [3]
3. ***Groin lump DDx***: inguinal/femoral hernia, femoral artery aneurysm, saphenous varix, inguinal LN, lymphoma, lipoma, abscess, undescended testis, hydroceles [1]
4. ***Breast lump DDx***: fibroadenoma (mobile, rubbery), cyst (fluctuant), fibrocystic changes (cyclical), fat necrosis (mimics CA), carcinoma (hard, fixed), intraductal papilloma (bloody discharge), phyllodes (> 40y, can be malignant)
5. ***BCC vs SCC vs keratoacanthoma***: BCC = rolled edge, rodent ulcer, pigmented in Asians, rarely metastasises. SCC = everted edge, contact bleeding, ± LN. KA = volcano-like, central keratin crater, rapid growth then regression — but always excise to r/o SCC [6]
6. ***Fat necrosis and sclerosing adenosis mimic breast carcinoma*** clinically AND radiologically → must biopsy [4]
7. ***FNAC is useless for lymphoma*** — need excisional biopsy for architectural detail [11]
8. **Lymph node consistency**: ***Hard = solid malignancy. Firm/rubbery = lymphoma, chronic leukaemia. Soft = acute leukaemia, reactive*** [11]
9. ***Dermoid cyst DDx***: sebaceous cyst (punctum), lipoma (softer, mobile), and site-dependent (pilonidal, thyroglossal, craniopharyngioma) [7]
10. ***Ganglion***: most common soft tissue tumour of hands, ***dorsal wrist 70%***, transilluminant, ***never becomes malignant*** [10]
