## Complications of Diarrhoea

Complications of diarrhoea span a wide spectrum — from the immediate, life-threatening metabolic derangements of acute severe diarrhoea, through to the chronic nutritional and end-organ consequences of prolonged malabsorptive states. The key is to understand that complications arise not just from the diarrhoea itself (fluid/electrolyte/nutrient loss) but also from the **underlying cause** (e.g., toxic megacolon in IBD, HUS in EHEC) and from **treatment** (e.g., pouchitis after surgery, refeeding syndrome during nutritional rehabilitation). Let's work through each systematically.

---

### 1. Acute Complications of Diarrhoea

These are the complications that will kill a patient within hours to days if not recognised and treated.

#### 1.1 Dehydration and Hypovolaemic Shock

**Mechanism**: Diarrhoeal stool is approximately isotonic with plasma. Large-volume losses (especially in cholera, ETEC, VIPoma) deplete the extracellular fluid compartment → ↓intravascular volume → ↓cardiac preload → ↓cardiac output → tissue hypoperfusion → shock.

**Why children and elderly are most vulnerable**: Children have a higher body-surface-area-to-volume ratio → faster insensible losses; elderly have reduced renal concentrating ability, blunted thirst response, and often have pre-existing cardiovascular disease limiting compensatory reserve.

| Severity | Signs | Estimated Fluid Deficit |
|---|---|---|
| **Mild ( < 4%)** | Thirst only, no clinical signs [8] | < 40 mL/kg |
| **Moderate (4–6%)** | ***↑Capillary refill > 2s, tachypnoea, mildly ↓tissue turgor*** [8] | 40–60 mL/kg |
| **Severe (≥ 7%)** | ***Very delayed capillary refill, shock, deep/acidotic breathing, ↓↓tissue turgor*** [8] | ≥ 70 mL/kg |

***Clinical features of hypovolaemic shock: vasoconstriction leading to pallor, peripheral cyanosis, cold extremities, delayed capillary refill; empty peripheral veins; tachycardia; sweating.*** [13]

**Complications of shock include**: multi-organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute kidney injury (see below), and death if untreated.

#### 1.2 Electrolyte Disturbances

These are extremely high-yield for both clinical practice and exams.

##### A. Hypokalaemia

**Mechanism**: Stool K⁺ concentration is 30–80 mmol/L. Large-volume diarrhoea → massive extrarenal K⁺ loss. In chronic diarrhoea, secondary hyperaldosteronism (from volume depletion) further augments renal K⁺ wasting.

***Extrarenal K⁺ loss with diarrhoea: paired spot urine K⁺ < 20 mmol/L.*** [4]

- ***Acute diarrhoea: associated with acidosis (↓HCO₃⁻) and urine K < 20 mmol/L*** [4]
- ***Chronic diarrhoea / laxative abuse: associated with alkalosis (↑HCO₃⁻) and urine K < 20 mmol/L*** [4]

**Clinical consequences of hypokalaemia** (especially when K⁺ < 2.5 mmol/L):
- ***Muscular dysfunction: LL > UL proximal muscle weakness, myalgia, cramps, paralysis*** [11]
- ***GI dysfunction: ileus, abdominal distension, anorexia, vomiting, constipation*** [11] — paradoxically, hypokalaemia from diarrhoea can then cause ileus, creating a vicious cycle
- ***Rhabdomyolysis: intense myalgia, myoglobinuria, renal failure*** [11] — in normal muscle, K⁺ released during contraction mediates local vasodilation; with systemic hypoK, this vasodilatory response fails → muscle ischaemia → rhabdomyolysis
- ***Cardiac arrhythmia (esp when K⁺ < 2.0): ↓T wave flattening and ↑U wave amplitude, prolonged QT interval, variety of arrhythmias*** [11]
- ***Nephrogenic DI: usually late, only seen in chronic hypoK ( > 2–3 weeks)*** [11] — chronic hypokalaemia impairs aquaporin-2 insertion in collecting duct → inability to concentrate urine → polyuria, worsening dehydration

##### B. Metabolic Acidosis (Non-Anion-Gap / Hyperchloraemic)

**Mechanism**: Lower GI secretions (ileal, colonic) are rich in HCO₃⁻. Diarrhoeal loss of HCO₃⁻ → fall in plasma HCO₃⁻ → metabolic acidosis. The kidneys retain Cl⁻ to maintain electroneutrality → hyperchloraemia. This is a **normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA)**.

***Distinguishing diarrhoea from RTA (both cause NAGMA with hypoK)*** [11]:

| Parameter | ***Diarrhoea*** | ***Distal RTA*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Urine pH*** | ***Usually < 5.3*** | ***Always > 5.5*** |
| ***Urine AG*** | ***Negative (decreased)*** | ***Positive (increased)*** |
| ***Urine OG*** | ***Increased*** | ***Decreased*** |

[11]

**Why is the urine anion gap negative in diarrhoea?** In response to acidosis, the kidney appropriately increases ammonium (NH₄⁺) excretion. NH₄⁺ is excreted with Cl⁻ → unmeasured cation in urine → makes the urine anion gap negative. In distal RTA, the kidney **cannot** acidify urine or excrete NH₄⁺, so the urine AG remains positive.

**Consequences of severe metabolic acidosis** (pH < 7.1):
- ***Heart: ↓contractility, arrhythmias, ↓response to catecholamines*** [11]
- ***Vascular: arterial dilatation, ↓response to catecholamines*** [11]
- ***Respiratory: compensatory hyperventilation (Kussmaul breathing)*** [11]
- ***Metabolic: insulin resistance, hyperK (transcellular H⁺/K⁺ shift), ↓ATP synthesis*** [11]
- ***Cerebral: altered mental status, coma*** [11]

##### C. Metabolic Alkalosis (Contraction Alkalosis)

**Mechanism**: Chronic diarrhoea → volume depletion → secondary hyperaldosteronism → ↑H⁺ secretion in distal nephron + ↑HCO₃⁻ reabsorption in proximal tubule → metabolic alkalosis. Laxative abuse follows the same mechanism.

##### D. Hyponatraemia and Hypernatraemia

**Mechanism**: Diarrhoeal fluid is roughly isotonic. The resulting serum Na⁺ depends on what the patient drinks to replace losses:
- If they drink **hypotonic fluids** (plain water, dilute juice) → **hyponatraemia** (dilutional)
- If they **cannot drink** (altered consciousness, severe vomiting) → **hypernatraemia** (water deficit exceeds Na deficit)

##### E. Hypomagnesaemia

***GI causes of hypoMg: ↓intake, ↓absorption, malabsorption, chronic diarrhoea, intestinal resection.*** [4]

**Why hypoMg matters**: Mg²⁺ is a cofactor for Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase. HypoMg → impaired K⁺ repletion (refractory hypokalaemia) and impaired PTH secretion → secondary hypocalcaemia. You cannot fix the K⁺ until you fix the Mg²⁺.

##### F. Hypocalcaemia

In malabsorptive diarrhoea: fat malabsorption → ↓vitamin D absorption → ↓intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption → hypocalcaemia. Additionally, unabsorbed fatty acids bind Ca²⁺ in the lumen (saponification) → further Ca²⁺ loss. HypoMg compounds this by impairing PTH secretion and PTH end-organ responsiveness.

**Clinical features**: Perioral and acral paraesthesiae, carpopedal spasm, Trousseau's sign, Chvostek's sign, prolonged QT, seizures.

#### 1.3 Acute Kidney Injury (Pre-Renal)

**Mechanism**: Hypovolaemia from diarrhoea → ↓renal perfusion → pre-renal AKI. If prolonged → ischaemic damage to tubular epithelium → acute tubular necrosis (ATN), i.e., intrinsic renal disease.

**Key point**: ***Prolonged pre-renal disease will progress to become ATN*** [14]. Early, aggressive fluid resuscitation is the single most important intervention. ***Stop nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, ACEI/ARB).*** [14]

#### 1.4 Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS)

**Mechanism**: Complication specifically of **enterohaemorrhagic *E. coli* (EHEC, O157:H7)** and occasionally *Shigella*. Shiga toxin → endothelial damage in glomerular capillaries → platelet activation and fibrin deposition → microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) + thrombocytopenia + AKI.

**Triad**: (1) Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (schistocytes on blood film, ↑LDH, ↑bilirubin, ↓haptoglobin), (2) Thrombocytopenia, (3) AKI.

**Why antibiotics are contraindicated in EHEC**: Antibiotics may lyse bacteria → release more Shiga toxin → worsen HUS. Antimotility agents also prolong toxin contact with mucosa → increased risk.

<Callout title="HUS — A Preventable Complication" type="error">
HUS develops in approximately 5–10% of children with EHEC O157:H7 infection. The risk is INCREASED by antibiotic use and antimotility agents. Management is supportive: IV fluids, RBC/platelet transfusion as needed, dialysis for AKI. Plasma exchange is indicated for atypical HUS (complement-mediated) but NOT for typical Shiga-toxin HUS.

### 2. Complications of Specific Underlying Causes

#### 2.1 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)

##### A. Toxic Megacolon

***Total or segmental non-obstructive dilatation of colon ≥ 6 cm or caecum > 9 cm and the presence of systemic toxicity.*** [3]

- ***Much more common in UC*** [5] but can occur in Crohn's colitis, and in ***C. difficile and CMV colitis*** [5]
- ***Presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and mental changes*** [3]
- ***High risk of developing toxic megacolon as inflammatory process extends beyond mucosa to involve muscle layers of the colon*** [3] → muscle paralysis → massive dilatation

**Pathophysiology from first principles**: Severe transmural inflammation → destruction of myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus → loss of coordinated smooth muscle contraction → colonic atony and dilatation. Simultaneously, damaged mucosa loses its barrier function → bacterial toxins translocate freely into the bloodstream → systemic toxicity.

**Management** [5]:
- ***Close monitoring, resuscitation, complete bowel rest (NPO ± TPN), NGT decompression***
- ***IV steroids (not 5-ASA), broad-spectrum antibiotics***
- ***Avoid colonoscopy (risk of perforation) and anti-diarrhoea / antispasmodic drugs***
- ***Outcome: 50% responds to medical Rx, 50% require urgent colectomy (if not responding in 3–7 days)*** [5]

##### B. Perforation

***Most commonly occurs as a consequence of toxic megacolon.*** [3] ***Perforation with peritonitis is associated with high mortality.*** [3]

**Mechanism**: Progressive dilatation → wall tension increases (Laplace's law: T = P × r) → ischaemia of the wall → necrosis → perforation → faecal peritonitis.

##### C. Strictures and Intestinal Obstruction

***Occurs due to repeated episodes of inflammation or muscle hypertrophy.*** [3] ***Should be considered malignant until proven otherwise by endoscopy with biopsy.*** [3]

In Crohn's disease specifically [5]:
- ***Cause: chronic inflammation → mucosal thickening, scarring, adhesions → intestinal obstruction***
- ***S/S: partial (colicky abdominal pain) or frank IO***

##### D. Abscess and Fistula Formation (Crohn's Disease)

***Causes: transmural inflammation → sinus tracts*** [5]:
- ***Enteroenteric fistula: diarrhoea, malabsorption*** (short-circuiting of bowel segments)
- ***Enterovesical fistula: recurrent UTI, pneumaturia*** [5] (gas from bowel enters bladder)
- ***Enterovaginal fistula: feculent vaginal discharge*** [5]
- ***Abscess: palpable mass, localised peritonitis*** [5]

##### E. Perianal Disease (Crohn's Disease) [5]

- ***Anal fissures (20%): intense pain with defecation, can occur at atypical location (not midline)*** — in contrast to typical anal fissures which are almost always at the posterior midline
- ***Perianal fistula (20–30%): persistent anal pain, painful defecation, purulent discharge***
- ***Anorectal abscesses (~50%): severe, constant anal pain worsened by sitting/defecation***

##### F. Fulminant Colitis (UC)

***Patients present with > 10 stools per day, continuous bleeding, abdominal pain, distension and acute severe toxic symptoms including fever and anorexia.*** [3] This is the step before toxic megacolon — early recognition and aggressive IV steroid therapy is crucial.

##### G. Colorectal Cancer Risk [5]

***Chronic inflammation of colon → ↑risk of CA colon.*** [5] ***Can occur in both UC and Crohn's colitis.*** [5]
- ***Risk factors: ↑extent and ↑duration of colitis*** [5]
- ***Time frame: ~8–10 years after onset in extensive disease, ~10–15 years after onset in limited or left-sided disease*** [5]
- ***Surveillance colonoscopy*** is recommended starting 8 years after disease onset, with biopsies at regular intervals to detect dysplasia

##### H. Malnutrition in IBD [5]

***Cause: poor intake, protein-losing enteropathy, malabsorption.*** [5]
***S/S: weight loss, deficiency anaemias, coagulopathy, osteomalacia, hypocalcaemia.*** [5]

##### I. Post-Surgical Complications (UC — After Proctocolectomy + IPAA) [3]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Pouchitis*** | Inflammation of the ileal pouch (J-pouch). Most common complication of IPAA. ***Treated with metronidazole and ciprofloxacin.*** [3] |
| ***Pouch-vaginal / perineal fistula*** [3] | Breakdown of staple/suture line |
| ***Anastomotic stricture*** [3] | Fibrosis at the anastomotic site |
| ***Anastomotic dehiscence with sepsis*** [3] | Technical failure → faecal peritonitis |
| ***Sexual dysfunction / Infertility*** [3] | Damage to pelvic nerves during proctectomy; adhesions around fallopian tubes |

#### 2.2 Diverticulitis Complications [3][12]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Abscess (17%)*** [3] | Microperforation contained by pericolonic fat and mesentery → localised collection of pus | ***Persistent fever and abdominal pain despite 3 days of antibiotics***; may develop ***pyogenic liver abscess via portal circulation*** [3]. Management: ***percutaneous CT-guided drainage if ≥ 5 cm*** [12] |
| ***Fistula*** [3] | Inflammation erodes into adjacent organs | ***MC colovesical fistula → recurrent dysuria, pneumaturia, faecaluria*** [12]. Also colovaginal (vaginal faeces/flatus in post-hysterectomy patients), coloenteric, colocutaneous. |
| ***Obstruction*** [3] | Acute: pericolonic inflammation compresses lumen. Chronic: ***recurrent attacks → progressive fibrosis and scarring → intestinal strictures*** [3] | Partial → colicky pain; complete → acute LBO |
| ***Perforation*** [3] | ***Rupture of diverticular abscess or inflamed diverticulum into peritoneal cavity*** [3] → generalised purulent or faecal peritonitis | Classified by ***Hinchey classification*** [12]: Stage I (pericolic abscess, 0% mortality) → Stage IV (faecal peritonitis, 50% mortality) |
| ***Massive haemorrhage*** | ***Rupture of vasa recta*** across the dome of a diverticulum [12] | ***Painless massive PR bleeding*** [12]; most common cause of massive lower GI bleeding (30–50%) |

#### 2.3 Infectious Diarrhoea Complications

| Complication | Associated Organism | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **HUS** | EHEC (O157:H7), *Shigella* | Shiga toxin → endothelial damage → MAHA + thrombocytopenia + AKI (see above) |
| **Guillain-Barré syndrome** | *Campylobacter jejuni* | Molecular mimicry: anti-ganglioside antibodies against *Campylobacter* lipopolysaccharides cross-react with peripheral nerve gangliosides → acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy |
| **Reactive arthritis** | *Salmonella*, *Shigella*, *Campylobacter*, *Yersinia* | HLA-B27-associated immune reaction: bacterial antigens presented to T-cells → inflammatory arthritis (typically large joints of lower limbs), conjunctivitis, urethritis (Reiter's syndrome) |
| **Erythema nodosum** | *Yersinia*, *Campylobacter*, *Salmonella* | Immune-complex mediated panniculitis → tender red nodules on shins |
| **Intestinal perforation** | *Salmonella typhi* (typhoid), severe *C. difficile* | Typhoid: necrosis of Peyer's patches in terminal ileum → perforation (classically week 3). CDI: transmural necrosis in severe/fulminant disease. |
| **Chronic carriage** | *Salmonella typhi* | Bacteria persist in gallbladder (favoured by gallstones) → intermittent faecal shedding. Important for public health (e.g., "Typhoid Mary"). |
| **Amoebic liver abscess** | *Entamoeba histolytica* | Trophozoites invade colonic mucosa → enter portal venous system → seed in liver → abscess formation. Typically single, right lobe. "Anchovy sauce" pus on aspiration. |

#### 2.4 Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) Complications

SBS (from extensive bowel resection or disease) is a cause of chronic diarrhoea, but it also leads to a cascade of complications that are highly examinable [3][5][16]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Watery diarrhoea*** [16] | ***Reduction of absorptive surface area, decrease in intestinal transit time, SIBO, or malabsorbed bile salts in colon leading to bile acid diarrhoea (secretory)*** [16] |
| ***D-lactic acidosis*** [16] | ***Bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates in intact colon → D-lactate production (not L-lactate) → neurological syndrome: altered mental status, confusion to coma, slurred speech, seizures, ataxia*** [16]. Standard lactate assays measure L-lactate only → may miss D-lactic acidosis. |
| ***Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, K)*** [16] | ***Fat malabsorption → impaired absorption of vitamins dissolved in fat. Vitamin A = night blindness. Vitamin D = metabolic bone disease/rickets. Vitamin E = neuromuscular disorders, haemolysis. Vitamin K = bleeding tendency.*** [16] |
| ***Vitamin B12 deficiency*** [16] | ***Distal ileum is the primary site for B12-IF complex absorption*** [16]. Ileal resection → B12 malabsorption → macrocytic anaemia, neuropsychiatric dysfunction, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. |
| ***Electrolyte deficiency (Ca, Mg)*** [16] | ***HypoMg: Mg binds to unabsorbed fatty acids → lost in stool. HypoCa: secondary to vitamin D deficiency AND hypoMg (impairs PTH secretion).*** [16] Perioral paraesthesiae, carpopedal spasm, Trousseau/Chvostek signs. |
| ***Trace element deficiency (Zn, Cu, Se)*** [16] | ***Zinc = impaired intestinal absorption and growth. Copper = metabolic bone disease. Selenium = cardiomyopathy.*** [16] |
| ***Iron deficiency*** [16] | ***Inadequate absorption or GI bleeding from anastomotic ulcers*** [16] |
| ***Essential fatty acid deficiency*** [16] | ***Hair loss, fatty infiltration of liver, poor growth, poor wound healing*** [16] |
| ***Metabolic bone disease*** [16] | ***Primary due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D → osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, secondary hyperparathyroidism*** [16] |
| ***Oesophagitis / PUD*** [16] | ***Gastrin hypersecretion due to loss of inhibitory hormones (GIP, VIP) produced in proximal gut*** [16]. Managed with PPIs. |
| ***Gallstones*** [16] | ***Ileal resection interrupts enterohepatic circulation of bile acids → bile supersaturated with cholesterol. Bile stasis from absence of meals (on TPN) → ↓CCK-mediated gallbladder contraction → biliary sludge and pigmented gallstones.*** [16] |
| ***Calcium oxalate kidney stones*** [16] | ***Normally, dietary Ca binds oxalate in the gut lumen. In fat malabsorption, Ca binds preferentially to unabsorbed fatty acids → free oxalate is absorbed by the colon → filtered by kidneys → calcium oxalate stones.*** [16] Prevention: ***increased fluid intake, low oxalate diet, correction of metabolic acidosis with potassium citrate*** [16]. |
| ***TPN-associated complications*** [16] | ***Catheter-associated infection, mechanical failure (thrombosis/occlusion), hepatic steatosis and cholestasis*** [16] |
| ***SIBO*** [5] | ***Loss of IC valve → ↓transit time + loss of barrier to colonic bacteria refluxing into SB → bacterial overgrowth → deconjugation of bile acids (worsens fat malabsorption) + B12 consumption + gas production (bloating, flatulence)*** [16] |

<Callout title="Gallstones AND Kidney Stones in SBS — Understand the Logic">
Both gallstones and kidney stones are classic complications of ileal resection, but the mechanisms are completely different. **Gallstones**: disrupted enterohepatic circulation → cholesterol-supersaturated bile. **Kidney stones**: unabsorbed fatty acids bind calcium → free oxalate absorbed by colon → hyperoxaluria → calcium oxalate stones. Note that if the colon is also resected, oxalate stones do NOT form (no colon to absorb oxalate) but gallstones still occur.
</Callout>

### 3. Chronic / Nutritional Complications of Prolonged Diarrhoea

These develop insidiously in patients with chronic malabsorptive or inflammatory diarrhoea.

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Protein-energy malnutrition** | Malabsorption + increased catabolism + reduced intake → negative nitrogen balance | ***Weight loss, ↓muscle bulk, fatigue, malaise*** [5]. ***Hypoproteinaemia → bowel oedema inhibits GI function, wound oedema inhibits healing, prevents normal cardiovascular response to shock. Muscle wasting → respiratory muscle weakness → respiratory failure and chest infections.*** [8] |
| **Iron-deficiency anaemia** | Chronic GI blood loss (IBD, CRC) + malabsorption of iron (coeliac, Crohn's — duodenum/jejunum is the site of iron absorption) | Microcytic hypochromic anaemia, angular stomatitis, glossitis, koilonychia |
| **Megaloblastic anaemia** | B12 deficiency (terminal ileum disease/resection) or folate deficiency (jejunal disease, e.g., coeliac) | Macrocytic anaemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, glossitis, neuropathy (B12) |
| **Osteoporosis / Osteomalacia** | Vitamin D + Ca²⁺ malabsorption → ↓bone mineralisation. Steroid use in IBD further accelerates bone loss. | Low-trauma fractures, bone pain, proximal myopathy (osteomalacia) |
| **Peripheral neuropathy / Subacute combined degeneration** | B12 deficiency → impaired myelin synthesis in dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts | Loss of vibration/proprioception (dorsal columns), spastic paraparesis (corticospinal tracts), peripheral neuropathy |
| **Coagulopathy** | Vitamin K malabsorption → deficiency of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X (all synthesised in the liver and require vitamin K as cofactor for gamma-carboxylation) | Easy bruising, prolonged PT/INR, mucosal bleeding |

#### Refeeding Syndrome

When a malnourished patient with chronic diarrhoea is refed (enterally or parenterally), there is a risk of **refeeding syndrome** [17]:

***Pathogenesis*** [17]:
- ***Starvation → ↓body stores of PO₄, K, Mg, vitamins***
- ***Refeeding → ↑blood glucose → ↑insulin → ↑cellular uptake of PO₄, K, Mg***
- ***Precipitate acute hypophosphataemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia***

***Consequences*** [17]:
- ***Muscle weakness: ↓contractility, myalgia, tetany, rhabdomyolysis, respiratory failure***
- ***CVS: ↓contractility, heart failure, arrhythmia***
- ***GI: diarrhoea (due to atrophy of intestinal mucosa), liver derangement***
- ***Neurological: tremors, paraesthesia, delirium, seizures, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (B₁ deficiency)***

***Management: reduce nutritional support and correct hypoPO₄, hypoK, hypoMg.*** [17] Always give **thiamine (B₁)** before or concurrent with refeeding to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy.

### 4. Complications Related to Treatment of Diarrhoea

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Loperamide in inflammatory diarrhoea** | Toxic megacolon, prolonged infection | Slows transit → toxins/organisms in contact with mucosa longer → transmural damage |
| **Antibiotics** | *C. difficile* infection | Disrupts normal colonic flora → loss of colonisation resistance → CDI overgrowth |
| **Chronic PPI use** | CDI, SIBO, microscopic colitis, hypoMg | Acid suppression → altered gut microbiome; impaired Mg absorption |
| **Total proctocolectomy + IPAA** | ***Pouchitis (most common), pouch-vaginal fistula, anastomotic stricture, sexual dysfunction, infertility*** [3] | Pouchitis: bacterial stasis in neorectum → inflammation. Others: surgical complications. |
| **Chronic TPN** | ***Catheter-associated infection, hepatic steatosis and cholestasis, mechanical failure*** [16] | Central line infection; hepatotoxicity from lipid emulsions and absence of enteral stimulation of bile flow |
| ***Enteral feeding*** [8] | ***GI: distension, cramping, N/V, diarrhoea/constipation, intestinal ischaemia. Metabolic: dehydration, electrolyte disturbance (esp hyperNa), hyperglycaemia. Mechanical: malpositioning, tube blockage. Infectious: aspiration pneumonia, bacterial contamination, PEG site infection, peritonitis.*** [8] | Hyperosmolar feeds draw water into lumen → osmotic diarrhoea; rapid infusion overwhelms absorptive capacity; aspiration from reflux |
| **Anti-TNFα therapy (IBD)** | ***Reactivation of TB/HBV, lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancer*** [3] | Immunosuppression → inability to contain latent infections or surveil for malignant cells |
| **Corticosteroids (IBD)** | Osteoporosis, DM, Cushing's, adrenal suppression, infection, avascular necrosis | Multi-system effects of chronic glucocorticoid excess |
| **AZA/6-MP** | Myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, lymphoma | Purine analogue toxicity; check TPMT/NUDT15 before starting |

### 5. Summary Table — Complications by Time Course

| Timeframe | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Immediate (hours–days)** | Dehydration, hypovolaemic shock, hypokalaemia (arrhythmia, ileus, rhabdomyolysis), metabolic acidosis, AKI (pre-renal), HUS (EHEC) |
| **Short-term (days–weeks)** | Toxic megacolon, perforation, intestinal ischaemia, sepsis/bacteraemia, Guillain-Barré syndrome (post-Campylobacter), reactive arthritis, refeeding syndrome (during recovery) |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Diarrhoea">

1. **Dehydration → shock → AKI**: the immediate life threat. Resuscitate aggressively. Pre-renal AKI progresses to ATN if prolonged.

2. **Hypokalaemia**: stool K⁺ loss. Consequences = arrhythmia (ECG: flat T, tall U, prolonged QT), muscle weakness, ileus, rhabdomyolysis, nephrogenic DI. Cannot correct K⁺ without correcting Mg²⁺ first.

3. **NAGMA**: HCO₃⁻ loss in stool. Distinguish from RTA by urine pH ( < 5.3 in diarrhoea vs > 5.5 in distal RTA) and urine AG (negative in diarrhoea, positive in RTA).

4. **HUS**: EHEC complication. Triad: MAHA + thrombocytopenia + AKI. Antibiotics and antimotility agents are CONTRAINDICATED.

5. **Toxic megacolon**: colon ≥ 6 cm + systemic toxicity. Avoid colonoscopy, antimotility agents, anticholinergics. IV steroids + antibiotics. 50% need colectomy.

6. **Crohn's complications**: strictures → obstruction; transmural inflammation → fistulae (enteroenteric, enterovesical, enterovaginal) + abscesses; perianal disease.

7. **Short bowel syndrome complications**: D-lactic acidosis, gallstones (disrupted enterohepatic circulation), calcium oxalate kidney stones (free oxalate absorbed by colon), fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, B12 deficiency, metabolic bone disease.

8. **Refeeding syndrome**: in malnourished chronic diarrhoea patients — refeeding triggers insulin surge → cellular K/PO₄/Mg uptake → acute hypoPO₄/hypoK/hypoMg. Give thiamine first.

9. **CRC risk in IBD**: increases with extent and duration of colitis. Surveillance colonoscopy from 8 years.

Prevention: Start feeding at low rate (10-20 kcal/kg/day), increase gradually over 4-7 days. Give thiamine (vitamin B1) BEFORE or concurrent with refeeding (prevent Wernicke's).

(4) Free perforation - full-thickness necrosis leads to peritonitis. (5) Perianal disease (fissures at atypical locations, fistulae, abscesses) - transmural inflammation of the rectum extends to perianal tissues. Key point: UC is mucosal/submucosal only so does NOT typically cause fistulae or abscesses (except toxic megacolon which involves deeper layers)."
