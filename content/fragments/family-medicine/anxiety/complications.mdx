## Complications of Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders are often perceived by the public — and sometimes even by clinicians — as "just worry." This is a dangerous misconception. Untreated or poorly managed anxiety disorders carry significant morbidity across **psychiatric, medical, functional, and social domains**. The complications arise from the chronic biological burden of sustained autonomic and neuroendocrine activation, from maladaptive behavioural patterns (avoidance, substance use), and from the downstream effects of functional impairment on the patient's life.

Let's work through these systematically.

---

### 1. Psychiatric Complications

#### 1.1 Comorbid Depression — The Most Important Complication

This is the single most clinically significant complication. ***Depression (MADD or comorbid MDD, a/w ↑severity, functional impairment and ↑duration of illness)*** [1].

**Why does anxiety lead to depression?**

The two conditions share:
- **Neurochemical substrates**: Both involve serotonergic and noradrenergic dysfunction. Chronic anxiety depletes 5-HT reserves over time. The same 5-HT transporter polymorphisms predispose to both.
- **HPA axis dysregulation**: Chronic cortisol elevation from sustained anxiety → hippocampal atrophy (cortisol is neurotoxic to hippocampal CA1 neurons) → impaired stress regulation and memory consolidation → depressive cognitions.
- **Cognitive overlap**: Chronic worry about the future (anxiety) gradually shifts to rumination about past failures and helplessness (depression) as the patient's functional capacity declines and they feel increasingly unable to cope.
- **Learned helplessness**: Persistent anxiety with failed attempts to control it → sense of uncontrollability → hopelessness → depression.

***Early onset a/w more protracted course and usually a/w comorbid depression*** [1].

**Clinical significance**: Comorbid anxiety + depression is associated with:
- Greater symptom severity than either disorder alone
- Longer duration of illness
- Poorer treatment response
- ↑Suicidal ideation and attempts (see below)

<Callout title="Exam Alert" type="error">
Always screen for depression in every anxiety patient (PHQ-9 alongside GAD-7). Comorbid depression transforms the prognosis and may necessitate more aggressive treatment. ***Note content of rumination: depressive pt tends to brood self-critically on previous events and circumstances, but GAD pt tends to worry about possible future events*** [3] — if the content shifts from future-oriented worry to past-oriented self-blame, the patient may be developing depression.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Suicidal Ideation and Behaviour

Anxiety disorders independently increase suicide risk, and this risk is dramatically amplified when comorbid with depression.

- **Panic disorder** is particularly associated with suicidal ideation — the sheer terror of repeated panic attacks, the feeling of "going crazy," and the sense that life is unlivable during attacks drives despair.
- ***Impact: ↓QoL, functioning and ↑all-cause mortality (esp cardiovascular disorders)*** [21].
- GAD patients with comorbid depression have suicide attempt rates approaching those of depression alone.

**Why anxiety increases suicide risk from first principles**: Chronic anxiety → functional impairment → social isolation → hopelessness → loss of reasons for living. Additionally, the *agitation* component of anxiety may lower the threshold for impulsive suicidal acts — a patient with depression alone may have suicidal thoughts but lack the energy to act; add anxiety-driven agitation and the risk of action increases.

#### 1.3 Substance Use Disorders

***Other associations: SA, OCD, PTSD, chronic physical illness, medically unexplained symptoms*** [1].

**The self-medication hypothesis**: Anxious patients discover that alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, or other substances temporarily relieve their distress. This negative reinforcement drives escalating use.

- **Alcohol**: Acts on GABA-A receptors → anxiolysis. But chronic use → GABA-A receptor downregulation → tolerance → need for higher doses → dependence → withdrawal anxiety worse than baseline → vicious cycle. ***Panic disorder: 37% with lifetime Hx of major depression... Others: alcohol (self-medication)*** [5].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Same GABA-A mechanism. Iatrogenic dependence when prescribed long-term is a significant problem, particularly in Hong Kong where benzodiazepine overuse in primary care is well-documented.
- **Cannabis**: Initially anxiolytic at low doses (CB1 receptor activation in amygdala) but at higher doses or chronic use → ↑anxiety, paranoia. Also associated with amotivational syndrome.

***Potential complications of somatoform presentations: substance use disorders in attempt to ↓distress, e.g., narcotic analgesics, benzodiazepines*** [22].

#### 1.4 Development of Other Anxiety Disorders

Anxiety disorders breed more anxiety disorders. A patient with one anxiety disorder is at significantly elevated risk of developing another:

- ***Associated comorbidities: other anxiety disorders (social phobia 23.2–34.4%, specific phobia 24.5–35.1%, panic disorder 22.6–23.5%)*** [1].
- **Panic disorder → Agoraphobia**: This is the classic progression. Repeated unexpected panic attacks → anticipatory anxiety about having further attacks → avoidance of situations where attacks occurred or escape would be difficult → progressively restricted activities → full-blown agoraphobia. ***Often develops into agoraphobia as an attempt to avoid panic attacks and their consequences*** [5].
- **GAD → Panic disorder**: Escalating, uncontrollable worry → panic attacks. Though unexpected panic attacks are unusual in GAD, the boundary can blur.

In children: ***Nearly 2/3 expected to disappear in 3–5y, but ~1/3 of them will have other categories of anxiety disorders at follow-up*** [23].

#### 1.5 Obsessive-Compulsive Features

While OCD is now classified separately from anxiety disorders, anxious patients can develop **obsessional features** — particularly checking behaviours, reassurance-seeking, and repetitive mental acts. These represent the brain's attempt to achieve certainty and control in the face of intolerable uncertainty.

### 2. Medical / Physical Complications

#### 2.1 Cardiovascular Disease

***Impact: a/w functional impairment and ↑CVS mortality*** [1].

***↑all-cause mortality (esp cardiovascular disorders)*** [21].

**Why chronic anxiety damages the cardiovascular system — First Principles:**

1. **Chronic sympathetic activation** → sustained ↑heart rate + ↑blood pressure → ↑cardiac workload → accelerated atherosclerosis, endothelial damage
2. **HPA axis dysregulation** → chronic cortisol elevation → insulin resistance → metabolic syndrome (visceral obesity, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia) → atherogenic milieu
3. **Inflammation**: Chronic stress → ↑pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP) → endothelial inflammation → plaque formation and instability
4. **Platelet activation**: Stress hormones → ↑platelet reactivity → ↑thrombotic risk
5. **Autonomic imbalance**: ↓Heart rate variability (a marker of ↓vagal tone and ↑sympathetic dominance) → arrhythmia risk
6. **Behavioural mediators**: Anxious patients are more likely to smoke, be sedentary, eat poorly, and have poor medication adherence

Meta-analyses show that GAD is associated with a **26% increased risk of coronary heart disease events** and a **48% increased risk of cardiac death** independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

#### 2.2 Chronic Pain and Somatic Symptom Burden

Chronic anxiety drives **central sensitisation** — the nervous system becomes hyperexcitable and amplifies pain signals. This manifests as:

- Chronic tension-type headache (sustained muscle contraction of temporalis, frontalis, cervical muscles)
- Fibromyalgia (central sensitisation → widespread pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction)
- Irritable bowel syndrome (gut-brain axis dysregulation; visceral hypersensitivity)
- Chronic musculoskeletal pain (shoulder, back, jaw/TMJ)

The pathophysiology: Chronic cortisol and noradrenaline → ↓descending inhibitory pain modulation (serotonergic/noradrenergic pathways in periaqueductal grey and rostroventromedial medulla) → ↑pain perception.

#### 2.3 Gastrointestinal Disorders

The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication system. Chronic anxiety:
- **↑Gut permeability** ("leaky gut") via cortisol-mediated effects on tight junctions
- **Alters gut microbiome** composition (dysbiosis)
- **Exacerbates functional GI disorders**: IBS, functional dyspepsia, GERD

#### 2.4 Immune Dysfunction

Chronic cortisol elevation → **immunosuppression** (↓T-cell function, ↓NK cell activity, ↓antibody production) → ↑susceptibility to infections, impaired wound healing, and potentially ↑cancer risk (though the latter remains debated).

Paradoxically, chronic low-grade inflammation also co-occurs (cortisol resistance at the immune cell level) → autoimmune exacerbation.

#### 2.5 Sleep Disorders

- **Insomnia**: Both a symptom and a complication. Chronic insomnia from anxiety → sleep deprivation → impaired prefrontal function → ↓top-down amygdala inhibition → ↑anxiety. This is a self-perpetuating cycle.
- **Obstructive sleep apnoea** may be exacerbated by weight gain from sedentary lifestyle or medication side effects (mirtazapine, pregabalin).

### 3. Functional and Psychosocial Complications

#### 3.1 Occupational Impairment

- ↓Concentration and ↓decision-making capacity → poor work performance
- Avoidance behaviour → absenteeism, inability to meet deadlines
- Social anxiety → inability to attend meetings, present, or network
- **Economic burden**: GAD is one of the psychiatric disorders associated with the highest number of lost work productivity days. In Hong Kong, where competitive work culture is the norm, this creates a particularly vicious cycle of ↑stress → ↑anxiety → ↓performance → ↑stress.

#### 3.2 Academic Impairment

Highly relevant in the Hong Kong context. Anxiety disorders in adolescents and young adults → poor academic performance → missed educational opportunities → long-term socioeconomic consequences.

#### 3.3 Social and Relationship Impairment

- Avoidance of social situations → social isolation → loneliness → ↑depression
- Irritability and emotional dysregulation → interpersonal conflict
- Reassurance-seeking → strain on relationships (partners/family become exhausted)
- Sexual dysfunction (both anxiety-driven and medication-induced) → relationship strain

#### 3.4 Agoraphobic Restriction

In severe cases (especially panic disorder with agoraphobia), patients may become progressively **housebound**. This represents one of the most devastating functional outcomes:
- Complete loss of independence
- Inability to work, shop, or attend medical appointments
- Total dependence on family/caregivers
- Profound social isolation

### 4. Treatment-Related Complications (Iatrogenic)

#### 4.1 SSRI-Related Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Risk Factor |
|---|---|---|
| Serotonin syndrome | Excess serotonergic stimulation when combined with MAOIs, tramadol, triptans | Drug interactions; inadequate washout period |
| Hyponatraemia (SIADH) | ↑ADH secretion → dilutional hyponatraemia | Elderly, concurrent diuretics, low BMI |
| GI bleeding | ↓Platelet 5-HT → impaired aggregation | Concurrent NSAIDs, anticoagulants, elderly |
| Suicidal ideation | Paradoxical activation in early treatment (first 2 weeks) — energy returns before mood improves, or initial anxiety worsening provokes despair | Young adults ( < 25 years), early treatment phase |
| Discontinuation syndrome | Abrupt cessation → serotonergic withdrawal (dizziness, nausea, "brain zaps," insomnia, irritability) | Paroxetine and venlafaxine (shortest half-lives) |
| Sexual dysfunction | 5HT2A-mediated ↓dopamine in mesolimbic pathway + spinal 5-HT effects | Persistent; may last beyond discontinuation |

#### 4.2 Benzodiazepine-Related Complications

- **Dependence and withdrawal**: The most significant iatrogenic complication. Physical dependence develops within 2–4 weeks of regular use. Withdrawal can include rebound anxiety (worse than baseline), insomnia, tremor, and in severe cases **withdrawal seizures** (life-threatening).
- **Cognitive impairment**: Long-term BZD use is associated with impaired memory consolidation, ↓processing speed, and possibly ↑dementia risk (controversial but concerning).
- **Falls and fractures**: Particularly in the elderly — sedation + muscle relaxation + impaired coordination → falls → hip fractures → significant morbidity/mortality.
- **Road traffic accidents**: Psychomotor impairment equivalent to legal alcohol intoxication.
- ***Paradoxical reaction ( < 1%): esp in ↓IQ, neurological disease, extremes of age and with Hx of aggression → may have unexpected ↑aggressive or impulsive behaviour*** [19].

#### 4.3 Unnecessary Investigations and Procedures

***Unnecessary invasive procedures with iatrogenic complications*** [22].

When anxiety presents primarily with somatic symptoms (as it often does in Hong Kong), patients may undergo repeated investigations — CT scans, endoscopies, cardiac catheterisations, lumbar punctures — searching for an organic cause that doesn't exist. Each investigation carries its own risks:
- Radiation exposure (cumulative from repeated CT scans)
- Procedural complications (perforation, bleeding, infection)
- False-positive results → further unnecessary investigations (the investigation cascade)
- Reinforcement of illness beliefs (each new test confirms the patient's belief that something must be physically wrong)

***Ix: judicious → false-positive results may lead to unnecessary invasive investigations and risks*** [24].

### 5. Course and Prognosis — Framing Complications in Context

Understanding the natural history helps us understand *why* complications are so common:

| Feature | GAD | Panic Disorder |
|---|---|---|
| ***Course*** | ***Usually chronic fluctuating, with ↓rates of remission in short/medium term*** [1] | ***Tends to be recurrent and chronic with fluctuating anxiety and depression*** [21] |
| ***Prognosis*** | ***Generally poor if disease lasts > 6mo, with only 60% having complete recovery after 12y and 50% of those recovering having subsequent relapses*** [1] | ***Remission occurs in 64% at 2y with mean time to remission of 5.7mo*** [21] |
| ***Impact*** | ***A/w functional impairment and ↑CVS mortality*** [1] | ***↓QoL, functioning and ↑all-cause mortality (esp cardiovascular disorders)*** [21] |
| ***Good prognostic factors (panic disorder)*** | — | ***Female gender, no ongoing life stressors, ↓initial attack frequency, subthreshold panic, no major depression, no agoraphobia, no personality disorders*** [21] |

For **specific phobia**: ***Those lasting > 1y generally remain the same after 5y, but help-seeking may occur during episodes of secondary depression*** [25].

For **social anxiety disorder**: ***1/2–2/3 will respond to Tx, with ~50% of responders achieving full remission*** [25].

For **childhood anxiety**: ***Nearly 2/3 expected to disappear in 3–5y, but ~1/3 of them will have other categories of anxiety disorders at follow-up*** [23]. ***Selective mutism prognosis is often poor, with 58% remission rate at 13y. Associated with later development of phobia, social anxiety, ↑risk for depression, substance misuse in unresolved cases*** [23].

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Most important complication**: Comorbid depression — affects up to 60–70% of GAD patients over lifetime; associated with ↑severity, ↑duration, ↑functional impairment, and ↑suicide risk.

**Cardiovascular mortality**: Independently elevated in both GAD and panic disorder. Mechanism: chronic sympathetic activation + cortisol-driven metabolic syndrome + inflammation + platelet hyperreactivity.

**Substance misuse**: Self-medication with alcohol and benzodiazepines is extremely common; creates a vicious cycle of tolerance → withdrawal anxiety → escalating use.

**Panic → Agoraphobia**: The classic progression — avoidance of panic-associated situations progressively restricts the patient's world.

**Prognosis of GAD**: Only 60% recover after 12 years; 50% of those relapse. Associated with ↑CVS mortality and functional impairment.

**Iatrogenic**: BZD dependence and unnecessary investigations/procedures are significant preventable complications.

**Childhood**: 1/3 develop other anxiety disorders at follow-up; selective mutism has 58% remission at 13 years.
