## Complications of Hand / Wrist / Elbow Conditions

Complications are the consequences of either the **disease itself** (if untreated or poorly controlled) or of the **treatment** (surgical or medical). Understanding complications from first principles means tracing them back to the underlying pathology — if you understand *why* cartilage is destroyed in septic arthritis, you understand *why* the complication is permanent joint stiffness. Below, we systematically cover complications condition by condition, then the cross-cutting complications that apply across multiple conditions (e.g. compartment syndrome, CRPS).

---

### 1. Disease Complications — By Condition

#### 1.1 Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Thenar muscle wasting*** [2] | Chronic compression → axonal loss of median nerve motor fibres → denervation atrophy of abductor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis | Loss of thumb opposition and abduction → inability to grip, pinch, or oppose thumb. **Irreversible** if denervation exceeds ~6–12 months because motor endplates degenerate |
| Permanent sensory loss | Prolonged ischaemia → Wallerian degeneration of sensory axons | Numbness in lateral 3.5 digits → loss of fine touch discrimination; patients drop objects, burn fingers without noticing |
| "Ape hand" deformity | Loss of thenar opposition → thumb falls back into the plane of the palm | Thumb cannot oppose to other fingers → functional hand disability |

**Treatment complications of carpal tunnel release** [2]:
- ***Persistent CTS symptoms (inadequate release)*** — if the flexor retinaculum is not completely divided, residual compression persists; the most common cause of "failed" CTR.
- ***Nerve injury: palmar cutaneous branch*** — this small branch of the median nerve crosses the operative field and can be transected during open CTR → painful neuroma or numbness over the thenar eminence.
- ***Vascular injury: superficial palmar arch*** — the arch lies just deep to the retinaculum; overzealous deep dissection can lacerate it → haematoma and ischaemia to the digital arteries.
- **Pillar pain** — post-operative pain at the thenar and hypothenar eminences (the "pillars") where the retinaculum was attached. Due to altered load transmission after the retinaculum is divided. Usually self-limiting over weeks.
- **Wound infection** and **scar tenderness** — as with any surgical procedure.
- **Recurrence** — rare ( < 5%) but may occur from scar tissue reformation or incomplete initial release.

<Callout title="Why Timing Matters in CTS" type="error">
The key teaching point: **irreversible thenar wasting** is the most feared complication of CTS. Once axonal loss progresses beyond ~6–12 months, the motor endplates at the neuromuscular junction undergo fibrotic degeneration and cannot be reinnervated even if the nerve is subsequently decompressed. This is why ***sensory/motor deficit and axonal loss on NCS are urgent surgical indications*** [2].
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Cubital Tunnel Syndrome

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Intrinsic hand muscle wasting | Ulnar nerve denervation → atrophy of interossei, hypothenar muscles, medial 2 lumbricals |
| Claw hand deformity | Loss of lumbrical/interosseous function (MCP flexion + IP extension) → unopposed MCP hyperextension + IP flexion by long flexors. Paradoxically **less severe** in cubital tunnel than in Guyon's canal (ulnar paradox — FDP 4/5 also denervated in high lesion) |
| Permanent sensory loss (medial 1.5 digits) | Axonal degeneration of ulnar sensory fibres |
| Grip and pinch weakness | Interossei (finger ab/adduction) and adductor pollicis (key pinch) denervated |

**Treatment complications**:
- ***Anterior transposition*** [2] — risk of devascularising the ulnar nerve during mobilisation; haematoma; medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve injury (numbness over medial forearm).
- Medial epicondylectomy — instability of the elbow's medial column if too much bone is removed.

#### 1.3 Lateral and Medial Epicondylitis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Chronic pain / treatment failure | The pathology is **tendinosis** (degenerative), not inflammatory → response to conservative treatment can be slow (6–12 months); ~10–20% become chronic despite treatment |
| Tendon rupture | Repeated steroid injections weaken the collagen matrix → ↑ risk of ECRB/common extensor tendon tear. This is why injections should be limited to ≤ 3 per site |
| Recurrence after surgery | Incomplete debridement or failure to address the underlying biomechanical cause (e.g. poor ergonomics) |
| ***Associated ulnar nerve neuropathy*** (medial) [2] | In medial epicondylitis, inflammation at the common flexor origin is in direct proximity to the ulnar nerve → concurrent ulnar neuritis |

#### 1.4 De Quervain's Tenosynovitis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Chronic stenosing tenosynovitis | If the repetitive mechanical trigger is not eliminated, the 1st compartment sheath continues to thicken → persistent pain despite treatment |
| Post-injection skin depigmentation / fat atrophy | Steroid injection → local lipocyte atrophy + melanocyte suppression → visible skin dimple and whitening at injection site. More noticeable in darker skin tones |
| Superficial radial nerve injury (post-surgery) | The nerve passes directly over the 1st compartment. During surgical release, it can be transected → Wartenberg's syndrome (iatrogenic neuritis: numbness/dysaesthesia over dorsal thumb/1st web space) |

#### 1.5 Trigger Finger

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Fixed flexion deformity (Green's Grade IV)*** [2] | Prolonged locking → secondary contracture of the PIP joint capsule and volar plate; even after A1 pulley release, the PIP may remain flexed |
| Tendon bowstringing (post-surgical) | If the A2 pulley is inadvertently released during A1 pulley surgery, the flexor tendon lifts away from the phalanx during flexion → reduced mechanical efficiency and visible bowstringing |
| Digital nerve injury (post-surgical) | The digital nerves lie immediately lateral to the flexor sheath at the A1 pulley level → risk during percutaneous or open release |
| Steroid-related tendon weakening | Repeated intrasheath steroid → collagen degradation → tendon rupture (rare but documented) |

#### 1.6 Scaphoid Fracture

***Complications*** [2]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical consequence |
|---|---|---|
| ***Avascular necrosis (AVN) (~30%)*** | The scaphoid's blood supply enters distally (dorsal branch of radial artery) and travels retrograde towards the proximal pole → ***higher risk if more proximal fracture*** [2] because the proximal fragment is cut off from its blood supply | Proximal pole becomes necrotic → sclerotic on XR → collapse → secondary OA |
| ***Scaphoid non-union advanced collapse (SNAC)*** | ***Progressive arthritis due to prolonged non-union*** [2]. The scaphoid is mainly surrounded by articular cartilage (no periosteal blood supply for callus formation) → ***relies on primary bone healing*** [2] → difficult to achieve union if not absolutely immobilised | Predictable pattern of wrist OA: radioscaphoid → capitolunate → pancarpal arthritis. End-stage → wrist fusion |
| Malunion | Fracture heals in an abnormal position (e.g. flexed "humpback" deformity) → altered carpal mechanics | Restricted wrist ROM, pain, secondary OA |

#### 1.7 Rheumatoid Arthritis — Hand/Wrist Complications

RA is a systemic disease, but the hand/wrist bears the brunt of local joint destruction. Complications arise from **pannus formation** eroding cartilage, bone, and soft tissues [3][5]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Joint deformities*** [5]: ulnar deviation, swan-neck, boutonnière, Z-thumb, volar subluxation | Pannus → ligament/capsule destruction → tendon imbalance → deformity. E.g. swan-neck: volar plate laxity at PIP → unopposed extensor pull → PIP hyperextension + compensatory DIP flexion |
| ***Tendon rupture*** [3] | Tenosynovitis weakens tendons from within; bony spicules at the DRUJ or Lister's tubercle can abrade tendons. The most common is **extensor tendon rupture** (EPL after Colles' fracture; EDC to ring/little finger from dorsal DRUJ osteophyte — the "Vaughan-Jackson" lesion) |
| ***Nerve palsy: CTS, PIN palsy*** [3][5] | Synovial proliferation within the carpal tunnel compresses the median nerve; synovitis around the elbow compresses the posterior interosseous nerve → finger drop |
| ***Trigger finger*** [5] | Flexor tenosynovitis → nodule formation → A1 pulley stenosis |
| ***Cervical myelopathy from C1/2 instability*** [3] | Pannus erodes the transverse ligament of C1 → atlantoaxial subluxation → spinal cord compression. A life-threatening complication — always check lateral C-spine in flexion before general anaesthesia in RA patients |
| ***Joint dislocation*** [5] | Ligament destruction at MCP/wrist → subluxation/dislocation |
| Secondary OA | End-stage RA → cartilage destruction → secondary degenerative changes on top of inflammatory disease |

#### 1.8 Gout — Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Chronic tophaceous gout*** [4] | Persistent hyperuricaemia → MSU crystal deposition in soft tissues → ***gouty tophi (extensor surface of fingers, hands, forearm, elbows, Achilles tendons, helix of ear)*** [4]. Tophi cause progressive joint destruction and functional impairment |
| ***Tophus complications*** [4]: ***ulceration, infection, inflammation mimicking dactylitis*** | Tophi thin the overlying skin → ulceration discharging whitish gritty material (crystalline urate). Ulcerated tophi are portals of entry for bacteria → secondary infection. Inflammation around a tophus can mimic dactylitis |
| ***Urate renal stones, uric acid nephropathy*** [4] | Hyperuricaemia → urate crystallisation in renal collecting system → stones; chronic urate deposition in renal interstitium → nephropathy |
| ***Progressive joint destruction*** [4] | Chronic crystal-induced inflammation → cartilage and bone erosion → deformity and disability |
| Recurrent flares with shortening intercritical periods [4] | Untreated: ***2nd flare ≤ 1 year (62%), ≤ 2 years (78%), ≤ 10 years (93%)*** [4]. Flares become ***increasingly prolonged, disabling, polyarticular and may be associated with fever*** |

#### 1.9 Septic Arthritis / Flexor Sheath Infection

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Permanent cartilage destruction*** | Bacterial proteases + neutrophil-derived enzymes (collagenases, elastases) degrade the cartilage matrix within **days**. Cartilage is avascular and cannot regenerate → irreversible joint damage. This is why septic arthritis is a ***rheumatological emergency*** [3] |
| Secondary OA | Post-infective joint damage leads to early-onset degenerative changes |
| Joint ankylosis / stiffness | Inflammatory granulation tissue → fibrous adhesions → loss of ROM |
| Osteomyelitis | Infection extends from the joint into underlying bone, especially in children (where the metaphyseal blood supply communicates with the joint) |
| Tendon necrosis (flexor sheath infection) | Pus within the closed tendon sheath → ↑ pressure → ischaemic necrosis of the flexor tendons → loss of finger flexion |
| Spread to deep spaces — ***horseshoe abscess*** | The radial bursa (thumb FPL sheath) and ulnar bursa (little finger FDS/FDP sheath) communicate at the wrist in the Parona space → infection can spread between thumb and little finger |
| Amputation | End-stage: necrotic tendon, destroyed joint, uncontrolled infection → may require digital or ray amputation |

#### 1.10 Ganglion Cyst

***Complications*** [6][13]:
- ***Nerve impingement*** — a ganglion at the wrist can compress the median nerve (carpal tunnel), ulnar nerve (Guyon's canal), or posterior interosseous nerve → pain, weakness, sensory loss.
- ***Post-excision recurrence (up to 50%)*** [13] — because the stalk or connection to the joint capsule may regenerate or not be fully excised.
- ***Wound complications, injury to neighbouring structures*** [13] — e.g. radial artery, extensor tendons, sensory nerve branches.
- The cyst itself **never becomes malignant** [2].

---

### 2. Cross-Cutting Complications

These complications can occur across multiple conditions, especially trauma-related ones:

#### 2.1 Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)

> ***Always keep regional pain syndrome in mind for persistent burning pain in hand following injury, trivial or severe*** [1]

**Etymology**: "complex" = multifaceted; "regional" = localised to a body region; "pain syndrome" = chronic pain state.

**Types**:
- CRPS Type I (reflex sympathetic dystrophy): no definable nerve lesion.
- CRPS Type II (causalgia): follows a defined nerve injury.

**Pathophysiology**: Not fully understood. After injury (fracture, surgery, even minor trauma), an aberrant inflammatory and sympathetic nervous system response develops:
1. Initial injury → nociceptor sensitisation + neurogenic inflammation.
2. Peripheral sensitisation → central sensitisation (spinal cord wind-up).
3. Sympathetic-afferent coupling → sympathetic nervous system activity maintains pain.
4. Cortical reorganisation → chronic pain state with trophic changes.

**Clinical features** — three phases:
| Phase | Features |
|---|---|
| Acute (0–3 months) | Burning pain disproportionate to injury; red, warm, oedematous hand; ↑ sweating; rapid nail/hair growth |
| Dystrophic (3–9 months) | Pain persists; cool, cyanotic skin; stiff joints; brawny oedema; osteoporosis on XR |
| Atrophic ( > 9 months) | Irreversible trophic changes: smooth shiny skin, fixed contractures, severe osteoporosis, muscle atrophy |

**When to suspect**: ***persistent burning pain in hand following injury, trivial or severe*** [1] — the pain is **out of proportion** to the original insult.

**Management**: Early recognition is crucial. Multidisciplinary approach: physiotherapy (graded motor imagery, mirror therapy), analgesics (pregabalin/gabapentin for neuropathic component), vitamin C prophylaxis (500 mg daily after wrist fractures may reduce incidence), and psychological support.

<Callout title="CRPS After Wrist Fracture — Prevention">
CRPS is listed as a rare but important complication under Murtagh's framework [1]. It occurs in ~5–25% of distal radius fractures. Evidence suggests that **vitamin C 500 mg daily for 50 days** starting from the day of fracture may reduce the risk. Tight casts should be avoided (↑ swelling → ↑ pain → ↑ CRPS risk).
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Compartment Syndrome

***Compartment syndrome*** [14]:

**Definition**: ↑ intra-compartmental pressure due to bleeding, oedema, or inflammation → ↓ capillary perfusion → muscle ischaemia → necrosis.

**Pathophysiology** [14]:
1. Trauma/surgery → bleeding/oedema within a closed fascial compartment.
2. Intra-compartmental pressure rises → exceeds capillary perfusion pressure.
3. Muscle ischaemia → further oedema (vicious cycle) → necrosis within 6–8 hours.
4. Late: fibrosis → contracture (→ ***Volkmann's contracture*** in forearm).

**In the upper limb**: can occur in the forearm (3 compartments: volar, dorsal, mobile wad) and hand (10 compartments: 4 dorsal interosseous, 3 volar interosseous, thenar, hypothenar, adductor pollicis).

**Diagnosis** [14]:
- Clinical: ***6 Ps of ischaemia (paralysis and pulselessness are late signs)***; most sensitive sign = ***excessive pain on passive stretching*** [14].
- Measurement: intra-compartmental pressure > 30 mmHg (or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP) [14].

**Management** [14]:
- Remove constrictive dressings (cast, bandages).
- ***Emergency fasciotomy of all compartments*** [14].
- Leave skin incisions open for re-inspection after 48 hours.
- Post-op: monitor RFT, CK (rhabdomyolysis).

#### 2.3 Volkmann's Contracture

***Volkmann's contracture*** [14][2]:

The **end-stage** consequence of missed/untreated compartment syndrome in the forearm.

**Mechanism** [14]: ***brachial artery injury*** (classically from a supracondylar fracture in children) → ***ischaemic necrosis of forearm flexors*** → fibrosis → shortening of flexor muscles → ***claw-like deformity*** with fixed flexion of wrist and fingers, forearm pronation, and elbow flexion [2].

**Classic association**: ***supracondylar fracture in children*** [2] — the proximal fragment can lacerate or compress the brachial artery.

**Clinical picture** [2]: thumb adduction, wrist flexion, MCP extension, IP flexion, forearm pronation, elbow flexion.

**Prevention**: vigilant neurovascular monitoring after any elbow fracture; immediate cast splitting if compartment syndrome is suspected; early fasciotomy.

#### 2.4 Stiffness and Adhesions

Stiffness is a universal complication of any hand/wrist/elbow condition that involves:
- **Immobilisation** (casting, splinting) → joint capsule contracture, tendon adhesions.
- **Inflammation** (RA, septic arthritis, post-surgical) → fibroblastic proliferation → adhesion formation.
- **Tendon surgery** → adhesions between repaired tendon and surrounding sheath → restricted gliding.

**Why the hand is particularly vulnerable**: the hand has a very high density of closely packed tendons, joints, and pulleys within a small space. Even small amounts of oedema or scar tissue can dramatically restrict motion. This is why **early mobilisation** after any hand surgery or injury is paramount.

---

### 3. Treatment-Related Complications (Iatrogenic)

| Treatment modality | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Steroid injection (any site)** | Tendon rupture | Steroid inhibits collagen synthesis → tendon weakening (especially if injected directly into tendon substance rather than peritendinous) |
| | Skin depigmentation / fat atrophy | Local melanocyte and lipocyte suppression |
| | Hyperglycaemia | Systemic absorption of corticosteroid → hepatic gluconeogenesis ↑. Important to warn DM patients |
| | Infection (rare) | Introduction of bacteria through needle puncture; aseptic technique essential |
| ***Carpal tunnel release*** [2] | ***Persistent CTS, palmar cutaneous nerve injury, superficial palmal arch injury*** | See 1.1 above |
| ***Trigger finger release*** | Digital nerve injury, flexor tendon bowstringing | Digital nerves immediately lateral to A1 pulley; A2 pulley inadvertent release |
| ***De Quervain's release*** | Superficial radial nerve injury (Wartenberg's) | Nerve crosses the surgical field |
| ***Cubital tunnel surgery*** [2] | Ulnar nerve devascularisation, medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve injury | Nerve mobilisation disrupts vascular supply; MABC nerve runs in operative field |
| **Prolonged casting** | Joint stiffness/contracture, disuse muscle atrophy, pressure sores, CRPS | Immobility → capsular fibrosis; muscle disuse → atrophy; tight cast → ↑ pressure → CRPS |
| **NSAIDs (chronic)** | GI ulceration, renal impairment, CVS events | COX-1 inhibition → ↓ mucosal protection; renal prostaglandin inhibition → vasoconstriction; prothrombotic COX-2 relative excess |
| ***Allopurinol*** | ***Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (DRESS/SJS/TEN)*** | HLA-B*5801-mediated T-cell activation → severe cutaneous adverse reaction. Prevalence of HLA-B*5801 ~6–8% in Chinese/Hong Kong population |
| **DMARDs (methotrexate)** | Marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis | Folate antagonism → bone marrow toxicity; hepatocyte damage; immune-mediated pulmonary inflammation |

### 4. Functional Complications and Impact

The hand is the primary tool for interacting with the world. Any complication affecting the hand has outsized functional impact [2]:

| Domain | Specific functional loss | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| ***ADL — Upper limb*** [2] | ***Buttoning, combing, chopstick use*** | Ask the patient to perform these tasks |
| Grip and pinch | Inability to grip objects (jar, door handle) or perform key pinch (turning a key) | Dynamometer, key grip test |
| Fine motor | Dropping objects, difficulty writing, unable to pick up coins | Practical tests: writing, undo button |
| Occupational | Inability to perform work duties (manual workers, surgeons, musicians) | Occupational therapy assessment |
| Psychological | Frustration, depression, anxiety — especially if dominant hand affected | Screen for depression (***Murtagh's masquerade: depression*** [1]) |
| Social | Inability to shake hands, embarrassment from deformity, loss of independence | Social work referral if needed |

> ***Hand dominance*** is a critical part of the history [2] — complications affecting the dominant hand have far greater functional impact.

---

### 5. Summary Table — Complications by Condition

| Condition | Disease complications | Treatment complications |
|---|---|---|
| **CTS** | Thenar wasting (irreversible), permanent sensory loss, ape hand | ***Persistent CTS, palmar cutaneous nerve injury, superficial palmar arch injury*** [2] |
| **Cubital tunnel** | Intrinsic hand wasting, claw hand, sensory loss | Nerve devascularisation, MABC nerve injury |
| **Lateral epicondylitis** | Chronic pain, tendon rupture (from repeated injections) | Recurrence post-surgery |
| **De Quervain's** | Chronic stenosing tenosynovitis | Superficial radial nerve injury (Wartenberg's) |
| **Trigger finger** | ***Fixed flexion deformity (Grade IV)*** [2] | Digital nerve injury, tendon bowstringing |
| **Scaphoid fracture** | ***AVN (~30%), SNAC wrist, malunion*** [2] | Screw migration, non-union despite fixation |
| **RA hand** | ***Deformities, tendon rupture, CTS, C1/2 instability*** [3][5] | DMARD toxicity (MTX), surgical complications |
| **Gout** | ***Tophi (ulceration, infection), renal stones, joint destruction*** [4] | Allopurinol hypersensitivity, colchicine toxicity |
| **Septic arthritis** | ***Cartilage destruction, secondary OA, osteomyelitis, ankylosis*** | Inadequate washout → persistent infection |
| **Flexor sheath infection** | Tendon necrosis, horseshoe abscess, amputation | Stiffness from adhesions |
| **Ganglion** | ***Nerve impingement*** [13] | ***Recurrence (up to 50%), wound Cx, injury to neighbours*** [13] |
| **Any fracture/trauma** | ***Compartment syndrome, Volkmann's contracture, CRPS*** [1][14] | Cast complications (stiffness, pressure sores) |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **CTS**: most feared complication = ***irreversible thenar wasting*** from axonal loss. Surgical complications: ***persistent CTS (inadequate release), palmar cutaneous nerve injury, superficial palmar arch injury*** [2].

2. **Scaphoid fracture**: ***AVN (~30%, higher in proximal fractures)*** because blood supply is retrograde; ***SNAC wrist*** from non-union [2].

3. **RA hand**: progressive deformities (ulnar deviation, swan-neck, boutonnière), ***tendon rupture*** (Vaughan-Jackson lesion), ***CTS***, and ***C1/2 instability*** (always check before GA) [3][5].

4. **Gout**: untreated → ***tophaceous gout*** with progressive joint destruction, tophi complications (ulceration, infection), and ***renal disease*** (urate stones, nephropathy) [4].

5. **Septic arthritis**: ***cartilage destruction within days*** — the defining reason it is a rheumatological emergency [3].

6. ***CRPS***: ***always keep in mind for persistent burning pain in hand following injury, trivial or severe*** [1]. Disproportionate pain + trophic changes after injury. Prevention: vitamin C, avoid tight casts.

7. ***Volkmann's contracture***: end-stage of missed compartment syndrome in the forearm. Classic scenario: supracondylar fracture → brachial artery injury → ischaemic necrosis of flexor compartment → claw deformity [2][14].

8. **Steroid injection complications** apply across all conditions: tendon weakening/rupture, skin depigmentation, hyperglycaemia in DM, infection. Limit to ≤ 3 per site.

9. ***Allopurinol hypersensitivity (DRESS/SJS/TEN)***: screen HLA-B*5801 in Chinese patients before starting. Mortality ~25%.

10. **Functional impact**: always assess ***ADL (buttoning, combing, chopstick use)*** and ***hand dominance*** [2] — hand complications disproportionately affect quality of life.
