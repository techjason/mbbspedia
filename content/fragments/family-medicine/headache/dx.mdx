## Diagnostic Criteria for Primary Headache Syndromes

The **International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3, 2018)** provides the gold-standard diagnostic criteria for all headache types. Primary headaches are clinical diagnoses — there is no blood test or imaging study that "confirms" them. The criteria exist to ensure diagnostic consistency and, crucially, to ensure that secondary causes have been appropriately considered.

---

### A. Tension-Type Headache (TTH) — ICHD-3 Criteria [3][4]

TTH is divided into **episodic** (infrequent or frequent) and **chronic** forms.

**Episodic TTH** (the most common):
1. At least **10 episodes** of headache occurring on < 15 days/month for ≥ 3 months
2. Lasting **30 minutes to 7 days**
3. At least **2 of the following 4** characteristics:
   - Bilateral location
   - Pressing / tightening (non-pulsating) quality — "band-like"
   - Mild or moderate intensity
   - **Not aggravated** by routine physical activity (walking, climbing stairs)
4. **Both** of the following:
   - No nausea or vomiting
   - No more than one of photophobia or phonophobia
5. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

> **Why these criteria work from first principles**: TTH arises from pericranial muscle tension, NOT trigeminovascular activation. So there is no pulsating quality (no vascular component), no worsening with physical activity (no meningeal sensitization), and no nausea/photophobia/phonophobia (no brainstem sensitization). These "negative" features distinguish it from migraine.

**Chronic TTH**: ≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months. Mild nausea is permitted but not moderate/severe nausea or vomiting.

---

### B. Migraine — ICHD-3 Criteria [3][4]

***Migraine patient defined as: ≥ 2 attacks with aura OR ≥ 5 attacks without aura*** [4].

#### Migraine Without Aura (80%)
1. At least **5 attacks** fulfilling criteria 2–4
2. Headache attacks lasting **4–72 hours** (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)
3. Headache has at least **2 of the following 4**:
   - Unilateral location
   - Pulsating quality
   - Moderate or severe pain intensity
   - Aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity
4. During headache, at least **1 of the following**:
   - Nausea and/or vomiting
   - Photophobia AND phonophobia
5. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

> ***Mnemonic: POUND*** — **P**ulsating, 4–72 h**O**urs, **U**nilateral, **N**ausea, **D**ebilitating [2].

#### Migraine With Aura (20%)
1. At least **2 attacks** fulfilling criteria 2 and 3
2. One or more fully reversible aura symptoms:
   - Visual (most common — 99%), sensory (31%), speech/language (18%), motor (6%), brainstem, retinal
3. At least **3 of the following 6**:
   - ≥ 1 aura symptom spreads gradually over ≥ 5 minutes
   - ≥ 2 aura symptoms occur in succession
   - Each individual aura symptom lasts 5–60 minutes
   - ≥ 1 aura symptom is unilateral
   - ≥ 1 aura symptom is positive (scintillations, pins and needles)
   - Aura accompanied or followed within 60 minutes by headache
4. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

> **Why must aura spread gradually?** Cortical spreading depression (CSD) propagates at 3–5 mm/min across the cortex. This slow march produces a visual aura that "builds" over minutes — unlike a vascular event (stroke/TIA) where onset is maximal within seconds. If a patient describes instantaneous onset of visual symptoms, think vascular, not migraine.

---

### C. Cluster Headache — ICHD-3 Criteria [4][6]

1. At least **5 attacks** fulfilling criteria 2–4
2. Severe or very severe **unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain** lasting **15–180 minutes** (untreated)
3. Either or both of the following:
   - **At least 1 ipsilateral autonomic sign**: conjunctival injection/lacrimation, nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea, eyelid oedema, forehead/facial sweating, miosis/ptosis (Horner's)
   - A sense of **restlessness or agitation**
4. Occurring with a frequency between one every other day and 8 per day
5. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

> **Key distinguisher from migraine**: cluster headache patients are **restless and agitated** (pacing, rocking); migraine patients **lie still** in a dark room. This reflects the different underlying neurobiology — in cluster headache, hypothalamic activation produces an "arousal" state, whereas in migraine, central sensitization makes all stimulation painful.

---

### D. Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) — ACR 1990 Classification Criteria [10][24]

Diagnosis requires **≥ 3 of the following 5 criteria**:

| Criterion | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ***1. Age of onset ≥ 50 years*** | GCA virtually never occurs < 50yo — the granulomatous process targets age-degenerated arterial walls |
| ***2. New headache*** | New-onset or new-type headache in a previously headache-free elderly patient |
| ***3. Temporal artery abnormality on clinical examination*** | Tender, thickened, or reduced pulsation reflects vessel wall inflammation and possible thrombosis |
| ***4. Elevated ESR ( > 50 mm/h)*** | Systemic inflammation; IL-6 mediated acute phase response |
| ***5. Abnormal findings on biopsy of temporal artery*** | Panarteritis with granulomatous inflammation, giant cells, intimal thickening, fragmentation of internal elastic lamina [10][24] |

<Callout title="Start Steroids Before Biopsy!" type="error">
***Treatment is started upon presumed clinical diagnosis even despite negative initial investigations*** [10]. Biopsy should be performed within 1–2 weeks but must NOT delay corticosteroids — delay risks permanent blindness from AAION. Biopsy remains positive for at least 2 weeks after steroid initiation because granulomatous inflammation resolves slowly.
</Callout>

### E. Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) — Modified Dandy Criteria [5]

1. Signs and symptoms of ↑ICP (headache, papilloedema, TVOs, CN6 palsy, pulsatile tinnitus)
2. No localizing neurological signs (except CN6 palsy — a false localizing sign)
3. ***Normal brain parenchyma on neuroimaging*** with:
   - ***Small or normal ventricles ('slit' ventricles)***
   - ***Enlarged sella filled with CSF (empty sella sign)***
   - ***± MRV to rule out secondary ↑ICP due to CVST*** [5]
4. ***LP: ↑ opening pressure ( > 25 cmH₂O in adults) but normal CSF constituents*** [5]
5. No other identifiable cause of ↑ICP

> **Why MR venography is essential**: CVST can perfectly mimic IIH (headache + papilloedema + ↑ICP with "normal" brain parenchyma). The ONLY way to distinguish them is to look at the venous sinuses. Always order MRV before labelling someone with IIH.

## Investigation Modalities — Key Findings and Interpretations

### Guiding Principles [12][25]

- ***Plain CT is the imaging of choice in most acute settings*** [12]
- ***IV contrast for abscess, metastases, tumour, venous sinus thrombosis and angiography*** [12]
- ***MRI as a problem-solving tool for delineating tumours, epilepsy and demyelinating diseases*** [12]

---

### 1. History and Examination (The Most Important "Investigation")

***Key history*** [9]:
- ***A full description of the pain including a pain analysis should be obtained, especially associated symptoms***
- ***It is useful to get the patient to prepare a diary with a grid plotting the relative pain intensity with time of day***
- ***Family history, psychosocial history and drug history***

***Key examination*** [9]:
- ***Use the basic tools of trade: thermometer, sphygmomanometer, pen torch, diagnostic set with ophthalmoscope and stethoscope***
- ***Inspect the head, temporal arteries and eyes***
- ***Areas to palpate include the temporal arteries, the facial and neck muscles, the cervical spine and sinusitis, teeth and TMJs***
- ***Look for signs of meningeal irritation and papilloedema***
- ***A mental state examination is advisable***
- ***Perform a basic neurological examination***

> A thorough history and focused neurological examination will correctly classify ~95% of headache presentations. Investigations are reserved for red-flag features or diagnostic uncertainty.

---

### 2. Blood Tests

| Test | When to Order | Key Findings | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***FBE (Full Blood Examination)*** [9] | Baseline screening; suspected infection, anaemia, haematological malignancy | ↑WCC → infection; ↓Hb → anaemia; ↑platelets → reactive thrombocytosis (GCA) or essential thrombocythaemia | Anaemia itself can cause headache (↑cerebral blood flow for O₂ delivery compensation) |
| ***ESR / CRP*** [9][10][24] | Suspected GCA, infection, vasculitis | ***GCA: characteristically very high ESR (reaching 100 mm/h) with ↑CRP*** [10]; NcNc anaemia, reactive thrombocytosis | ESR > 50 is one of the ACR criteria for GCA; CRP rises and falls faster than ESR → useful for monitoring treatment response |
| **Glucose** | Suspected hypoglycaemia, DM | ↓glucose → hypoglycaemia headache; ↑glucose → DM (risk factor for stroke) | Hypoglycaemia causes headache via compensatory cerebral vasodilation |
| **Coagulation screen (PT/aPTT/INR)** | On anticoagulation, suspected coagulopathy, pre-LP | Prolonged → ↑bleeding risk; must correct before LP | Coagulopathy predisposes to ICH and SDH [14] |
| **TFT** | Suspected hypothyroidism | ↑TSH, ↓fT4 → hypothyroidism | Hypothyroidism a/w headache (possibly via ↑CSF pressure) |
| **24h urine fractionated metanephrines / plasma metanephrines** | Suspected phaeochromocytoma (paroxysmal headache + sweating + palpitations + HTN) | ***24h urine fractionated metanephrines: Sens 98% Spec 98%*** [20] | Elevated metanephrines confirm catecholamine-secreting tumour |

---

### 3. Neuroimaging

This is the workhorse investigation for secondary headache.

#### A. Non-Contrast CT Brain (NCCT) [12][25][26]

**When**: ***First-line imaging for acute headache*** [12]. Specifically:
- ***Thunderclap headache*** [12]
- ***Red flags: new-onset, Hx of CA/immunodeficiency, coagulopathy or on anticoagulation, with mental status changes, with meningitic features, with focal neurology, progressive deterioration*** [12]
- Head trauma with indications (Canadian CT Head Rule or New Orleans Criteria) [27]

**Why CT first?** CT is fast (~1 minute scan time), widely available, excellent at detecting acute blood (which appears hyperdense/white) and bony pathology. It is the most time-efficient way to answer the critical question: "Is there blood?"

| Condition | CT Findings | Why It Looks That Way |
|---|---|---|
| ***SAH*** | ***Hyperdensity in basal cisterns around circle of Willis (65%) or Sylvian fissure (30%)*** [13] | Fresh blood is hyperdense due to high protein content of haemoglobin; blood pools in dependent cisterns by gravity |
| **ICH** | Hyperdense lesion within brain parenchyma; ***common sites: pons, cerebellum, putamen, thalamus*** (hypertensive) or lobar (CAA) [14] | Acute blood = hyperdense; oedema surrounding = hypodense; ***attenuation changes with time: acute = hyperdense → subacute = isodense → chronic = hypodense*** [26] |
| **EDH** | ***Biconvex (lentiform) extra-axial hyperdensity that does not cross sutures*** [12][25] | Arterial blood strips dura from inner skull table; extent limited by suture attachments because dura (endosteal layer) crosses through sutures; shape is biconvex because high-pressure arterial blood pushes the dura inward |
| **SDH** | Crescent-shaped extra-axial collection that crosses sutures but not the midline falx | Venous blood spreads freely in the subdural space (no dural attachments to sutures); crescent-shaped because it conforms to brain surface; acute = hyperdense, subacute = isodense (the dangerous "invisible" SDH), chronic = hypodense |
| **Hydrocephalus** | Dilated ventricles ± periventricular hypodensity (transependymal CSF seepage) | CSF accumulation distends ventricles; pressure forces CSF across ependyma into periventricular white matter |
| **Mass lesion** | Hypodense/isodense/mixed density lesion ± surrounding oedema ± midline shift | Tumour tissue may be of varying density; oedema is vasogenic (from BBB disruption) → hypodense |

**Sensitivity of CT for SAH** is time-dependent:
- **Within 6 hours**: > 98% (nearly 100% with modern scanners) — if CT is truly negative at < 6h, some guidelines now allow discharge without LP in low-risk patients
- **At 12 hours**: ~93%
- **At 24 hours**: ~86%
- **At 1 week**: ~50%
- **After 2 weeks**: may be completely normal

> This is why LP remains essential when CT is negative but clinical suspicion for SAH persists — especially if presentation > 6h from onset.

#### B. Contrast CT Brain [12][25][28]

**When**: Suspected intracranial infection, tumour, inflammatory lesion, vascular pathologies.

| Condition | Findings | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Brain abscess** | Ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding oedema | Contrast enhancement indicates BBB disruption; ring = capsule wall of abscess which is highly vascularized |
| **Tumour** | ***Normal brain tissue does not enhance (due to BBB). Enhancement indicates: (1) outside BBB (e.g. meningioma — homogeneously enhancing) or (2) disruption of BBB (e.g. high-grade tumours, inflammation)*** [28] | Low-grade tumours may not enhance; high-grade gliomas and metastases typically show avid ring or heterogeneous enhancement |
| **CTA** | Opacified vessels showing aneurysm, dissection, stenosis, or thrombus | ***CT angiography: use of rapid injection of large IV bolus of contrast to opacify vessels*** [26]; identifies aneurysm location for SAH surgical planning |

#### C. MRI Brain [12][25][29]

**When**: MRI is a ***problem-solving tool*** — used for clinically stable patients when CT is non-diagnostic or when greater soft tissue detail is needed.

***MRI is more sensitive than CT except in acute haemorrhage, bony lesions, and calcific lesions*** [12].

| Sequence | What It Shows Best | Clinical Use in Headache |
|---|---|---|
| **T1-weighted** | Anatomy (CSF = dark, fat = bright). **T1 + gadolinium contrast**: enhancing lesions | Tumour delineation, meningeal enhancement (meningitis, leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, intracranial hypotension) |
| **T2-weighted / FLAIR** | Oedema, gliosis, demyelination (bright). CSF is bright on T2, dark on FLAIR | White matter lesions, MS plaques, vasogenic oedema around tumours |
| ***DWI (Diffusion-Weighted Imaging)*** | ***Restricted diffusion = bright on DWI, dark on ADC*** | ***Early ischaemic stroke (within minutes!)*** [29] — DWI is the most sensitive early indicator; also bright in abscess (restricted diffusion of pus) |
| **SWI / GRE** | Microbleeds, old blood products (dark "blooming") | Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (lobar microbleeds), chronic hypertensive microbleeds (deep), cavernomas |
| ***MRV (MR venography)*** | Venous sinus patency | ***CVST: filling defect in venous sinus; empty delta sign (superior sagittal sinus involvement)*** [13]; essential to exclude before diagnosing IIH [5] |
| **MRA** | Arterial anatomy without iodinated contrast | Aneurysm detection, arterial dissection (intramural haematoma), stenosis |

**MRI in intracranial hypotension** [5]:
- ***Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement (due to ↑blood volume as compensatory mechanism via Monro-Kellie doctrine)***
- ***Dilated veins, sagging brain*** (brain "droops" from loss of CSF buoyancy)
- ***± pocket of CSF at site of leakage***

**MRI in IIH** [5]:
- ***Normal brain parenchyma with small/normal ventricles ('slit' ventricles)***
- ***Enlarged sella filled with CSF (empty sella sign)***
- Flattening of posterior globe, distension of optic nerve sheaths

**Comparison: CT vs MRI in stroke** [26][29]:

| Feature | CT | MRI |
|---|---|---|
| Radiation | Yes | No |
| Examination time | ~1 minute | ~20 minutes |
| Availability | Good | Fair |
| ***Sensitivity for infarct*** | ***Poor*** (especially < 24h; ~48% < 1 day) | ***Good*** (DWI positive within minutes) |
| ***Sensitivity for haemorrhage*** | ***Good*** | ***Good*** (SWI/GRE) |

> **Why is CT poor for early infarct?** Cytotoxic oedema in early ischaemia causes only subtle density changes — mild hypodensity with loss of grey-white junction. These changes take hours to become apparent on CT. MRI DWI detects restricted water diffusion from cellular swelling within minutes.

---

### 4. Lumbar Puncture (LP) and CSF Analysis

LP is performed when you need to analyze CSF directly. **Always do CT before LP if raised ICP is suspected** — LP in the presence of a mass lesion risks transtentorial herniation (removing CSF from below creates a pressure gradient that "sucks" brain tissue downward through the tentorium).

| Indication in Headache | Key CSF Findings | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **SAH (CT-negative)** | ***Bloody CSF, xanthochromia (12h to 12d), persistent ↑RBC > 100,000, ↑protein*** [13] | Xanthochromia = yellow discoloration from bilirubin (formed by in-vivo breakdown of haemoglobin in CSF — takes ≥ 12h). This distinguishes true SAH from traumatic tap (where RBC count drops between tubes and there is no xanthochromia) |
| **Meningitis / encephalitis** | ↑WCC (neutrophilic in bacterial, lymphocytic in viral/TB), ↑protein, ↓glucose (bacterial/TB), +ve culture/PCR | Bacterial: turbid, WCC > 1000, protein > 1g/L, glucose < 40% serum. TB: ***↑OP 18–30cmH₂O, ↑protein 1–5g/L, ↓glucose < 2.5mmol/L, lymphocytic pleocytosis 100–500/μL, AFB smear Sens 30–60%*** [23] |
| ***IIH*** | ***↑ opening pressure ( > 25 cmH₂O) but normal constituents*** [5] | Confirms ↑ICP; normal protein, glucose and cells exclude infection and malignancy |
| **Intracranial hypotension** | ↓ opening pressure ( < 6 cmH₂O) | Low pressure confirms CSF leak |
| **Carcinomatous meningitis** | ↑protein, ↓glucose, lymphocytic pleocytosis, +ve cytology for malignant cells | CSF cytology has ~50% sensitivity on first sample → repeat if suspicious |

> **LP timing for SAH**: Must wait ≥ 12 hours after symptom onset before performing LP for SAH workup. This allows enough time for bilirubin to form (xanthochromia), which is the distinguishing feature from a traumatic tap.

---

### 5. Vascular Imaging

| Modality | Indication | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|
| **CTA (CT Angiography)** | SAH (identify aneurysm), suspected dissection, suspected CVST | Aneurysm seen as contrast-filled outpouching at arterial bifurcation; dissection shows intimal flap or tapered occlusion; CVST shows filling defect |
| **MRA (MR Angiography)** | Non-invasive alternative to CTA; aneurysm screening, dissection | Intramural haematoma in dissection appears as crescent-shaped bright signal on T1 fat-sat |
| ***DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography)*** | Gold standard for cerebral aneurysms; when CTA/MRA equivocal | Definitive identification of aneurysm morphology and vascular anatomy for surgical planning. ***Now mainly therapeutic rather than purely diagnostic*** (coiling of aneurysms) [26] |
| ***Colour Doppler USG of head and neck*** | Suspected GCA when biopsy not immediately available; carotid stenosis | ***Halo sign*** in GCA — hypoechoic ring around temporal artery representing vessel wall oedema |

---

### 6. Temporal Artery Biopsy [10][24]

- **When**: Suspected GCA (new headache in > 50yo + ↑ESR + temporal artery abnormalities)
- **What it shows**: ***Panarteritis with mixed infiltrates with fragmentation of intima and necrosis of media ± giant cells*** [10]
- **Pitfall**: May be **falsely negative** due to **patchy ("skip") inflammation** — a 2cm or longer biopsy segment is recommended; contralateral biopsy if first is negative but suspicion remains high
- **Timing**: Should be done within 1–2 weeks of starting steroids (histological changes persist for at least 2–4 weeks after steroid initiation)

---

### 7. Ophthalmological Assessment

| Finding | Technique | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Papilloedema*** | ***Fundoscopy with direct ophthalmoscope*** — swollen disc with blurred edges, dilated superficial capillaries, NO spontaneous venous pulsation of CRV [16] | Indicates ↑ICP → immediate CT/MRI to r/o SOL and hydrocephalus → LP if imaging normal |
| **Visual fields (VF)** | Confrontation VF, formal perimetry | Enlarged blind spot (acute papilloedema), bitemporal hemianopia (pituitary adenoma compressing chiasm [17]), altitudinal defect (AAION [10]) |
| **Intraocular pressure (IOP)** | Tonometry | ↑IOP > 21mmHg → acute angle-closure glaucoma |
| **RAPD (Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect)** | Swinging flashlight test | Present in optic neuritis (the affected eye has ↓pupillary constriction when light swung to it); absent in papilloedema (bilateral equal involvement) |

---

### 8. Condition-Specific Investigations — Summary by Diagnosis

| Suspected Diagnosis | Key Investigations | Findings |
|---|---|---|
| ***SAH*** | ***CT brain → LP (if CT -ve) → CTA/MRA → DSA*** [13] | CT: hyperdensity in basal cisterns; LP: xanthochromia; CTA/DSA: aneurysm |
| ***ICH*** | ***Urgent NCCT brain*** [14]; vascular imaging if non-hypertensive aetiology suspected (***no HT, age < 40–45, atypical location, CT abnormality***) [14] | CT: parenchymal hyperdensity ± IVH/hydrocephalus ± mass effect |
| ***EDH*** | ***CT brain*** [11][25] | Biconvex hyperdensity not crossing sutures ± skull fracture |
| ***SDH*** | ***CT brain*** [11][25] | Crescent hyperdensity (acute) or hypodensity (chronic) crossing sutures |
| ***Meningitis*** | CT brain → LP (CSF analysis, Gram stain, culture, PCR) [21][23] | Turbid CSF, ↑WCC, ↑protein, ↓glucose, +organism |
| ***CVST*** | ***CT brain (can be normal!) → MRI brain + MR venogram*** [13] | ***Empty delta sign on contrast CT; filling defect on MRV*** |
| ***GCA*** | ***Urgent ESR/CRP, FBE → temporal artery biopsy*** [10][24] | ***Very high ESR; biopsy: granulomatous arteritis ± giant cells*** |
| ***IIH*** | ***MRI brain (normal parenchyma, slit ventricles, empty sella) + MRV (r/o CVST) → LP (↑OP, normal CSF)*** [5] | Diagnosis of exclusion after CVST ruled out |
| ***Intracranial hypotension*** | ***Contrast MRI brain*** [5]; ± CSF flow study/MR myelogram | ***Diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement, dilated veins, sagging brain*** |
| **Pituitary adenoma/apoplexy** | ***Contrast MRI (modality of choice)*** [17]; pituitary hormone profile; visual field assessment | MRI: sellar mass ± haemorrhage; hormone panel: hyper- or hypo-secretion |
| **Cerebral tumour** | CT brain ± contrast → MRI with contrast [28] | Mass lesion ± oedema ± enhancement ± midline shift |
| **Dissection (carotid/vertebral)** | ***Vascular imaging: Doppler, MR or CT angiogram*** [21] | CTA: intimal flap, tapered occlusion; MRI T1 fat-sat: crescent intramural haematoma |
| **Sinusitis** | ***Imaging of nasal sinuses*** (CT sinuses) [21] | Mucosal thickening, air-fluid levels, opacification of sinuses |

<Callout title="High Yield — Investigation Priorities for Headache">

1. **Most headaches need NO investigations** — primary headaches (TTH, migraine, cluster) are clinical diagnoses based on ICHD-3 criteria.
2. ***Key investigations to consider: FBE, ESR/CRP, selective radiography (skull XR, sinus XR, CT scan or MRI scan)*** [9].
3. **Thunderclap headache**: urgent NCCT → LP (if CT -ve, at ≥ 12h) → CTA/DSA.
4. **CT is king in acute setting**: fast, detects blood and fractures. MRI is the problem-solver for subacute/chronic.
5. **Never LP without CT first** if raised ICP suspected — risk of herniation.
6. **GCA**: start steroids → then biopsy. Do not delay treatment for histology.
7. **IIH**: MRI + MRV (to exclude CVST) → LP for opening pressure. Diagnosis of exclusion.
8. **EDH vs SDH on CT**: Biconvex (lentiform), doesn't cross sutures = EDH; Crescent, crosses sutures = SDH.
