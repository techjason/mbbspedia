## Differential Diagnosis of Headache

The differential diagnosis of headache is one of the broadest in medicine. The clinical approach is to **first stratify by tempo** (sudden / acute / subacute / chronic), then systematically consider primary versus secondary causes, and finally use clinical features to narrow the list. The overriding goal is always: **can I safely attribute this headache to a benign primary cause, or must I investigate for something life-threatening?**

### Organising Framework — Murtagh's Diagnostic Strategy

John Murtagh's framework is an excellent bedside structure. It forces you to think beyond the obvious [9].

#### ***Probability Diagnosis*** [9]
| Tempo | Most Likely Cause |
|---|---|
| ***Acute*** | ***Respiratory infection*** |
| ***Chronic*** | ***Tension-type headache, combination headache, migraine, transformed migraine*** |

> Why respiratory infection for acute? Upper respiratory tract infections produce headache via mucosal congestion in the paranasal sinuses → ↑sinus cavity pressure → stimulation of V1/V2 nociceptors in sinus mucosa. This is the headache you get with every common cold.

#### ***Serious Disorders Not to Be Missed*** [9]
| Category | Conditions |
|---|---|
| ***Cardiovascular*** | ***Subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, carotid or vertebral artery dissection, temporal arteritis, cerebral venous thrombosis*** |
| ***Neoplasia*** | ***Cerebral tumour, pituitary tumour*** |
| ***Infection*** | ***Meningitis (esp. fungal), encephalitis, intracranial abscess*** |
| ***Haematoma*** | ***Extradural / subdural*** |
| ***Other*** | ***Glaucoma, benign intracranial hypertension*** |

#### ***Pitfalls (Often Missed)*** [9]
- ***Cervical spondylosis / dysfunction***
- ***Dental disorders***
- ***Refractive errors of eye***
- ***Sinusitis***
- ***Ophthalmic herpes zoster (pre-eruption)*** — pain precedes the rash by days; if you don't think of it, you'll miss it until vesicles appear in V1 territory
- ***Exertional headache***
- ***Hypoglycaemia***
- ***Post-traumatic headache (e.g. post-concussion)***
- ***Post-spinal procedure (e.g. epidural, lumbar puncture)***
- ***Sleep apnoea*** — morning headaches from nocturnal hypercapnia → cerebral vasodilation → ↑ICP
- ***Rarities: Paget disease, post-sexual intercourse, cluster headache, Cushing syndrome, Conn syndrome, Addison disease, dysautonomic cephalgia***

<Callout title="Exertional and Sexual Headache — Don't Forget SAH" type="error">
***Headaches associated with specific activities***: sudden severe headache with exertion, especially sexual activity, lasting < 10–15 minutes. ***The critical differential is subarachnoid haemorrhage (which can also occur during coitus)*** [2]. Always investigate the first episode of thunderclap headache during exertion/sex — you cannot assume it is benign until SAH has been excluded.
</Callout>

#### ***Masquerades Checklist*** [9]
- ***Depression*** — chronic daily headache may be the presenting complaint of underlying depressive illness
- ***Diabetes*** — hypoglycaemia can present as headache; diabetic ketoacidosis causes headache from cerebral oedema
- ***Drugs (see list)*** — alcohol, analgesics (rebound), caffeine, antihypertensives, COCP, corticosteroids, NSAIDs (esp. indomethacin), vasodilators esp. nitrates, sildenafil [9]
- ***Anaemia*** — severe anaemia → compensatory ↑cerebral blood flow → vessel distension → headache
- ***Thyroid disorder and other endocrine (Cushing, Conn, Addison)*** — hypothyroidism a/w headache via ↑CSF pressure; phaeochromocytoma: ***classic triad of paroxysmal headache, sweating, palpitations*** [20]
- ***Spinal dysfunction (cervicogenic)***
- ***UTI*** — systemic infection → febrile headache

#### ***Is the Patient Trying to Tell Me Something?*** [9]
***Quite likely if there is an underlying psychogenic disorder*** [9]. Always consider whether the headache is the patient's "ticket" to discuss stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, or substance abuse.

### Differential Diagnosis by Temporal Profile

This is the most practical way to approach headache in an exam or at the bedside. The table below integrates multiple sources [1][2][3][21].

#### ACUTE Headache (Minutes to Hours)

| D/dx | Distinguishing Features | Why These Features Occur |
|---|---|---|
| ***Sinusitis*** | ***Preceding 'cold', nasal discharge*** [3][21] | Mucosal inflammation + sinus obstruction → ↑pressure in closed sinus cavity → V1/V2 nociceptor activation |
| ***Migraine*** | ***Visual/neurological aura, nausea, vomiting*** [3][21]; unilateral, throbbing, 4–72h, debilitating | Cortical spreading depression → trigeminovascular activation → CGRP release → neurogenic inflammation |
| ***Cluster headache*** | ***Lacrimation, rhinorrhoea*** [3][21]; severe periorbital, 15–180min, same time daily, agitation | Hypothalamic activation → trigeminal-autonomic reflex |
| ***Glaucoma*** | ***'Misting' of vision, 'haloes' around objects*** [3][21]; severe eye pain, red eye, fixed mid-dilated pupil, rock-hard globe | Acute ↑intraocular pressure → corneal oedema (haloes) + direct stimulation of ciliary/trigeminal nociceptors |
| ***Arterial dissection (carotid)*** | ***Unilateral pain, Horner's syndrome*** [3][21]; ipsilateral neck pain, may have TIA/stroke | Intimal tear → intramural haematoma stretches vessel wall nociceptors; haematoma compresses pericarotid sympathetic → Horner's |
| ***Arterial dissection (vertebral)*** | ***Symptoms of cerebral ischaemia*** [3][21]; occipital/posterior neck pain | Vertebral artery supplies posterior circulation → dissection → posterior stroke risk |
| ***Retrobulbar neuritis*** | ***Loss of vision (unilateral)*** [3][21]; pain on eye movement | Inflammation of posterior optic nerve → pain from traction on inflamed nerve sheath by extraocular muscles [22] |
| ***Post-traumatic*** | ***Following head injury*** [3][21] | Direct trauma to pain-sensitive structures ± evolving intracranial haematoma |
| ***Drugs/toxins*** | ***On vasodilator drugs*** [3][21] | Vasodilation → ↑pulsatile stretch of intracranial arterial nociceptors |
| ***Haemorrhage (SAH, ICH)*** | ***Instantaneous onset, vomiting, neck stiffness, impaired conscious level*** [3][21] | SAH: blood in subarachnoid space → meningeal irritation; ICH: rapid mass effect → traction on dura/vessels |
| ***Infection (meningitis, encephalitis)*** | ***As above but more gradual onset with pyrexia*** [3][21] | Infectious exudate in subarachnoid space → meningeal nociceptor stimulation + systemic inflammatory response → fever |
| ***Hydrocephalus*** | ***Impaired conscious levels, leg weakness, impaired upward gaze*** [3][21] | Acute CSF outflow obstruction → rapid ↑ICP → traction on dura; upward gaze palsy from pressure on tectal plate (Parinaud's) |
| **Pituitary apoplexy** | Sudden excruciating headache, diplopia (CN III), hypopituitarism (esp. adrenal crisis) [17] | Acute haemorrhage into pituitary → rapid stretching of diaphragma sellae (dural fold) → headache; lateral extension compresses CN III in cavernous sinus |
| ***Hypertensive crisis*** | ***Severe headache, vomiting, visual disturbances, transient paralyses, convulsions*** [8] | Acute ↑↑BP → failure of cerebral autoregulation → cerebral oedema → ↑ICP |
| **Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis** | ↑ICP (headache, papilloedema, ↓GCS), seizure, focal neurological deficit [13] | Venous outflow obstruction → ↑venous pressure → ↑ICP + venous infarction |

#### SUBACUTE Headache (Days to Weeks)

| D/dx | Distinguishing Features | Why These Features Occur |
|---|---|---|
| ***Infection (subacute/chronic meningitis, e.g. TB; cerebral abscess)*** | ***Impaired conscious level, pyrexia, neck stiffness, focal neurological signs*** [3][21] | Chronic granulomatous basal meningitis (TB) → basal cistern exudate → CN palsies (esp. II, VI), hydrocephalus [23]; abscess → focal mass effect + surrounding oedema |
| ***Intracranial tumour*** | ***Vomiting, papilloedema, impaired conscious level + focal neurological signs*** [3][21] | Growing mass → ↑ICP → traction on dura/vessels → headache; focal signs reflect location of tumour |
| ***Chronic subdural haematoma*** | ***As above (vomiting, papilloedema, ↓conscious level, focal signs)*** [3][21] | Slow venous bleeding from torn bridging veins → gradually expanding collection → progressive mass effect over weeks [11] |
| ***Hydrocephalus*** | ***Impaired conscious levels, leg weakness, impaired upward gaze*** [3][21] | Progressive CSF accumulation → ventriculomegaly → compression of periventricular white matter |
| ***Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)*** | ***Papilloedema, visual obscurations, CN6 palsy*** [3][5][21] | ↑ICP without mass lesion; obese young woman; mechanism: ↓CSF reabsorption + ↑CSF outflow resistance |
| ***Temporal arteritis (GCA)*** | ***Thickened, tender scalp arteries*** [3][10][21]; new headache > 50yo, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, ↑↑ESR | Granulomatous arteritis of superficial temporal artery → vessel wall inflammation → nociceptor stimulation; luminal narrowing → ischaemia (jaw claudication, AAION) |
| ***Intracranial hypotension*** | ***Worse on standing*** [3][5][21]; orthostatic headache that promptly resolves when supine | CSF leak → ↓CSF volume → brain sags → traction on dura, bridging veins, CN [5] |

#### CHRONIC/RECURRENT Headache (Weeks to Months)

| D/dx | Distinguishing Features | Why These Features Occur |
|---|---|---|
| ***Tension-type headache*** | ***Anxiety, depression*** [3][21]; bilateral band-like, no associated symptoms, can carry on with activities | Chronic muscular tension + central sensitization in pericranial muscles |
| ***Transformed migraine*** | ***Previous history of episodic migraine*** [3][21]; gradual ↑frequency over months–years | Repeated trigeminovascular activation → central sensitization → chronification; often MOH contributes |
| ***Medication overuse headache (MOH)*** | ***Regular analgesic > 15 days a month*** [3][21]; headache worsens despite ↑medication | Chronic analgesic use → downregulation of endogenous pain-inhibitory pathways → rebound headache when drug wears off |
| ***Ocular 'eye strain'*** | ***Impaired visual acuity*** [3][21] | Uncorrected refractive error → sustained contraction of ciliary and extraocular muscles → frontal headache |
| ***Cervical spondylosis (referred)*** | Commonly over occipital region; neck stiffness/pain [2] | Degenerative cervical spine disease → nociceptor activation of C1–C3 nerve roots → referred pain to occiput (trigeminocervical convergence) |

### Differentiating Primary Headache Syndromes

This is a high-yield comparison that comes up repeatedly in exams [2][3].

| Feature | **Migraine** | **Tension-type** | **Cluster** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Onset*** | ***Gradual onset, crescendo*** | ***Gradual onset, wax-and-wane*** | ***Rapid onset*** |
| ***Triggers*** | ***Premenstrual, stress, exercise*** | ***Emotions, stress*** | ***Alcohol, GTN; periodicity and clustering*** |
| ***Quality*** | ***Unilateral pulsating, moderate-severe, debilitating (↑by movement)*** | ***Bilateral band-like tightness*** | ***Severe unilateral periorbital deep, piercing pain; restlessness*** |
| ***Duration*** | ***4–72h*** | ***30min–7d*** | ***15min–3h*** |
| ***Associated*** | ***Nausea/vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia; preceded by aura*** | ***None*** | ***Ipsilateral autonomic features (lacrimation, nasal congestion, conjunctival injection, Horner's)*** |
| **Behaviour during attack** | Lies still in dark, quiet room | Can carry on with activities | Paces, rocks, restless — cannot keep still |

> **Mnemonic for migraine = POUND**: ***P***ounding, lasting 4–72 h***O***urs, ***U***nilateral, ***N***ausea/vomiting, ***D***ebilitating [2].

### Differential Diagnosis by Red Flag Features

This is the approach to use when something doesn't feel right [2][3].

| ***Red Flag*** | ***Differential to Consider*** | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ***Systemic upset (constitutional symptoms, fever, cancer, immunodeficiency)*** | ***CNS infections, neoplastic (lymphoma/metastasis), vasculitis*** [3] | Systemic inflammation or immunosuppression → ↑risk of opportunistic CNS infection, haematogenous spread of tumour, or systemic vasculitis |
| ***Neurological symptoms (confusion, focal symptoms, LOC, seizures, meningism)*** | ***Intracranial pathologies (vascular, neoplastic, infection)*** [3] | Focal neurological deficit implies structural lesion disrupting specific neural pathways |
| ***Onset is new and sudden*** | ***Temporal arteritis if new onset > 60yo*** [3]; ***Sudden onset: Primary — crash migraine, cluster, benign exertional/orgasmic; Secondary vascular — unruptured saccular aneurysm, SAH, ICA dissection, CVST, hypertensive crises; Secondary non-vascular — intermittent hydrocephalus, benign intracranial HTN, pituitary apoplexy, infections, acute mountain sickness, acute optic neuritis, acute glaucoma*** [3] | Sudden onset implies a "vascular" mechanism (rupture, occlusion, dissection) until proven otherwise |
| ***Other associating symptoms*** | ***Trauma → intracranial haematoma; Worse when supine + vomiting + ↑with exertion/cough → ↑ICP; Meningococcemic rash → DIC from systemic N. meningitidis; Visual symptoms → glaucoma*** [3] | Each associated symptom narrows the differential by pointing to a specific pain-generating mechanism |
| ***Progression or persistence despite treatment*** | **Evolving secondary cause or MOH** | Primary headaches should respond to appropriate treatment; failure suggests misdiagnosis or medication overuse |

### Special Differential Considerations

#### Thunderclap Headache — The "Can't Miss" Differential

A thunderclap headache (peak intensity within 60 seconds) has a broad secondary differential [2][3]:

| Cause | Key Differentiating Feature |
|---|---|
| **SAH** (most dangerous) | Meningism, LOC, blood on CT or xanthochromia on LP |
| **ICH** | Focal neurological deficit, hypertension |
| **CVST** | Seizures, papilloedema, young woman on OCP/pregnant |
| **Arterial dissection** | Neck/face pain, Horner's, TIA symptoms |
| **Pituitary apoplexy** | Sudden headache + diplopia (CN III) + hypopituitarism [17] |
| **Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS)** | Recurrent thunderclap headaches over days, triggered by exertion/Valsalva/sex, segmental vasoconstriction on angiography |
| **Hypertensive crisis** | BP > 180/120 + target organ damage [8] |
| **Primary thunderclap headache** | Diagnosis of exclusion after all secondary causes ruled out |

<Callout title="SAH Rule" type="error">
Every thunderclap headache is SAH until proven otherwise. A normal CT brain within 6 hours has > 98% sensitivity for SAH, but after 6 hours sensitivity drops rapidly — you MUST do an LP if CT is negative and clinical suspicion remains. Look for xanthochromia (yellow CSF from bilirubin, present 12h–12d after bleed) [13].
</Callout>

#### Headache in the Elderly — Think Secondary

***A patient > 55 years presenting with unaccustomed headache probably has an organic cause*** [9]. The differential shifts:
- **GCA** (must exclude — visual loss is preventable with steroids)
- **Chronic SDH** (elderly with atrophy; may have trivial/forgotten trauma)
- **Cerebral tumour** (primary or metastatic)
- **Cervical spondylosis**
- **Medication-related** (polypharmacy common)

#### Headache with Endocrine "Masquerades"

Several endocrine conditions present with headache as a prominent symptom [9][17][20]:

| Condition | Mechanism of Headache |
|---|---|
| **Phaeochromocytoma** | Paroxysmal catecholamine surges → acute ↑BP → headache; ***classic triad: paroxysmal headache, sweating, palpitations*** [20] |
| **Pituitary adenoma** | Mass effect stretching diaphragma sellae → headache; + VF defects, CN palsies, hypopituitarism [17] |
| **Acromegaly** | Pituitary adenoma local effects (headache, VF defects) + GH excess → soft tissue/bone overgrowth [17] |
| ***Cushing syndrome*** | Cortisol excess → ↑BP → headache; + IIH association [9] |
| ***Conn syndrome*** | Aldosterone excess → ↑BP → headache [9] |
| ***Addison disease*** | Cortisol deficiency → headache (mechanism unclear; possibly ↑vasopressin/↓cortisol modulation of nociception) [9] |
| **Hypoglycaemia** | ↓glucose → cerebral energy crisis → compensatory cerebral vasodilation → headache [9] |
