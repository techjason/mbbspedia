## Complications of Headache and its Causes

Complications in the headache domain fall into two broad buckets:

1. **Complications of the primary headache disorders themselves** — these are consequences of the headache disease process running unchecked, or of its treatment going wrong.
2. **Complications of the serious secondary causes of headache** — these are the sequelae of SAH, ICH, meningitis, GCA, IIH, etc. Understanding them is essential because preventing and recognising these complications drives much of acute headache management.

## I. Complications of Primary Headache Disorders

### A. Migraine Complications [4]

Migraine is not simply a "benign" headache — chronic or severe migraine can lead to well-defined complications recognised by the ICHD-3.

| Complication | Definition | Pathophysiology | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Chronic migraine*** | ***≥ 15 headache days/month for > 3 months without medication overuse*** [4] | Repeated trigeminovascular activation → progressive central sensitization of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis → ↓pain threshold → headaches become self-perpetuating even without external triggers | Major burden on quality of life; often coexists with MOH; requires prophylactic treatment (CGRP mAb, botox, topiramate) |
| ***Status migrainosus*** | ***Debilitating migraine attack lasting > 72 hours*** [4] | Prolonged trigeminovascular activation that fails to self-terminate; often triggered by medication overuse, hormonal changes, or emotional stress | Medical emergency — risk of dehydration from protracted vomiting; may require IV fluids, IV metoclopramide, IV dexamethasone, and parenteral triptans or dihydroergotamine |
| ***Persistent aura without infarction*** | ***Aura symptoms lasting > 1 week*** [4] without evidence of infarction on imaging | Cortical spreading depression fails to resolve → persistent cortical dysfunction; mechanism poorly understood | Must image (MRI with DWI) to exclude infarction; reassurance if imaging normal; may persist for months |
| ***Migrainous infarction*** | ***Aura symptoms lasting > 1 hour + ischaemic infarct confirmed on CT/MRI*** [4] | CSD → prolonged cortical oligaemia → if blood flow drops below the infarction threshold, irreversible ischaemia occurs; there is a ***small but documented ↑risk of stroke during/after a migrainous attack*** [4] | Treat as acute ischaemic stroke; thrombolysis if within window; long-term — risk factor modification, consider discontinuing OCP (oestrogen-containing contraceptives compound the risk) |
| ***Migraine-triggered seizure*** | ***Epileptic seizure occurring during or ≤ 1 hour of aura*** [4] | CSD wave is a massive wave of neuronal depolarization — if it reaches sufficient intensity, it can trigger epileptiform discharges; the cortex is transiently hyperexcitable during CSD | Anticonvulsant therapy if recurrent; distinguished from seizure with post-ictal headache (which is the reverse temporal relationship) |

> **Why are migraineurs at ↑risk of stroke?** Several mechanisms are proposed: (1) CSD can reduce cortical perfusion below the ischaemic threshold; (2) migraine-associated endothelial dysfunction promotes thrombosis; (3) patent foramen ovale (PFO) — more prevalent in migraineurs with aura — allows paradoxical embolism; (4) oestrogen-containing OCP further ↑thrombotic risk. This is why ***migraine with aura + OCP + smoking*** is a dangerous triad for stroke risk.

### B. Medication Overuse Headache (MOH) [15]

MOH is the most common complication of all primary headache treatment. It deserves emphasis because it is largely **iatrogenic and preventable**.

- ***Can complicate any kind of headache syndrome but especially a/w migraine and TTH*** [15]
- ***Characterized by: gradual ↑headache frequency and drug consumption, change in headache characteristics*** [15]
- Mechanism: chronic analgesic use → downregulation of endogenous opioid and serotonin pain-inhibition pathways → ↓pain threshold → rebound headache when drug wears off → patient takes MORE drug → vicious cycle
- ***Ergotamine*** has ***high risk of overuse syndrome and rebound headache*** [15]
- Prevention: limit acute medication to < 2 days/week; start prophylaxis early if attacks are frequent

### C. TTH Chronification

- Episodic TTH can evolve into chronic TTH (≥ 15 days/month for > 3 months) if not managed
- Central sensitization becomes established → headache becomes self-sustaining
- Often overlaps with MOH and depression — creating a "triple comorbidity" that is difficult to treat

### D. Cluster Headache Complications

- **Suicide risk**: cluster headache is sometimes called "suicide headache" because of the unbearable severity; patients during cluster periods are at genuinely elevated risk of self-harm
- **Chronic cluster headache**: ~10–15% of patients develop chronic cluster (attacks recur > 1 year without remission > 1 month) — much harder to treat; may require lithium or occipital nerve stimulation
- **Horner's syndrome** may become permanent after repeated cluster periods due to cumulative sympathetic damage in the pericarotid plexus

## II. Complications of Secondary Causes of Headache

### A. Subarachnoid Haemorrhage (SAH) Complications

SAH has the highest complication burden of any headache-associated emergency. The **50% mortality at 1 month** [6] reflects the severity of these complications.

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Re-bleeding** | Highest in first 24h (3–4%), then 1–2% per day in first month [31] | Unsecured aneurysm with thin-walled fundus at rupture point → systemic BP fluctuations → re-rupture; ***aneurysmal rupture is associated with a mortality of 70%*** [31] | ***Aneurysm repair (clip or coil) within 24–72 hours*** [31]; bed rest, stool softeners, BP control before securing |
| **Cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI)** | Days 4–14 (peak day 7) | Blood breakdown products (oxyhaemoglobin, bilirubin oxidation products) in the subarachnoid space → direct smooth muscle contraction + endothelial dysfunction + inflammation → segmental arterial narrowing → ↓cerebral perfusion | Nimodipine 60mg q4h PO × 21 days (prevents DCI, not vasospasm per se); euvolaemia; induced hypertension if DCI occurs; IA vasodilators or balloon angioplasty for refractory vasospasm |
| **Hydrocephalus** | Acute (hours–days) or chronic (weeks–months) | **Acute**: blood clot in 4th ventricle or cerebral aqueduct → **obstructive hydrocephalus**; **Chronic**: blood products impair CSF reabsorption at arachnoid granulations → **communicating hydrocephalus** [31][32] | Acute: ***EVD (external ventricular drain)*** [31]; Chronic: VP shunt |
| ***Seizures*** [31][32] | Acute or delayed | Cortical irritation by subarachnoid blood; cortical ischaemia from vasospasm → epileptogenic focus | ***Prophylactic anticonvulsant if SAH*** [32]; early IV phenytoin or levetiracetam if seizure occurs |
| ***Cerebral oedema*** [31] | Hours–days | Global cerebral ischaemia from acute ↑ICP + vasospasm → cytotoxic oedema; BBB disruption → vasogenic oedema | Head elevation 30°, osmotherapy (IV mannitol), avoid hyperthermia, consider decompressive craniectomy if refractory |
| ***Herniation*** [31] | Hours–days | Expanding haematoma or severe oedema → brain displacement through tentorial or foramen magnum openings | Emergency neurosurgery; osmotherapy as temporising measure |
| **Hyponatraemia** | Days 3–14 | Cerebral salt wasting (CSW — inappropriate natriuresis from ANP/BNP release) or SIADH → ↓serum Na | Distinguish CSW (hypovolaemic) from SIADH (euvolaemic): CSW requires saline replacement; SIADH requires fluid restriction. Hyponatraemia can worsen cerebral oedema |
| **Cardiac complications** | Acute | Sympathetic surge from hypothalamic dysfunction → catecholamine storm → myocardial stunning ("neurogenic stunned myocardium"), arrhythmias, troponin rise, ECG changes (deep T-wave inversions, prolonged QT) | Continuous cardiac monitoring; usually self-limiting; distinguish from ACS |

### B. Intracerebral Haemorrhage (ICH) Complications [14][31][32]

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Haematoma expansion** | Ongoing bleeding in the first 6–24h; more likely if on anticoagulants, large initial volume, "spot sign" on CTA (active contrast extravasation) | Drives early neurological deterioration; aggressive BP control (SBP < 140) and anticoagulation reversal reduce expansion |
| **↑ICP and herniation** | Mass effect of haematoma + surrounding oedema → Monro-Kellie exceeded → herniation | ***Head elevation 30°; IV mannitol (osmotic diuretic) is the treatment of choice to lower ICP; corticosteroids should NOT be administered — dexamethasone does NOT improve outcome but increases complication rate, primarily infection*** [31] |
| **Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH)** | Haematoma ruptures into ventricle → obstructive hydrocephalus | ***Burr hole + EVD*** [14]; consider intraventricular tPA to accelerate clot lysis |
| ***Seizures*** | Cortical irritation by blood products; more common in lobar ICH (cortical location) than deep ICH | ***Prophylactic use of anticonvulsants is NOT recommended; treat clinical seizures and electrographic seizures on EEG*** [31][32] |

<Callout title="Steroids in ICH — A Common Exam Trap" type="error">
***Corticosteroids should NOT be administered in patients with elevated ICP in intracerebral haemorrhage. Dexamethasone does NOT improve outcome but increases complication rate, primarily infection*** [31]. This is different from tumour-related oedema where steroids ARE helpful (because tumour oedema is vasogenic and steroid-responsive, while ICH oedema is predominantly cytotoxic).
</Callout>

### C. Epidural and Subdural Haematoma Complications [11][33]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **Uncal herniation → ipsilateral CN III palsy → ipsilateral dilated pupil** | Expanding supratentorial mass → medial temporal lobe (uncus) herniates over tentorial edge → compresses CN III | Parasympathetic fibres on surface of CN III are compressed first → loss of pupillary constriction → fixed, dilated pupil; a neurosurgical emergency |
| **Contralateral OR ipsilateral hemiparesis** | Contralateral: direct cortical compression. Ipsilateral ("false localizing sign"): ***lateral displacement of midbrain compresses contralateral cerebral peduncle against free edge of tentorium*** (Kernohan's notch) [11] | Presence of ipsilateral weakness can be misleading about the side of the lesion — always correlate with imaging |
| ***Cushing's reflex*** | ***Hypertension + bradycardia + respiratory depression/irregularity*** [11] — ↑ICP → brainstem ischaemia → sympathetic surge + baroreceptor reflex + respiratory centre compression | Terminal sign of impending brainstem herniation; demands immediate neurosurgical intervention |
| **Chronic SDH → recurrent haematoma** | After burr-hole drainage, the subdural space has a neovascular membrane → fragile new vessels can re-bleed → recurrence in ~5–30% | Serial imaging post-drainage; some centres leave subdural drains for 24–48h to reduce recurrence |
| ***Overshunting in CSF shunts*** (if shunt placed for secondary hydrocephalus) | ***Postural headache (worsened with standing, relieved lying down); can lead to subdural haematoma (stretching of bridging veins)*** [33] | Paradoxically, treating one complication (hydrocephalus) can create another (SDH from over-drainage) |

### D. Meningitis Complications [34][35]

***Mainly occurs in pyogenic and chronic meningitis*** [34]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hydrocephalus → ↑ICP*** [34][35] | ***Basal meningeal adhesions due to incomplete organization of inflammatory exudates*** → block CSF reabsorption (communicating) or obstruct foramina (obstructive) | ***Hydrocephalus in 80% of TB meningitis*** [35]; requires EVD or VP shunt; a major cause of morbidity |
| ***CN palsies*** (III, IV, VI most common; VIII involvement tends to persist) [34] | Basal meningeal inflammation and scarring → CN entrapment at the skull base | CN VIII involvement → sensorineural hearing loss (may be permanent); CN VI → diplopia |
| **Arteritis / thrombophlebitis → cerebral infarction** [34][35] | Inflammatory exudate surrounds basal arteries → vasculitis → thrombosis → infarction; ***stroke observed in 26% of TBM*** [35] | Can cause devastating focal neurological deficit; often presents as unexpected deterioration during treatment |
| **Parenchymal damage** | Direct neuronal injury from infection + inflammatory mediators + ischaemia | ***Neurological sequelae: intellectual impairment, mental retardation or cerebral palsy*** (especially in paediatric pyogenic meningitis) [34] |
| ***Seizures*** | ***Occur in 10% of acute bacterial meningitis; ~5% develop epilepsy*** [34] | Cortical irritation from inflammation and ischaemia |
| **Spread of infection** | ***Locally → cerebritis, cerebral abscess, subdural effusion/empyema; systemically → arthritis, infective endocarditis*** [34] | Abscess is a surgical emergency if mass effect significant |
| ***SIADH → hyponatraemia*** [34][35] | Meningeal inflammation stimulates ADH release → water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia; also cerebral salt wasting (CSWS) in TBM [35] | Hyponatraemia worsens cerebral oedema; must distinguish SIADH (fluid restrict) from CSWS (salt replace) |
| ***Visual loss*** (TBM) | ***Optochiasmic arachnoiditis (encasement of optic nerve and chiasma by thick TB exudates), dilated 3rd ventricle compressing optic chiasma, ↑ICP, endarteritis of optic nerve and chiasmal vessels*** [35] | Affects ~25% of TBM patients; often irreversible |
| **Sensorineural hearing loss** | Labyrinthitis (spread of infection through cochlear aqueduct) or CN VIII vasculitis | Permanent hearing loss is a major sequela of bacterial meningitis, particularly pneumococcal and meningococcal |

### E. Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) Complications [10]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Permanent visual loss (15–20%)*** [10] | ***AAION: posterior ciliary artery occlusion → optic nerve head infarction*** | Once established, visual loss is irreversible; the fellow eye is at risk (up to 50% within days if untreated) — this is why steroids must be started immediately |
| **Stroke** | Basilar artery or vertebral artery thrombosis from granulomatous inflammation → posterior circulation infarct | Less common than visual loss but devastating |
| ***Aortic aneurysm / dissection*** [10] | ***Large vessel involvement*** — granulomatous inflammation weakens aortic wall → aneurysmal dilation or intimal disruption | Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk ↑17× in GCA; requires long-term surveillance imaging |
| ***Large artery stenosis / occlusion / ectasia*** [10] | Transmural inflammation → intimal hyperplasia → luminal narrowing in subclavian, axillary, carotid arteries | Presents as claudication of upper limbs, discrepant BP, absent pulses |
| **Steroid-related complications** (iatrogenic) | Long-term high-dose prednisolone → osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, infections, adrenal suppression, Cushingoid features, peptic ulcer | Steroid-sparing agents (tocilizumab) are used specifically to minimise this burden; bone protection (bisphosphonates + calcium/vitamin D) started with steroid initiation |

### F. IIH Complications [5][16]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***Severe permanent vision loss*** (***25% at risk***) [5] | ***Chronic papilloedema → progressive optic nerve damage*** — sustained ↑ICP → chronic ischaemia and axonal loss at the optic nerve head [16] | ***Visual prognosis: chronic papilloedema can cause permanent optic nerve damage!*** [16]; visual fields must be monitored regularly |
| **VF constriction** | Progressive loss of peripheral vision from chronic papilloedema → concentric VF loss | Often insidious — the patient may not notice until severe; formal perimetry (Humphrey VF) at every follow-up |
| **CN6 palsy** | False localizing sign from ↑ICP → CN6 stretched over petrous temporal bone | Horizontal diplopia; reversible with ICP reduction |
| **Headache chronification** | Persistent ↑ICP → chronic daily headache refractory to simple analgesics | May develop MOH as patients escalate medication; must address the underlying ICP |

### G. Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST) Complications [13][36]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **Venous haemorrhagic infarction** | Venous outflow obstruction → ↑venous pressure → capillary rupture → haemorrhagic transformation of venous infarct | Unlike arterial infarcts, venous infarcts often have a haemorrhagic component from the outset; ***seizures much more common in venous infarcts (up to 40%) than in arterial infarcts*** [36] |
| ***Seizures*** (up to 40%) [13][36] | Cortical irritation from venous congestion, oedema, and haemorrhage | Levetiracetam preferred (fewer drug interactions than phenytoin); prophylactic AEDs controversial |
| **↑ICP** | Impaired CSF drainage (venous sinuses are the site of CSF reabsorption at arachnoid granulations) | Papilloedema, headache, visual loss; managed with acetazolamide ± serial LP |
| **Chronic dural sinus stenosis** | Residual thrombus → fibrosis → permanent narrowing of venous sinuses | Can lead to persistent ↑ICP mimicking IIH; may require venous sinus stenting |

### H. Brain Tumour Complications [37]

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| ***↑ICP → oedema, herniation*** | Mass effect + vasogenic oedema (BBB disruption by tumour) → Monro-Kellie exceeded | Dexamethasone IS effective here (unlike ICH) — it ↓vasogenic oedema by stabilising BBB; surgical decompression if refractory |
| ***Epilepsy*** | ***Affects 50–80% primary tumours and 10–20% secondary tumours*** [37]; always supratentorial | Focal seizures (simple, complex, with secondary generalisation); anticonvulsants necessary; levetiracetam preferred (fewer interactions with chemotherapy) |
| **Focal neurological deficit** | Neuronal destruction + pressure effect + oedema | Location-specific; may improve with steroids (oedema component) |
| **Pituitary apoplexy** (in pituitary adenoma) | Sudden haemorrhage into the adenoma → rapid expansion within the confined sella turcica [17] | Sudden excruciating headache + diplopia (CN III) + hypopituitarism (especially adrenal crisis → life-threatening if cortisol not replaced); needs steroid cover + urgent surgical decompression |
| **Cranial irradiation complications** [37] | Acute: reactive swelling → ***worsening of prior neurological symptoms*** (pre-treat with steroids); Chronic: ***radionecrosis (1–3 years post-RT)***, neurocognitive deficits, vasculopathy, hypopituitarism (up to 80%), secondary brain tumours | Radionecrosis mimics tumour recurrence on MRI → distinguish by lack of clearly defined T2W lesion and high oedema-to-enhancement ratio; treated symptomatically with steroids |

### I. Stroke-Related Complications (Ischaemic and Haemorrhagic) [31][32]

These are relevant because stroke is a major secondary cause of headache.

#### CNS Complications [31][32]
- ***Seizures*** — cortical irritation by ischaemia or blood; ***prophylactic use of anticonvulsants is NOT recommended*** for ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke [31][32]; treat only if clinical seizures occur
- ***Cerebral oedema → ↑ICP → herniation*** — peaks days 2–5 post-stroke; managed by head elevation, osmotherapy, decompressive craniectomy for malignant MCA syndrome or massive cerebellar infarct [14]
- **Haemorrhagic transformation** of ischaemic infarct — particularly after thrombolysis (***5–7% symptomatic ICH*** with IV alteplase [31]); managed by stopping tPA + cryoprecipitate + antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid)

#### Systemic Complications [31][32]
| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention/Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Aspiration pneumonia*** | Dysphagia from brainstem/cortical stroke → aspiration of oral secretions/food | Speech therapist assessment before oral feeding; NGT if unsafe swallow |
| ***DVT / PE*** | Immobilization → venous stasis (Virchow's triad) | ***SC unfractionated/LMW heparin in immobilized patients (ischaemic); intermittent pneumatic compression starting day of admission (haemorrhagic)*** [31][32]; aspirin if anticoagulants contraindicated |
| ***UTI*** | Indwelling catheter → ascending infection; neurogenic bladder from cortical/brainstem lesions | Intermittent catheterisation preferred; avoid prolonged indwelling catheter; measure post-void residual [32] |
| ***Pressure sores*** | Immobility → sustained pressure on skin → tissue necrosis | Frequent turning, pressure-relieving mattresses, nutritional optimisation [32] |
| ***Post-stroke depression*** | ***Prevalence 29%*** [31]; multifactorial — neurochemical changes (disrupted monoamine pathways), psychological reaction to disability, social isolation | ***Structured depression screening recommended; treat with antidepressants in absence of contraindications*** [31]; SSRIs preferred (fewer anticholinergic side effects than TCAs) |
| **Dehydration / malnutrition** | ↓oral intake from dysphagia + ↓consciousness | Early NGT or PEG feeding if prolonged dysphagia expected |
| **Contractures / frozen shoulder** | Prolonged immobility → joint capsule shortening | Early physiotherapy and occupational therapy [32]; positioning of weak limbs |

### J. CSF Shunt Complications [33]

Relevant because hydrocephalus is a complication of many headache-causing conditions (SAH, meningitis, tumour, IIH).

| Complication | Details | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Shunt blockage (most common)*** | ***80% proximal block, 10% valve, 10% distal block; causes: choroid plexus, brain parenchyma, protein, tumour cells*** [33] | Tissue debris obstructs the narrow lumen of the ventricular catheter |
| ***Shunt infection (most serious)*** | ***Pathogens: S. epidermidis, S. aureus; S/S: fever, lethargy, meningism, signs of raised ICP*** [33] | Biofilm formation on shunt catheter by skin commensals introduced at surgery |
| ***Overshunting*** | ***Postural headache (worsened with standing/sitting, relieved lying down); can lead to subdural haematoma (stretching of bridging veins)*** [33] | Excessive CSF drainage → intracranial hypotension → brain sags → bridging veins tear → SDH |
| **Distal catheter complications** | ***Inguinal hernia, perforated abdominal viscus/peritonitis, intraperitoneal CSF-filled pseudocyst, tumour seeding*** [33] | Peritoneal end of VP shunt can irritate or perforate bowel; CSF collection can form loculated pseudocysts |
