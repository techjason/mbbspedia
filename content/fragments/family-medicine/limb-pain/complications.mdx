## Complications of Limb Pain and Its Underlying Causes

Complications in the context of limb pain arise from two broad categories: **(1) complications of the underlying disease itself** (e.g. tissue death from ischaemia, joint destruction from infection) and **(2) complications of the treatment** (e.g. reperfusion injury after revascularisation, bleeding from anticoagulation). Understanding the pathophysiology from first principles is the key to predicting, recognising, and managing these complications.

---

### A. Complications of Acute Limb Ischaemia

These are the most critical and examinable complications. They fall into two groups: complications from the ischaemia itself and complications from reperfusion after revascularisation.

#### 1. Compartment Syndrome

***Compartment syndrome*** [1][2][11]:

- ***Mechanism: prolonged ischaemia (≥ 6h) + delayed revascularisation → fluid leaks out via damaged cell membrane → oedema → secondary ischaemia when pressure ≥ 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP*** [1]

The pathophysiology in detail [2]:
- Muscle deprived of arterial blood flow becomes ischaemic → cell membrane integrity breaks down → intracellular contents leak into the interstitium
- Upon reperfusion, oxygen-free radicals are generated → these directly damage capillary walls → increased vascular permeability → further fluid leak into the closed fascial compartment
- The fascial compartment is non-distensible (fascia does not stretch) → rising intracompartmental pressure → compression of capillaries → secondary ischaemia (a vicious cycle)
- When intracompartmental pressure exceeds capillary perfusion pressure, nutrient flow to muscle and nerve ceases completely despite axial blood flow having been restored

***Clinical features*** [1][11]:
- ***Pain out of proportion to clinical situation (earliest symptom)*** [1]
- ***Pain with passive stretch (most sensitive sign)*** [1] — Why? Stretching the ischaemic muscle increases its metabolic demand, widening the supply-demand mismatch
- ***Numbness in distribution of nerves running within the compartment*** [11]
- ***Tense compartment on passive toe dorsiflexion and plantarflexion*** [11]
- ***Pulses can be present (SBP >> intracompartmental pressure)*** [11] — this is a classic exam trap; do NOT wait for pulselessness

***Site*** [1][2]:
- ***Commonly calf, especially anterior tibial compartment*** [1]
- ***Anterior compartment is most commonly affected whereas involvement of posterior compartment is the most functionally devastating*** [2] — Why? The deep posterior compartment contains the tibial nerve and posterior tibial artery, whose damage leads to loss of plantar sensation and foot blood supply

***Numbness in the web space between first and second toes is suggestive*** [2] — because this is the territory of the deep peroneal nerve, which runs through the anterior compartment

***Management*** [1][11]:
- ***Emergent fasciotomy → lay open for oedema to resolve, then close after a few days*** [1]
- ***Consider prophylactic fasciotomy in OT if drastic ischaemia*** [1]
- ***Check compartment pressure ( < 20 mmHg of diastolic BP) if in doubt*** [1]
- ***Urgent fasciotomy via medial + lateral incisions*** [11]
- Remove constrictive dressings, limb elevation at heart level
- Post-op: wound left open, re-inspect at 48h, ± remove necrotic tissue [13]

<Callout title="Volkmann's Contracture" type="error">
***Volkmann's contracture*** is the dreaded late complication of untreated compartment syndrome, ***commonly found in supracondylar fractures*** of the elbow in children [13]. The sequence is: compartment syndrome → prolonged ischaemia → muscle necrosis → fibrosis → fixed flexion contracture of the forearm and hand. The classic posture is wrist flexion + MCP hyperextension + IP flexion + thumb adduction. This is an irreversible deformity — prevention by early fasciotomy is the only effective strategy.
</Callout>

#### 2. Rhabdomyolysis

***Rhabdomyolysis*** [1][2][11]:

- ***Mechanism: reperfusion → release of K+, lactic acid, myoglobin, CK from damaged muscle*** [1]

From first principles: skeletal muscle cells contain huge amounts of potassium (intracellular K+ ≈ 150 mEq/L), myoglobin (for oxygen storage), creatine kinase (for ATP regeneration), and lactic acid (from anaerobic metabolism during ischaemia). When these cells die and their membranes lose integrity, all these contents spill into the systemic circulation simultaneously.

***Consequences*** [1][2]:
- ***Acute renal failure*** — myoglobin is freely filtered by the glomerulus but precipitates in the renal tubules (especially in acidic urine, forming myoglobin casts) → acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Additionally, free myoglobin generates reactive oxygen species in tubular cells → direct tubular toxicity.
- ***Cardiac arrhythmia*** — hyperkalaemia depolarises the resting membrane potential of cardiomyocytes → widened QRS, peaked T waves → eventually VF/asystole
- ***ARDS*** — systemic inflammatory response from massive muscle necrosis → capillary leak in lungs
- ***Metabolic acidosis*** — release of lactic acid + failure of renal acid excretion

***Risk factors*** [1]: ***poor background renal function***

***Management*** [1][2][11]:
- ***Aggressive hydration ± IV bicarbonate (decreases acidosis, decreases myoglobin cast formation) ± dialysis*** [1]
- ***Diuresis with mannitol*** [11] — osmotic diuretic to maintain tubular flow and prevent cast formation
- ***Post-op: monitor BP/P, UO, APTT, RFT, cardiac monitor*** [11]
- Correct hyperkalaemia: IV calcium gluconate (membrane stabiliser), insulin + dextrose (intracellular K+ shift), sodium bicarbonate, calcium resonium, dialysis if refractory

<Callout title="Why IV Bicarbonate for Rhabdomyolysis?">
Myoglobin precipitates in acidic urine to form obstructive casts. By alkalinising the urine (target urine pH > 6.5), you keep myoglobin in a soluble form and reduce its nephrotoxicity. Bicarbonate also directly counteracts the systemic metabolic acidosis from lactic acid release. This is why bicarbonate is given alongside aggressive IV fluid resuscitation.
</Callout>

#### 3. Reperfusion Injury [2]

***Reperfusion injury*** [2]:
- ***Results from formation of oxygen-free radicals that directly damage the tissue and cause WBC accumulation and sequestration in microcirculation***
- ***Prolongs ischaemic interval since it impairs adequate nutrient flow to the tissue despite restoration of axial blood flow***

The mechanism: during ischaemia, xanthine dehydrogenase is converted to xanthine oxidase. Upon reperfusion, xanthine oxidase reacts with O2 to generate superoxide radicals (O2⁻). These radicals:
1. Directly damage endothelial cells → increased capillary permeability → oedema
2. Attract and activate neutrophils → further tissue damage via proteolytic enzymes
3. Cause platelet activation → microvascular thrombosis → "no-reflow phenomenon"

This is why ***more gradual clot dissolution with thrombolysis decreases incidence of reperfusion syndrome compared to open surgical procedures where rapid return of blood flow may precipitate compartment syndrome*** [2].

#### 4. Stroke and Haemorrhage (Post-Thrombolysis) [2][11]

***Patients treated with endovascular procedures (thrombolysis) are associated with a higher risk of stroke and major haemorrhage including GI bleeding and haematoma at vascular puncture site*** [2]

- tPA is a systemic fibrinolytic — it activates plasminogen to plasmin, which dissolves fibrin clots everywhere in the body, not just at the target site
- This creates a systemic "lytic state" where any fragile vessel or recent wound site can bleed
- Haemorrhagic stroke is the most feared complication (mortality ~50%)

---

### B. Complications of Chronic Limb Ischaemia

#### 1. Progression to Critical Limb Ischaemia

***Prognosis for chronic limb ischaemia*** [1]:
- ***Non-critical CLI: at 5 years*** →
  - ***Limb: stable claudication (70–80%), worsening claudication (10–20%), critical CLI (1–2%)***
  - ***CVS: non-fatal MI/stroke (20%), death (15–30%)***
- ***Critical CLI: at 1 year*** →
  - ***Outcome: alive with two limbs (50%), amputation (25%), CVS mortality (25%)***

The key message: **PAD patients are far more likely to die of MI or stroke than to lose their limb**. This is why cardiovascular risk factor modification (smoking cessation, statins, aspirin, BP and DM control) is the cornerstone of management — it addresses the systemic atherosclerotic burden, not just the leg.

#### 2. Tissue Loss — Ulceration and Gangrene

Progressive ischaemia → tissue death → ulceration at pressure points (toes, heel, lateral malleolus) or gangrene.

| Type | ***Dry Gangrene*** [2] | ***Wet Gangrene*** [2] |
|---|---|---|
| ***Texture*** | ***Hard, dry, shrunken*** | ***Soft, moist, swollen*** |
| ***Infection*** | ***Non-infected*** | ***Infected*** |
| ***Demarcation*** | ***Clear line between viable and necrotic tissue*** | ***No clear line*** |
| ***Management*** | ***Safe to allow self-amputation after demarcation with precautions against infection*** | ***Emergency: surgical debridement or amputation*** |

Why does wet gangrene require emergency treatment? Because the liquefactive necrosis provides an excellent medium for bacterial growth → sepsis → multiorgan failure → death. Dry gangrene, by contrast, is coagulative necrosis — the dead tissue desiccates and essentially mummifies, creating a barrier against infection.

#### 3. Cardiovascular Events

PAD is a marker of systemic atherosclerosis. Patients with PAD have a 2–3× increased risk of MI and stroke compared to the general population. This is why every PAD patient should be on:
- Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or clopidogrel)
- Statin (regardless of lipid level)
- Aggressive management of hypertension and diabetes

#### 4. Endovascular and Surgical Complications

***Specific complications of endovascular treatment*** [11]:
- ***Arterial dissection / rupture*** — the guidewire or balloon can tear the intima
- ***Distal embolisation*** — plaque fragments dislodge and travel downstream
- ***Re-stenosis*** — neointimal hyperplasia (smooth muscle proliferation at the treatment site)

***Complications of bypass surgery***: graft thrombosis, graft infection, wound infection, pseudoaneurysm at anastomosis

---

### C. Complications of Amputation

***Early complications*** [11]:
- ***Wound: haematoma, infection, abscess, dehiscence, gangrene (Mx: higher amputation)***
- ***Surrounding skin: skin necrosis (poor perfusion to stump)***
- ***Nerve: phantom limb pain (Mx: reassurance, amitriptyline, gabapentin)***
- ***Vein: DVT/PE (Mx: prophylactic heparin)***

***Late complications*** [11]:
- ***Joint: fixed flexion deformity***
- ***Bone: osteomyelitis, osteophyte formation***
- ***Surrounding skin: stump ulceration (pressure from prosthesis)***
- ***Nerve: stump neuroma***

**Phantom limb pain** deserves special mention. The mechanism is not fully understood but involves:
1. **Peripheral**: neuromas at the cut nerve endings generate spontaneous ectopic discharges
2. **Spinal**: central sensitisation — loss of normal afferent input leads to hyperexcitability of dorsal horn neurons
3. **Cortical**: reorganisation of the somatosensory cortex — the cortical area that previously represented the amputated limb gets "invaded" by adjacent areas, creating aberrant sensory experiences

Management: reassurance (it is real, not imaginary), gabapentin/pregabalin, amitriptyline, mirror therapy, TENS

***Rehab: usually can bear weight on contralateral limb by 1 week, and fit temporary prosthesis by 3 weeks*** [11]

---

### D. Complications of DVT / Venous Thromboembolism

#### 1. Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
- The most feared acute complication of DVT
- Thrombus dislodges from deep leg veins → travels through IVC → right heart → pulmonary arteries → obstruction → V/Q mismatch → hypoxaemia; in massive PE → right heart failure → cardiogenic shock → death
- Risk: approximately 50% of untreated proximal DVT will embolise

#### 2. Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS)
- Occurs in 20–50% of patients after DVT
- Mechanism: DVT causes valvular destruction in the deep veins + residual obstruction → chronic venous hypertension → oedema, skin changes, venous ulceration
- This is essentially secondary chronic venous insufficiency
- Prevention: adequate anticoagulation, early mobilisation

#### 3. Anticoagulation-Related Bleeding
- Major haemorrhage risk: 1–3% per year on warfarin/DOAC
- Management: withhold anticoagulant, reversal agents (vitamin K for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors), supportive care

---

### E. Complications of Musculoskeletal Causes

#### 1. Septic Arthritis [12]
- **Joint destruction**: bacterial proteolytic enzymes destroy articular cartilage within days if untreated
- **Osteomyelitis**: spread of infection from joint to adjacent bone
- **Sepsis / septic shock**: haematogenous dissemination
- **Chronic stiffness / ankylosis**: from cartilage destruction and fibrosis

#### 2. Gout — Chronic Tophaceous Disease [5]

***Complications of gouty tophi*** [5]:
- ***Ulceration with discharging whitish gritty material***
- ***Infection***
- ***Inflammation: erythema and pus discharge without infection → may mimic dactylitis when inflammation extends to entire digit***
- Progressive joint destruction
- ***Renal manifestations: urate stones, uric acid nephropathy*** [5]

#### 3. Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Joint destruction and deformity (swan neck, boutonnière, ulnar deviation, Z-thumb)
- C1/C2 subluxation → cervical myelopathy (potentially fatal)
- Tendon rupture
- Secondary OA
- Systemic: amyloidosis, interstitial lung disease, pericarditis

#### 4. Osteoarthritis
- Progressive joint space narrowing and functional limitation
- Osteophyte formation → nerve compression
- Intra-articular loose bodies → joint locking

---

### F. Complications of Neuropathic Conditions

#### 1. Diabetic Foot Complications [3]
- **Foot ulcers**: 25% lifetime risk, annual risk 2%/year
- **Diabetic foot infections**: cellulitis, osteomyelitis
- **Charcot arthropathy**: multifactorial — lack of proprioception → ligament laxity → joint instability + deformity → prone to damage by minor trauma → vasomotor changes due to autonomic neuropathy lead to exaggerated local inflammatory response → arthropathy

Risk factors for foot ulcer development [3]:
- ***Previous foot ulceration (most important)***
- ***Neuropathy (80%): loss of monofilament sensation, neuropathy disability score***
- ***Foot deformity***
- ***Concomitant vascular disease***

#### 2. Entrapment Neuropathy Complications
- Progressive motor and sensory loss if untreated
- Muscle wasting (thenar wasting in CTS, hypothenar/interosseous wasting in cubital tunnel syndrome)
- Permanent axonal loss if decompression delayed too long

---

### G. Complications of Trauma-Related Limb Pain

***Early complications of fractures/trauma*** [13]:
- ***Local: neurovascular injury, compartment syndrome, wound infection (osteomyelitis)***
- ***Systemic: shock, sepsis, DVT, PE, ARDS (due to fat embolism)***

***Late complications*** [13]:
- ***Local: pressure sores (skin), muscle atrophy, tendon/ligament adhesions, joint instability, nerve paralysis***
- ***Bone: delayed union, malunion, non-union, heterotopic ossification, AVN, chronic osteomyelitis***
- ***CRPS type I (complex regional pain syndrome)***
- ***Volkmann's contracture***
- ***Systemic: crush syndrome***

***Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)*** [15]:

***Always keep regional pain syndrome in mind for persistent burning pain in hand following injury, trivial or severe*** [15]

CRPS ("complex" = multifactorial, "regional" = affecting a limb region, "pain syndrome" = dominant symptom is pain) is characterised by:
- Continuous burning pain disproportionate to the inciting event
- Allodynia (pain from normally non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia
- Skin colour/temperature changes, oedema, sweating abnormalities
- Motor changes: weakness, tremor, dystonia
- Trophic changes: skin atrophy, hair/nail changes

Type I (previously "reflex sympathetic dystrophy"): no demonstrable nerve lesion
Type II (previously "causalgia"): with demonstrable nerve lesion

Management: early physiotherapy, gabapentinoids/TCAs for pain, mirror therapy, psychological support

---

### H. Complications of Immobility from Limb Pain

Any condition causing prolonged limb pain and immobility (stroke, fracture, critical limb ischaemia, post-operative) leads to a cascade of complications [9]:

- ***VTE prophylaxis: elastic stockings (or low dose SC heparin)*** [9]
- ***Pressure sores: reposition weak limbs, frequent turning, use of cushions, egg-crater/air mattress*** [9]
- ***Genitourinary complications: catheter management, avoid bladder overdistension*** [9]
- ***Bowel: high fibre diet + stool softener (NOT laxative) → avoid constipation, fecal impaction*** [9]
- ***Joint contractures***: prevented by early physiotherapy and passive ROM exercises
- ***Muscle atrophy***: disuse atrophy begins within days of immobilisation
- ***Depression***: common and underdiagnosed in patients with chronic limb pain/disability

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Limb Pain">

1. **Compartment syndrome**: mechanism = ischaemia → membrane damage → oedema in non-distensible compartment → secondary ischaemia. Earliest symptom = pain out of proportion. Most sensitive sign = pain with passive stretch. Pulses may be PRESENT. Anterior tibial compartment most common. Tx = emergency fasciotomy.
2. **Rhabdomyolysis**: K+ → arrhythmia; myoglobin → AKI (ATN); lactic acid → metabolic acidosis. Tx = aggressive hydration + IV bicarbonate + mannitol ± dialysis.
3. **Reperfusion injury**: oxygen free radicals → capillary damage → oedema → no-reflow. Thrombolysis has less reperfusion injury than open embolectomy (more gradual reperfusion).
4. **Gangrene**: Dry = non-infected, clear demarcation, can self-amputate. Wet = infected, no demarcation, surgical emergency.
5. **PAD prognosis**: IC patients more likely to die of MI/stroke than lose limb. Critical CLI: 25% dead, 25% amputated at 1 year.
6. **Post-thrombolysis**: stroke and major haemorrhage risk.
7. **Amputation complications**: phantom limb pain (Mx: gabapentin/amitriptyline), stump neuroma, DVT, fixed flexion deformity.
8. **CRPS**: persistent burning pain disproportionate to injury. Think of it for any limb pain not resolving after trivial trauma.
9. **Volkmann's contracture**: late sequela of untreated compartment syndrome, classically in supracondylar fracture.
10. **Diabetic foot**: previous ulceration is the most important RF. Neuropathy causes 80% of ulcers.

      markscheme: "Prolonged ischaemia (6 or more hours) damages cell membranes in skeletal muscle. Upon revascularisation, oxygen free radicals are generated which further damage capillary walls, increasing vascular permeability. Fluid leaks from damaged cells and leaky capillaries into the interstitial space within the non-distensible fascial compartment. Rising intracompartmental pressure exceeds capillary perfusion pressure (at or above 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP), causing secondary ischaemia to muscle and nerves within the compartment — a vicious cycle of oedema and ischaemia."

Can be safely allowed to self-amputate after demarcation, with precautions against infection. Wet gangrene: liquefactive necrosis, infected, soft/moist/swollen, no clear line of demarcation.

This means PAD patients are far more likely to die from MI or stroke than to lose their limb. Therefore management prioritises systemic cardiovascular risk factor modification (smoking cessation, statins, aspirin, DM and BP control, supervised exercise) over surgical intervention for the leg. Surgery is not first-line for intermittent claudication because failed surgery has worse outcomes than no surgery."

      markscheme: "Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Type I (no demonstrable nerve lesion). Pathophysiology is multifactorial: aberrant neuroinflammatory response with peripheral and central sensitisation, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction causing vasomotor and sudomotor changes, and cortical reorganisation. Pain is disproportionate to the inciting event. Management: early physiotherapy and mobilisation (most important), gabapentinoids or TCAs for neuropathic pain, mirror therapy, psychological support, vitamin C (some evidence for prevention). Avoid immobilisation which worsens the condition."
