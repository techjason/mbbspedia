## Complications of Cough

Cough is not just a nuisance. It is a forceful mechanical event that generates enormous intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, and intracranial pressures. When chronic or violent, these pressures cause real, sometimes serious, structural and physiological damage. Additionally, the underlying conditions that cause cough have their own disease-specific complications that must be considered.

This section covers two categories:
1. **Complications of the cough itself** (the mechanical act of coughing causing harm)
2. **Complications of the underlying conditions** that cause cough (disease-specific)

---

### A. Complications of Cough Itself (Mechanism-Based)

The physics of cough matters here. During the compressive phase, intrathoracic pressure can rise to **300 mmHg** and expiratory airflow velocity can reach **500 mph**. This creates a pressure wave that transmits simultaneously to the thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and cranium. Every complication below flows directly from this biomechanical reality.

#### 1. Musculoskeletal Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Rib fractures*** | Repetitive mechanical stress on ribs from forceful contraction of intercostal and abdominal muscles during the compressive and expulsive phases of cough. The middle ribs (5–9) along the lateral chest wall are most vulnerable because they are the thinnest and bear the greatest bending moment | Most common in **elderly, osteoporotic patients, and those on chronic corticosteroids** (e.g., COPD patients on long-term oral steroids). Often presents as localised chest wall pain exacerbated by coughing, breathing, and movement. Point tenderness over the fracture site. CXR may miss undisplaced fractures — CT is more sensitive |
| **Intercostal muscle strain** | Overuse injury of intercostal muscles from sustained forceful coughing → microscopic muscle fibre tears → inflammation → pain | Presents as pleuritic-type chest wall pain. Distinction from rib fracture: no point tenderness over bone, pain is more diffuse over the intercostal space |
| **Rectus abdominis muscle strain / tear** | Vigorous abdominal contraction during the compressive phase → strain or rupture of the rectus sheath | Presents as acute abdominal wall pain ± haematoma within the rectus sheath. Can mimic an acute abdomen if haematoma is large |

> **Why do rib fractures matter beyond pain?** A rib fracture from coughing creates a vicious cycle: the fracture causes pleuritic pain → the patient splints (avoids deep breathing and coughing to reduce pain) → sputum retention → atelectasis → secondary infection → more cough → more pain and risk of further fractures. This is why adequate analgesia is critical — you must break the cycle.

#### 2. Cardiovascular Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Cough syncope (tussive syncope)*** | Paroxysmal coughing → sustained ↑ intrathoracic pressure (similar to a Valsalva manoeuvre) → ↓ venous return to the right heart → ↓ cardiac output → transient cerebral hypoperfusion → loss of consciousness. May also involve a vasovagal component (cough stimulates vagal afferents → cardioinhibitory response → bradycardia) | More common in middle-aged men with COPD or chronic cough. Typically brief (seconds), with rapid recovery. Dangerous if occurs while driving or operating machinery. Important differential: exclude cardiac arrhythmia, aortic stenosis, and seizure disorder |
| **Cough-induced arrhythmia** | Rapid fluctuations in intrathoracic pressure → altered cardiac preload/afterload → can trigger transient arrhythmias (premature ventricular complexes, paroxysmal AF) | Usually benign and self-limiting, but can be symptomatic |
| **Subconjunctival haemorrhage** | Valsalva-like ↑ venous pressure during forceful cough → rupture of fragile conjunctival capillaries → subconjunctival extravasation of blood | Alarming in appearance (bright red eye) but benign and self-limiting. No treatment needed. Resolves over 1–3 weeks |
| **Petechiae / purpura (facial/periorbital)** | Same Valsalva mechanism → ↑ venous pressure in the head and neck → capillary rupture in skin/subcutaneous tissue | Often in the distribution of the SVC territory (face, periorbital region). Self-limiting |

<Callout title="Cough Syncope vs Seizure">
Cough syncope can be misdiagnosed as epilepsy. Key differences: cough syncope has a clear **cough trigger preceding the event**, is very brief, has no post-ictal state (rapid return to normal), and the patient is typically standing or seated. EEG and Holter monitoring can help differentiate if uncertain.

#### 3. Neurological Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Cough headache** | Coughing → ↑ intrathoracic pressure → impeded venous drainage from the cranium → transient ↑ intracranial pressure (ICP) → distension of pain-sensitive intracranial structures (meninges, venous sinuses) | Typically bilateral, explosive onset with each cough, lasting seconds to minutes. "Primary cough headache" is benign. However, must exclude **secondary causes** — particularly **Chiari type I malformation** (cerebellar tonsils herniate through foramen magnum → ↑ susceptibility to pressure changes) and posterior fossa lesions. MRI brain indicated for new-onset cough headache [15] |
| **Cervical disc herniation** | Coughing ↑ intradiscal pressure (same mechanism as Valsalva → axial loading of the spine). In pre-existing degenerative disc disease, this may precipitate acute disc prolapse | Presents with radiculopathy (neck/arm pain, dermatomal sensory loss, weakness). Important to ask about cough, sneeze, and strain as triggers |

#### 4. Abdominal and Pelvic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Urinary stress incontinence*** | Coughing → sudden ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → transmitted to the bladder → overcomes the resistance of the urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles → involuntary urine leakage | Very common in women with chronic cough, especially if pre-existing pelvic floor weakness (multiparous, post-menopausal, obesity). May be the presenting complaint that brings a chronic cough patient to seek medical attention |
| ***Inguinal hernia / abdominal wall hernia*** | Chronic coughing → repetitive ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → progressive weakening of fascial defects (inguinal canal, umbilical ring, previous surgical incisions) → herniation of abdominal contents through the defect [7] | ***Chronic cough is a recognised risk factor for inguinal hernia*** [7]. Hernia repair will have a high recurrence rate if the chronic cough is not addressed — you must treat the cough as well as the hernia |
| ***Worsening of haemorrhoids*** | Chronic cough → chronic ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → ↑ pressure in the haemorrhoidal venous plexus → engorgement and prolapse of haemorrhoidal cushions [8] | ***Chronic cough is listed as a risk factor for haemorrhoids alongside constipation, pregnancy, and obesity*** [8] |
| ***Worsening of GERD (vicious cycle)*** | Coughing → ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → overcomes LES pressure → promotes gastro-oesophageal reflux → acid in oesophagus → stimulates vagal cough reflex → more coughing [3] | ***This is the GERD-cough vicious cycle. GERD causes cough, and cough worsens GERD. Both must be treated simultaneously*** [3] |
| **Uterine prolapse (exacerbation)** | Same mechanism as stress incontinence — chronic ↑ intra-abdominal pressure on a weakened pelvic floor → descent of the uterus into the vaginal canal | Relevant in elderly women with chronic cough |

#### 5. Thoracic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Pneumothorax** | Violent coughing → alveolar rupture (especially in emphysematous blebs or bullae in COPD) → air leaks into the pleural space → pneumothorax | More common in COPD/emphysema patients (secondary spontaneous pneumothorax). Presents with sudden pleuritic chest pain + dyspnoea during a coughing episode |
| **Pneumomediastinum** | Alveolar rupture → air dissects along bronchovascular sheaths into the mediastinum → pneumomediastinum ± subcutaneous emphysema | Presents with sudden retrosternal chest pain ± subcutaneous crepitus in the neck. Usually self-limiting but must exclude oesophageal rupture (Boerhaave's syndrome — see below) |
| **Subcutaneous emphysema** | Extension of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax → air tracks into subcutaneous tissues of neck, chest wall, face | Palpable crepitus. Usually benign unless associated with tension pneumothorax |
| **Tracheobronchial injury** | Extremely rare; violent paroxysmal cough → mucosal tear in membranous trachea/bronchi | May present with haemoptysis, pneumomediastinum |

#### 6. Gastrointestinal Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Mallory-Weiss tear** | Violent retching/coughing → sudden ↑ intra-abdominal and intra-gastric pressure against a closed glottis → mucosal tear at the gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) | Presents with haematemesis following a bout of violent coughing or vomiting. Usually self-limiting (90% stop spontaneously). Endoscopic treatment if persistent |
| **Boerhaave's syndrome (oesophageal perforation)** | Extreme ↑ intra-oesophageal pressure from violent coughing/retching → full-thickness rupture of the oesophagus (usually left posterolateral distal oesophagus) | Rare but life-threatening. Presents with severe chest/epigastric pain, subcutaneous emphysema, and rapid haemodynamic deterioration. Mackler's triad: vomiting + chest pain + subcutaneous emphysema. Requires emergency surgical repair |

#### 7. Psychological and Quality-of-Life Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Sleep disturbance** | Nocturnal cough disrupts sleep architecture → insomnia, daytime somnolence, fatigue | Significant impact on quality of life and functional capacity |
| **Anxiety and depression** | Chronic, uncontrolled cough → social embarrassment, functional limitation, exhaustion, fear of serious underlying disease → psychological distress | Up to 30% of chronic cough patients report significant anxiety or depressive symptoms |
| **Social isolation** | Fear of coughing in public (especially post-COVID-19 era where coughing in public attracts stigma) → avoidance of social situations | Real and under-recognised consequence |
| **Impaired work productivity** | Chronic cough → fatigue, poor concentration, frequent medical visits → ↓ occupational performance | Economic burden — cough is one of the commonest reasons for work absenteeism |

### B. Complications of Underlying Conditions Causing Cough

Beyond the mechanical complications of coughing itself, the diseases that produce cough have their own progression and complications:

#### 1. Asthma Complications [4]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Status asthmaticus** | Severe, unrelenting bronchospasm not responding to standard therapy → progressive respiratory failure, hypoxaemia, respiratory acidosis → death if untreated |
| **Airway remodelling** | Chronic uncontrolled inflammation → subepithelial fibrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, goblet cell hyperplasia → fixed airflow obstruction (irreversible component) → overlap with COPD |
| **Pneumothorax** | Air trapping → hyperinflation → alveolar rupture |
| **Mucus plugging** | Tenacious mucus from eosinophilic inflammation → segmental atelectasis |

#### 2. COPD Complications [5]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| ***Acute exacerbation*** | Viral/bacterial infection or environmental trigger → amplified airway inflammation → ↑ cough, ↑ sputum, ↑ dyspnoea → ***if hospitalised, 5-year mortality ~50%*** [5] |
| ***Respiratory failure (Type 2)*** | Progressive airflow limitation + V/Q mismatch → chronic hypoxaemia + hypercapnia |
| ***Cor pulmonale*** | Chronic hypoxia → pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction → pulmonary hypertension → right ventricular hypertrophy and eventual right heart failure |
| **Pneumothorax** | Rupture of emphysematous bullae → secondary spontaneous pneumothorax |
| ***Lung cancer*** | Smoking is the shared risk factor; COPD itself is an independent risk factor for lung cancer (chronic inflammation → DNA damage → carcinogenesis) [5] |

#### 3. GERD Complications [3]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| ***Oesophagitis*** | Chronic acid exposure → mucosal inflammation and erosion (Los Angeles classification A–D) |
| ***Stricture*** | Chronic oesophagitis → fibrosis → luminal narrowing → dysphagia [3] |
| ***Barrett's oesophagus*** | Chronic acid damage → intestinal metaplasia of squamous epithelium to columnar epithelium at the GEJ → premalignant condition [3] |
| ***Oesophageal adenocarcinoma*** | Barrett's oesophagus → dysplasia → carcinoma sequence. Surveillance OGD recommended for Barrett's [3] |
| **Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) complications** | Chronic acid exposure to larynx → posterior laryngitis, vocal cord granulomas, subglottic stenosis, dental erosions |
| ***Aspiration pneumonia*** | Macro-aspiration of gastric contents → chemical pneumonitis → secondary bacterial infection |

#### 4. Tuberculosis Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Cavitation** | Caseous necrosis → cavity formation → communication with bronchial tree → spread of bacilli → ↑ infectivity |
| **Haemoptysis (potentially massive)** | Erosion of pulmonary artery branches (Rasmussen aneurysm) within a TB cavity → may cause fatal haemorrhage |
| **Bronchiectasis** | Healed TB → fibrosis and distortion of airways → permanent bronchial dilatation → chronic productive cough |
| **Miliary TB** | Haematogenous dissemination → diffuse miliary pattern on CXR → multi-organ involvement |
| ***TB meningitis*** | Haematogenous spread to meninges → basal meningeal adhesions → cranial nerve palsies (CN 3, 4, 6, 8), hydrocephalus → high morbidity and mortality [15] |
| **Pleural effusion / empyema** | Extension of infection to pleura → exudative effusion; caseation → empyema |
| **Aspergilloma** | Residual TB cavity becomes colonised by Aspergillus → fungus ball (mycetoma) → recurrent haemoptysis |

#### 5. Lung Cancer Complications [14]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Post-obstructive pneumonia** | Endobronchial tumour obstructs a bronchus → distal mucus retention → secondary bacterial infection → pneumonia that fails to resolve ("non-resolving pneumonia") |
| ***Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy*** | Left hilar tumour or mediastinal lymphadenopathy compresses the left recurrent laryngeal nerve (which loops under the aortic arch) → vocal cord paralysis → hoarseness + bovine cough + aspiration risk [16] |
| ***SVC obstruction*** | Tumour or lymph node mass in the right upper mediastinum compresses the SVC → impeded venous drainage from head, neck, and upper limbs → facial/neck swelling, engorged veins, plethora, dyspnoea |
| **Malignant pleural effusion** | Tumour invades or seeds the pleura → exudative effusion → cough, dyspnoea |
| ***Paraneoplastic syndromes*** | SCLC: SIADH (hyponatraemia), ectopic ACTH (Cushing's); Squamous: PTHrP (hypercalcaemia); Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome |
| **Haemoptysis** | Erosion of tumour vasculature into airways; pulmonary artery invasion in advanced disease can cause fatal haemoptysis |
| ***Pancoast syndrome*** | Apical lung tumour invading brachial plexus (C8-T1) → ipsilateral shoulder/arm pain, hand weakness/wasting + Horner's syndrome (sympathetic chain involvement: miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis) [14] |

#### 6. Heart Failure Complications (When Cough Is a Symptom of HF) [6]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Acute pulmonary oedema** | Decompensated LV failure → massive ↑ pulmonary capillary wedge pressure → transudation of fluid into alveoli → severe dyspnoea, pink frothy sputum, cough |
| **Recurrent chest infections** | Pulmonary congestion → impaired mucociliary clearance → ↓ local immune defences → ↑ susceptibility to pneumonia |
| **Atrial fibrillation** | LA dilatation from chronic mitral valve disease or LV failure → atrial remodelling → AF → ↑ risk of thromboembolism (stroke) |

#### 7. Pneumonia Complications [17]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| ***Parapneumonic effusion → empyema*** | Pleural inflammation adjacent to pneumonic consolidation → sterile exudative effusion (simple parapneumonic) → bacterial invasion of pleural space → empyema (pus in pleural space) [17] |
| ***Lung abscess*** | Necrosis within consolidated lung (especially with anaerobes, Klebsiella, S. aureus) → cavity filled with pus → presents with swinging fever, foul-smelling sputum [17] |
| ***Septicaemia and multi-organ failure*** | Bacteraemia from pneumonia → systemic inflammatory response → sepsis → septic shock → end-organ damage [17] |
| **Respiratory failure** | Extensive consolidation → V/Q mismatch → hypoxaemia (Type 1) or exhaustion/COPD → hypercapnia (Type 2) |
| ***Post-pneumonia cough persistence*** | ***Clinical resolution of SOB and systemic upset occurs in 2–3 days, but cough may persist for up to 2 weeks. Radiological resolution may be delayed up to 10 weeks in severe cases*** [17] |

#### 8. Bronchiectasis Complications [13]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|
| **Recurrent infections** | Dilated, damaged airways → mucus pooling → chronic bacterial colonisation (H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus) → vicious cycle of infection-inflammation-damage [13] |
| **Haemoptysis (potentially massive)** | Chronic inflammation → hypertrophy of bronchial arteries (systemic pressure) → erosion → haemoptysis. Can be massive and life-threatening → bronchial artery embolisation |
| **Respiratory failure** | Progressive destruction of functional lung tissue → ↓ gas exchange capacity |
| **Amyloidosis (rare)** | Chronic inflammatory stimulus → AA amyloidosis → amyloid deposition in kidneys (nephrotic syndrome), liver, spleen |

---

### C. Complications of Cough Treatment

Treatment itself can cause complications — always weigh benefit vs harm:

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Opioid antitussives (codeine, morphine)** | Sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, dependence | μ-opioid receptor agonism → central depression + ↓ GI motility |
| **Long-term PPI** | C. difficile, ↓ Ca/Mg/Fe/B12, AIN, osteoporotic fractures, rebound acid hypersecretion | Loss of gastric acid barrier; impaired mineral absorption; parietal cell hyperplasia from chronic gastrin stimulation |
| **Long-term ICS** | Oral candidiasis, dysphonia, adrenal suppression (high doses), pneumonia risk in COPD | Local immunosuppression → Candida overgrowth; systemic absorption at high doses → HPA axis suppression |
| **Long-term oral corticosteroids** | Osteoporosis → rib fractures (ironic: treating asthma/COPD may predispose to cough-related rib fracture), adrenal suppression, DM, immunosuppression | Catabolic effects on bone; ↑ gluconeogenesis; ↓ immune function |
| ***Anti-TB drugs*** | Hepatotoxicity (INH, RIF, PZA), optic neuritis (EMB), peripheral neuropathy (INH), hyperuricaemia (PZA) | Drug-specific mechanisms as detailed in management section |
| **1st-gen antihistamines** | Sedation, falls in elderly, urinary retention, dry mouth | Central anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Cough">

1. **Cough generates intrathoracic pressures up to 300 mmHg** — this is the root cause of most mechanical complications.

2. **Tussive syncope**: ↑ intrathoracic pressure → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac output → cerebral hypoperfusion. More common in COPD. Must exclude cardiac arrhythmia and seizure.

3. **Rib fractures**: Common in elderly/osteoporotic patients. Creates a vicious cycle: pain → splinting → sputum retention → infection → more cough. Break the cycle with adequate analgesia.

4. **Stress incontinence**: Very common in women with chronic cough. ↑ intra-abdominal pressure overwhelms pelvic floor.

5. **GERD-cough vicious cycle**: Cough → ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → ↑ reflux → more cough. Both must be treated simultaneously.

6. **Chronic cough → inguinal hernia, haemorrhoids**: Chronic ↑ intra-abdominal pressure weakens fascial planes and engorges haemorrhoidal plexus.

7. **Cough headache**: Usually benign "primary cough headache," but must exclude Chiari I malformation and posterior fossa lesions with MRI.

8. **Pneumothorax**: Alveolar rupture from violent cough, especially in COPD/emphysema.

9. **COPD complications**: Acute exacerbation (50% 5-year mortality if hospitalised), cor pulmonale, respiratory failure, lung cancer.

10. **TB complications**: Haemoptysis (Rasmussen aneurysm), bronchiectasis, miliary spread, TB meningitis, aspergilloma in residual cavity.

11. **Treatment complications**: Long-term PPI → C. difficile, osteoporosis; ICS → oral candidiasis, pneumonia in COPD; opioid antitussives → respiratory depression, dependence.

      markscheme: "Most likely: cough-related rib fracture. CXR may miss undisplaced fractures -- CT is more sensitive. Clinical significance: creates a vicious cycle of pain leading to splinting, reduced deep breathing and cough suppression, causing sputum retention, atelectasis, secondary infection, and more coughing. Adequate analgesia is essential to break this cycle."

      question: "Describe the GERD-cough vicious cycle and explain why both conditions must be treated simultaneously.",
      markscheme: "GERD causes cough via micro-aspiration, oesophago-bronchial vagal reflex, and cough reflex sensitisation. Coughing increases intra-abdominal pressure, which promotes further gastro-oesophageal reflux by overcoming LES pressure. This creates a self-perpetuating cycle. Both must be treated simultaneously: PPI plus lifestyle modifications for GERD, and antitussive or cause-directed therapy for cough, otherwise neither improves adequately."

      question: "A patient with new-onset cough headache is referred to you. What is the key differential you must exclude and how?",
      markscheme: "Must exclude Chiari type I malformation (cerebellar tonsils herniate through foramen magnum, making the posterior fossa more susceptible to transient intracranial pressure changes from coughing). Also exclude other posterior fossa lesions. Investigation: MRI brain. Primary cough headache is a diagnosis of exclusion after structural causes are ruled out."
    },
    {
      question: "List three complications that arise specifically from chronic increase in intra-abdominal pressure due to cough, and explain the mechanism for each.",
