## Diagnostic Criteria

Palpitations themselves have no formal "diagnostic criteria" — they are a symptom, not a disease. The diagnostic process is about **identifying the underlying cause**. However, several specific diagnoses that present *with* palpitations do have formal criteria, and you need to know them.

### When Is the Diagnosis "Just Palpitations" (Benign)?

A diagnosis of benign or functional palpitations is essentially one of exclusion. You can be reasonably confident the palpitations are benign when:

1. **History** is consistent with ectopics or anxiety (gradual onset, no syncope, no red flags)
2. **Resting ECG** is normal (no delta wave, no prolonged QT, no ST changes, no structural abnormalities)
3. **Basic bloods** are normal (no anaemia, normal electrolytes, normal TFTs, normal glucose)
4. **No structural heart disease** on examination or echocardiography
5. **No red flag features**: syncope, exertional palpitations, FHx of SCD < 40y, known cardiomyopathy

<Callout title="The Real Question" type="idea">
The diagnostic criteria you need to know are not for "palpitations" per se, but for the *specific arrhythmias and conditions* that cause them. The diagnostic workup is a systematic process of elimination guided by clinical probability.
</Callout>

### Diagnostic Criteria for Key Underlying Conditions

#### A. Atrial Fibrillation (AF)
- **ECG criteria**: Absence of consistent P waves, replaced by fibrillatory waves (irregular baseline undulations); irregularly irregular RR intervals; narrow QRS (unless coexistent BBB or pre-excitation)
- **Duration classification**: Paroxysmal ( < 7 days, self-terminating), Persistent (>7 days or requiring cardioversion), Long-standing persistent ( > 12 months), Permanent (accepted by patient and clinician)
- A single-lead ECG recording of ≥30 seconds showing AF is sufficient for diagnosis (2024 ESC guidelines)

#### B. Panic Disorder (DSM-5) [6]

> ***A. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e. an abrupt surge of intense fear/discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and during which time ≥4 of following symptoms occur:*** [6]
> ***(1) Palpitations, pounding heart or ↑HR (2) Sweating (3) Trembling or shaking (4) Sensations of SOB or smothering (5) Feelings of choking (6) Chest pain or discomfort (7) Nausea or abdominal distress (8) Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint (9) Chills or heat sensations (10) Paraesthesias (11) Derealization or depersonalization (12) Fear of losing control or 'going crazy' (13) Fear of dying*** [6]
> ***B. ≥1 attacks has been followed by ≥1mo of ≥1 of following: (1) persistent concern/worry about additional panic attacks or their consequences (2) a significant maladaptive change in behaviour related to the attacks*** [6]
> ***C. Not attributable to substance or another medical condition*** [6]
> ***D. Not better explained by another mental disorder*** [6]

Note: Criterion C is critical — you must exclude organic causes (thyrotoxicosis, phaeochromocytoma, arrhythmias, hypoglycaemia) before diagnosing panic disorder. Palpitations are literally criterion A(1).

#### C. Myocardial Infarction — 4th Universal Definition (2018) [17]

Relevant because ***MI/angina*** [3] is a "serious disorder not to be missed":

> ***Detection of rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values (preferably cTn) with ≥1 value above 99th URL; plus ≥1 of: (1) Symptoms of ischaemia (2) New or presumed new significant ST-T changes or new LBBB (3) Development of pathological Q waves (4) Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new RWMA (5) Identification of an intracoronary thrombus*** [17]

#### D. ECG Diagnostic Criteria for Key Arrhythmias

| Arrhythmia | ECG Criteria | Why These Features Occur |
|---|---|---|
| **Sinus tachycardia** | Rate > 100 bpm, normal P before every QRS, normal P-axis (upright in II, inverted in aVR) | SA node fires faster → same P morphology, just more frequent |
| **APB** | Premature P wave with abnormal morphology ± compensatory pause; narrow QRS | Ectopic atrial focus fires early → P looks different because the depolarisation vector originates from a different site |
| **VPB** | Premature wide QRS ( > 120ms) without preceding P wave; compensatory pause; discordant T wave | Ectopic ventricular focus → slow cell-to-cell conduction (no Purkinje) → wide QRS; T wave opposite to QRS direction |
| ***AF*** | ***No P waves, irregular fibrillatory baseline, irregularly irregular RR intervals*** | Multiple chaotic re-entrant wavelets → no organised atrial depolarisation → random ventricular activation through AV node |
| **AFL** | Sawtooth flutter waves (best seen in II, III, aVF, V1) at ~300/min; regular ventricular rate (usually 2:1 block → ~150 bpm) | Macro-re-entry around tricuspid annulus → rhythmic atrial depolarisation at fixed rate |
| ***AVNRT*** | Narrow complex, regular, 150–250 bpm; ***P waves buried in QRS or just after (pseudo-R' in V1, pseudo-S in inferior leads)*** | Simultaneous atrial and ventricular activation because circuit is so compact that retrograde P occurs during QRS |
| ***AVRT (WPW)*** | During sinus rhythm: ***short PR ( < 120ms), delta wave (slurred QRS upstroke), wide QRS***. During orthodromic AVRT: narrow complex SVT with retrograde P after QRS | Delta wave = pre-excitation via accessory pathway bypassing AV node delay; during AVRT, the circuit uses AV node antegradely (narrow QRS) and accessory pathway retrogradely |
| ***VT*** | ***Wide QRS ( > 120ms), rate > 100 bpm, AV dissociation, capture beats, fusion beats, concordance across precordial leads*** | Ventricular origin → cell-to-cell conduction without Purkinje → wide QRS; atria and ventricles depolarise independently (AV dissociation) |
| ***Long QT*** | ***QTc > 500ms (significant risk), > 470ms in males or > 480ms in females*** (Bazett correction: QTc = QT / √RR) | Delayed ventricular repolarisation from K⁺/Na⁺ channelopathy → ↑window for early afterdepolarisations → TdP |
| **TdP** | Polymorphic VT with sinusoidal oscillation of QRS axis ("twisting of the points") on a background of prolonged QT | EADs trigger polymorphic VT; rotating axis because activation wavefront shifts continuously |
| ***Brugada*** | Coved ST elevation ≥2mm in V1–V3 followed by negative T wave (Type 1 = diagnostic) | Na⁺ channel dysfunction → transmural voltage gradient during repolarisation → predisposition to VF |

---

## Diagnostic Algorithm

The approach to a patient presenting with palpitations follows a structured pathway that moves from clinical assessment → risk stratification → targeted investigations.

<Callout title="The Golden Rule of Palpitation Diagnosis">
The single most valuable diagnostic event is capturing an **ECG during symptoms**. A normal ECG *during* palpitations essentially excludes arrhythmia as the cause. A normal ECG *between* episodes tells you relatively little — it only excludes resting abnormalities like WPW pattern, prolonged QT, or structural changes.
</Callout>

## Investigation Modalities

### A. First-Line Investigations — The "Palpitations Checklist"

> ***A checklist includes: FBE, TFTs, serum glucose, urea, electrolytes and magnesium, ECG, cardiac enzymes, echocardiography, Holter monitoring*** [3]

Let's go through each systematically, explaining *why* each test is ordered and *what* you're looking for.

---

#### 1. 12-Lead ECG

**Why it's done**: The single most important first-line investigation. It gives you a snapshot of the heart's electrical activity *right now*.

**When to do it**: Every patient presenting with palpitations. Ideally during symptoms — this is diagnostic gold.

> ***The ideal time to examine the patient is during the palpitations. If not, the examination is usually normal*** [3]

**Key findings and their interpretation**:

| ECG Finding | Diagnosis Suggested | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| Normal sinus rhythm | Symptoms may be benign; does NOT exclude paroxysmal arrhythmia | Between attacks, conduction system functions normally |
| Sinus tachycardia | Secondary cause (fever, anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, drugs) | ↑SA node automaticity from sympathetic drive |
| Delta wave + short PR | ***WPW syndrome*** [3] — even if asymptomatic at time of ECG | Accessory pathway conducts faster than AV node → pre-excitation (delta wave = early slow ventricular activation before His-Purkinje catches up) |
| Prolonged QTc | ***Long QT syndrome*** [3]; drugs; ***hypoK, hypoMg*** [3] | Delayed repolarisation → ↑risk of EADs → TdP |
| Ectopic beats (APB/VPB) | ***Premature beats*** [3] — most common cause of palpitations | Ectopic focus fires prematurely |
| AF pattern | ***Atrial fibrillation*** [3] | Chaotic atrial activation |
| Flutter waves | ***Atrial flutter*** [3] | Organised macro-re-entry in RA |
| Wide complex tachycardia | ***VT*** until proven otherwise | Ventricular origin or SVT with aberrancy |
| ST changes | ***MI/ischaemia*** [3] | Myocardial injury current |
| LVH criteria | HCMP, hypertensive heart disease → substrate for arrhythmia | ↑LV mass → ↑voltage on ECG |
| Giant T-wave inversions in precordial leads | Apical HCMP (high prevalence in HK) | Apical hypertrophy creates repolarisation abnormality |
| Brugada pattern (coved ST in V1-3) | Brugada syndrome | Na⁺ channel dysfunction → repolarisation abnormality |
| Epsilon waves in V1-V3 | ARVC (arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy) | Fatty/fibrotic replacement of RV myocardium → delayed RV activation |

**Technical note on ECG interpretation** [18]:
- ***Speed = 25mm/s (1s = 5 large squares) → Rate = 300 / number of large squares between R-R*** [18]
- ***Amplitude = 1mV/cm (2 large squares = 1mV)*** [18]
- ***Limb leads look at heart in frontal plane; Chest leads in horizontal plane*** [18]
- ***Cardiac rhythm identified from whichever lead showing P wave most clearly (usually lead II)*** [18]

---

#### 2. Blood Tests

##### a. ***FBE (Full Blood Examination / CBC)*** [3]

**Why**: To detect ***anaemia*** [3] — a common and easily treatable masquerade.

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| ↓Hb | Anaemia → hyperdynamic circulation → sinus tachycardia / ↑awareness of heartbeat |
| ↑WCC | Infection/fever → sinus tachycardia |
| ↓Platelets or ↑Platelets | Haematological disorder; thrombocytosis → reactive (IDA causes reactive thrombocytosis [19]) |

##### b. ***TFTs (Thyroid Function Tests)*** [3]

**Why**: ***Consider hyperthyroidism as a cause of atrial fibrillation or sinus tachycardia even if the clinical manifestations are not apparent*** [3]. This is the single most commonly missed endocrine cause.

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| ↓TSH, ↑fT4 | Overt thyrotoxicosis → AF, sinus tachycardia, ectopics, ↑contractility |
| ↓TSH, normal fT4/T3 | Subclinical hyperthyroidism — still a risk factor for AF, especially in elderly |
| ↑TSH, ↓fT4 | Hypothyroidism — can cause bradycardia (less commonly palpitations, but important) |

> ***Diagnostic Ix: by TFT (TSH most sensitive). ↓TSH ↑T3 ↑fT4: diagnostic of thyrotoxicosis (TSH usually undetectable)*** [20]

##### c. ***Serum Glucose*** [3]

**Why**: ***Hypoglycaemia (type 1 diabetes)*** [3] causes adrenergic symptoms including ***palpitation, sweating, anxiety, tremor, tachycardia*** [15].

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| < 3.9 mmol/L (with symptoms) | Hypoglycaemia → counter-regulatory catecholamine surge → sinus tachycardia |
| Elevated | DM → check for DKA (can cause hypoK → arrhythmia) |

##### d. ***Urea, Electrolytes and Magnesium*** [3]

**Why**: ***Hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia*** [3] are the electrolyte disturbances that most commonly cause arrhythmias.

| Finding | Interpretation | Arrhythmia Risk |
|---|---|---|
| ***↓K⁺ ( < 3.5 mmol/L)*** | Diuretics, vomiting, diarrhoea, RTA, Conn's syndrome | ↑Resting membrane potential → delayed repolarisation → ↑QT → U waves → ectopics, VT, TdP |
| ***↓Mg²⁺ ( < 0.7 mmol/L)*** | Often coexists with hypoK; diuretics, alcohol, PPI use | Mg²⁺ stabilises K⁺ channels; depletion → refractory hypoK + independent pro-arrhythmic effect |
| ↑K⁺ ( > 5.5 mmol/L) | Renal failure, K-sparing diuretics, DKA, ACEi/ARBs | ***ECG changes: 6-7 mmol/L (tall peaked T), 8-10 (wide QRS), 11 (sine wave), 10-12 (VF)*** [21] |
| ↑Urea/Cr | Renal failure → hyper/hypoK, fluid overload → HF → palpitations | Uraemia is itself pro-arrhythmic |
| ↓Ca²⁺ | Hypoparathyroidism, CKD, massive transfusion | Prolonged QT → risk of TdP |

##### e. ***Cardiac Enzymes*** [3]

**Why**: To exclude ***MI/angina*** [3] when palpitations are associated with chest pain or haemodynamic compromise.

| Marker | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| ↑hs-cTnI/T (rise and/or fall with at least 1 value > 99th percentile URL) | Myocardial injury — Type 1 MI (ACS) vs Type 2 MI (demand ischaemia from tachyarrhythmia) [17] |
| ↑NT-proBNP/BNP | Heart failure — particularly if palpitations are from tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy or AF with fast ventricular rate |

<Callout title="Type 2 MI in Tachyarrhythmia" type="error">
A sustained tachycardia itself can cause troponin elevation (Type 2 MI) through supply-demand mismatch — ↑HR → ↓diastolic time → ↓coronary perfusion + ↑myocardial O₂ demand. This does NOT necessarily mean the patient has ACS. Context is everything.
</Callout>

---

#### 3. ***Echocardiography*** [3]

**Why**: To assess for structural heart disease — the substrate for many dangerous arrhythmias.

**Indications**: Not needed for every patient with palpitations. Order when:
- Suspected structural heart disease (abnormal examination, abnormal ECG)
- Syncope or presyncope with palpitations
- Sustained tachyarrhythmia documented
- Murmur on examination
- Young patient with FHx of SCD or cardiomyopathy

| Finding | Diagnosis | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Asymmetric septal hypertrophy (ASH) + SAM | HCMP | Substrate for VT/VF and AF; risk of SCD |
| Apical hypertrophy with spade-like LV cavity | Apical HCMP (HK-relevant) | Usually more benign than obstructive HCMP |
| Dilated LV with ↓LVEF | DCMP | Substrate for VT; risk of thromboembolism |
| Mitral stenosis with ↑LA size | Rheumatic MS → AF | LA dilatation provides substrate for AF |
| Mitral valve prolapse with MR | MVP | Associated with ectopics, SVT, rarely VT |
| Aortic regurgitation | AR → hyperdynamic palpitations | Wide pulse pressure → forceful beats |
| RV dilatation with fatty infiltration | ARVC | Substrate for RV-origin VT |
| Regional wall motion abnormalities | Prior MI → scar-related VT | Re-entrant VT around scar |

---

#### 4. ***Holter Monitoring*** [3] (Ambulatory ECG)

**Why**: Most palpitations are paroxysmal — the resting ECG will be normal. You need to *catch* the arrhythmia in the act.

**Principle**: Continuous ECG recording over 24–48 hours (or up to 7 days with extended Holter) while the patient goes about daily life. Patient keeps a *diary* noting when symptoms occur → allows correlation of symptoms with rhythm.

**Key point**: The diagnostic yield depends on symptom frequency:
- **Daily symptoms** → 24h Holter is appropriate (yield ~50%)
- **Weekly symptoms** → Extended Holter (7-day) or event recorder (yield improves to 65-85%)
- **Monthly or less frequent** → External loop recorder (2-4 weeks) or implantable loop recorder (ILR)

| Holter Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Symptoms + arrhythmia at same time | **Diagnostic correlation** — the arrhythmia is the cause |
| Symptoms + normal rhythm at same time | **Arrhythmia excluded** as cause → think non-arrhythmic DDx (anxiety, hyperdynamic, etc.) |
| Arrhythmia present but no symptoms | Arrhythmia exists but is not the cause of patient's symptoms (incidental) |
| No symptoms + no arrhythmia | **Non-diagnostic** — extend monitoring duration |
| Frequent ectopics ( > 10% burden on 24h Holter) | May indicate risk of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy; consider treatment |

---

#### 5. Event Recorders and Implantable Loop Recorders (ILR)

**Event recorder (external)**:
- Patient-activated device worn for 2-4 weeks
- When symptoms occur, patient presses a button → device saves the preceding 30-60 seconds and the following 30-60 seconds of ECG
- **Advantage**: Much longer monitoring window than Holter
- **Limitation**: patient must be conscious and able to activate

**Implantable loop recorder (ILR)** (e.g., LINQ device):
- Small device implanted subcutaneously in the left parasternal area under local anaesthesia
- Continuous monitoring for up to **3 years**
- Auto-detects arrhythmias + patient can activate during symptoms
- **Indication**: Infrequent but clinically significant episodes (especially syncope with suspected arrhythmia), after non-diagnostic Holter/event recorder
- **Yield**: Up to 90% diagnostic yield for recurrent unexplained syncope

---

### B. Second-Line / Targeted Investigations

These are not done routinely for all patients but are directed by clinical suspicion.

#### 6. Exercise Stress Testing (EST)

**Why**: For palpitations that are ***exercise-induced*** — ***During exercise: think PSVT, AF and VT*** [1][2]

**Principle**: Graded exercise on treadmill or bicycle with continuous ECG monitoring. Provokes arrhythmias that are catecholamine-dependent.

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| SVT induced by exercise | Catecholamine-sensitive SVT |
| VT induced by exercise | Structural heart disease (post-MI scar VT) or catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT) — very important in young patients with exertional syncope |
| ST depression with exercise | Ischaemia → demand ischaemia as cause of palpitations |
| Inappropriate sinus tachycardia | Consider IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia syndrome) |

#### 7. Electrophysiology Study (EPS)

**Why**: The definitive invasive test to characterise arrhythmia mechanism. Catheters are placed inside the heart to map the electrical activation and provoke arrhythmias in a controlled setting.

**Indications**:
- Pre-ablation mapping (AVNRT, AVRT/WPW, AFL, VT)
- Risk stratification (e.g., inducible VT in post-MI patients)
- When non-invasive monitoring has failed to capture the arrhythmia but clinical suspicion remains high

**What it tells you**: Exact mechanism (re-entry vs automaticity vs triggered), location of the circuit/focus, suitability for catheter ablation

#### 8. Cardiac MRI (CMR)

**Why**: The gold standard for myocardial tissue characterisation — particularly useful for:

| Indication | What CMR Shows |
|---|---|
| HCMP evaluation | Distribution and degree of hypertrophy, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) = fibrosis/scar = substrate for VT |
| ARVC evaluation | Fatty infiltration of RV, RV dilatation, wall motion abnormalities (modified Task Force criteria for ARVC) |
| Myocarditis | Oedema (acute inflammation) + LGE in mid-wall/epicardial pattern (cf. subendocardial in ischaemia) |
| DCMP evaluation | Degree of dilatation, LGE pattern, aetiological clues |
| Sarcoidosis | LGE in basal septum — cardiac sarcoid is a cause of VT and heart block |

#### 9. Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) [22]

**Why**: When ischaemia is suspected as the driver of palpitations (exercise-induced symptoms, risk factors for CAD).

> ***Indication: screening and diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Determine adequacy of blood flow ± stress (functional in nature → detect a haemodynamically significant anatomical endpoint, i.e., flow-limiting coronary stenosis defined by ≥50% diameter stenosis)*** [22]

- ***At rest, partial coronary stenosis limits blood flow but collaterals + vasodilation maintain perfusion*** [22]
- ***With stress, vessels supplying normal myocardium also dilate → blood siphoned away from affected territory ('coronary steal') → cold spots*** [22]
- ***Ischaemia → cold spots with stress only; Infarct → cold spots at rest AND stress*** [22]

#### 10. Specific Endocrine Investigations

##### Phaeochromocytoma workup (when clinical suspicion: ***classic triad of headache + sweating + palpitation*** [9])

> ***Biopsy is NOT required: high risk of hypertensive crisis and haematoma*** [10]

| Test | Details | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| ***24h urine catecholamines + fractionated metanephrines*** [10] | ***Most sensitive (continuous release). Abnormal if > 2× elevation. False positives: stress, OSA, drugs (TCA, α-agonist, levodopa → stop 1 week)*** [10] | Sens 98% Spec 98% [9] |
| ***Plasma fractionated metanephrines*** [10] | ***Most specific but needs indwelling catheter > 30min. Preferred in chronic renal failure*** [10] | Sens 96-100% Spec 85-89% [9] |
| ***CT with low-osmolar contrast / T2-MRI*** [10] | Anatomical localisation. ***CT: alpha blockade prior to IV contrast due to risk of HT crisis. Low-osmolar contrast safe even without alpha/beta blockade*** [10] | Localise adrenal or extra-adrenal tumour |
| ***I-123 MIBG scan*** [10] | ***MIBG = metaiodobenzylguanidine, NE analog taken up by phaeochromocytoma*** [10] | Functional localisation, especially for extra-adrenal or metastatic disease |
| ***68Ga-DOTATATE PET-CT*** [10] | Detect metastatic disease | Superior sensitivity for metastatic phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma |

##### Thyrotoxicosis workup [20]

| Test | Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| ***TSH (most sensitive)*** [20] | ↓TSH (usually undetectable in overt thyrotoxicosis) | Screening test of choice |
| ***fT4, T3*** | ↑fT4 ± ↑T3 | Confirms thyrotoxicosis |
| ***TRAb (anti-TSHr)*** | Positive | Specific for Graves' disease; prognostic for relapse [20] |
| ***Thyroid scintigraphy*** | ***Diffuse ↑uptake = Graves'; heterogeneous ↑uptake = toxic MNG; focal ↑uptake = toxic adenoma; diffuse ↓uptake = destructive thyroiditis vs factitious*** [20] | Aetiological differentiation when clinically uncertain |

##### Hypoglycaemia workup

> ***Diagnosis confirmed by Whipple's triad: (1) Symptoms compatible with hypoglycaemia, (2) Low blood glucose coinciding with time of symptoms, (3) Resolution of symptoms with correction of hypoglycaemia*** [15]

---

### C. Investigation Selection Algorithm (Symptom-Frequency Based)

| Symptom Frequency | Best Monitoring Strategy | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Symptoms occurring NOW** | 12-lead ECG immediately | Capture the arrhythmia in real-time — diagnostic gold |
| **Daily or near-daily** | 24-48h Holter | High probability of capturing an event within recording window |
| **Weekly** | 7-day extended Holter or external event recorder | Need longer monitoring to catch infrequent events |
| **Monthly** | External loop recorder (2-4 weeks) | Even longer window; patient-activated |
| **Very infrequent / unexplained syncope** | Implantable loop recorder (ILR) | Up to 3 years of continuous monitoring |
| **Exercise-triggered** | Exercise stress test | Reproduce the arrhythmia under controlled conditions |
| **Suspected structural heart disease** | Echocardiography ± Cardiac MRI | Assess substrate (hypertrophy, scar, dilatation, valvular disease) |
| **High suspicion, non-diagnostic non-invasive** | Electrophysiology study (EPS) | Definitive invasive characterisation and potential ablation |

---

### Summary of Key Investigation Findings by Diagnosis

| Suspected Diagnosis | Key Investigations | Diagnostic Finding |
|---|---|---|

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **No formal diagnostic criteria for "palpitations"** — the diagnosis is about identifying the underlying cause.

2. **12-lead ECG** is the single most important first-line investigation. A normal ECG *during symptoms* essentially excludes arrhythmia. A normal ECG *between episodes* only excludes resting abnormalities (WPW pattern, prolonged QT, structural changes).

3. **Murtagh's investigation checklist**: FBE, TFTs, serum glucose, U&E + Mg, ECG, cardiac enzymes, echocardiography, Holter monitoring.

4. **Ambulatory monitoring choice depends on symptom frequency**: Daily → Holter; Weekly → extended Holter/event recorder; Monthly → external loop recorder; Very infrequent → ILR.

5. **The diagnostic correlation**: Symptoms + arrhythmia simultaneously = diagnostic. Symptoms + normal rhythm = arrhythmia excluded. Arrhythmia + no symptoms = incidental finding.

6. **Always check TFTs** — even in patients without obvious thyrotoxic features. Thyrotoxicosis is the great imitator and a common cause of AF.

7. **ECG red flags on resting ECG**: Delta wave (WPW), prolonged QTc (LQTS/drugs/electrolytes), Brugada pattern, LVH (HCMP), epsilon waves (ARVC), Q waves (prior MI scar → VT substrate).

8. **Phaeochromocytoma**: Biopsy is NEVER done. Diagnosis by 24h urine fractionated metanephrines (Sens 98%). Localise by CT/MRI + MIBG scan.

9. **Panic disorder diagnosis (DSM-5)**: Requires recurrent unexpected panic attacks with ≥4/13 symptoms + ≥1 month of worry/behavioural change + exclusion of organic causes + not better explained by another mental disorder.

T3/T4 increase beta-1 receptor expression on cardiomyocytes, increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity shortening atrial refractory period, and decrease SVR creating a hyperdynamic state, all of which facilitate AF. Treating the thyrotoxicosis may restore sinus rhythm without the need for antiarrhythmics.",

    {
      question: "How do you biochemically diagnose phaeochromocytoma? Name the preferred screening test, its sensitivity, and one important precaution.",
      markscheme: "24h urine for fractionated metanephrines is the preferred screening test (Sens 98%, Spec 98%). Important precaution: stop drugs affecting catecholamine secretion (e.g., TCAs, levodopa, alpha-agonists, amphetamines) at least 1 week prior. Biopsy is NEVER performed due to risk of hypertensive crisis and haematoma.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are the three possible outcomes when correlating symptoms with ambulatory ECG monitoring, and what does each mean clinically?",
      markscheme: "(1) Symptoms present + arrhythmia recorded simultaneously = diagnostic correlation, arrhythmia is the cause. (2) Symptoms present + normal rhythm recorded = arrhythmia excluded as cause, consider non-arrhythmic differential (anxiety, hyperdynamic state). (3) Arrhythmia recorded + no symptoms = incidental finding, arrhythmia exists but is not causing the patient's palpitations.",
