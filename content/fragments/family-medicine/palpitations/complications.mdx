## Complications of Palpitations and Their Underlying Causes

When we talk about "complications of palpitations," we are really discussing the complications of the *underlying arrhythmias and conditions* that produce the symptom. Palpitations themselves — the subjective awareness of the heartbeat — cannot directly harm a patient. But the arrhythmias and diseases behind them absolutely can. Think of it like this: the palpitation is the smoke alarm; the complications come from the fire.

The complications are best understood by grouping them according to the pathophysiological mechanism through which they cause harm.

---

### 1. Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)

This is the most feared complication and the reason we take palpitations seriously.

| Cause | Mechanism of SCD | Who Is at Risk |
|---|---|---|
| ***VT degenerating to VF*** [13] | Sustained VT → haemodynamic collapse → ischaemia → electrical instability → VF → no cardiac output → death. ***VF = totally uncoordinated contraction of ventricles*** [13] | Post-MI patients with myocardial scar, DCMP (LVEF ≤ 35%), HCMP, ARVC |
| ***WPW with AF*** [3] | Accessory pathway conducts AF impulses to ventricle without AV nodal delay → ventricular rate > 300 bpm → VF | ***WPW syndrome*** [3] — young, otherwise healthy patients |
| ***Torsades de Pointes (TdP)*** [3] | Prolonged QT → early afterdepolarisations → polymorphic VT → may self-terminate or degenerate to VF | ***Long QT syndrome*** [3], drugs that prolong QT, ***hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia*** [3] |
| ***Brugada syndrome*** | Na⁺ channel dysfunction → transmural voltage gradient → VF, typically during sleep or fever | Young Asian males (high prevalence in South-East Asia); palpitations or syncope may precede SCD |
| ***HCMP*** | Dynamic LVOT obstruction + disorganised myocardial architecture → VT/VF, especially during exertion | ***Typically during or after vigorous physical activity*** — most common cause of SCD in athletes < 35y |

> ***Cardiac arrest causes: CAD (85%), structural heart disease (10%: AS, HCM, DCM, ARVD, congenital HD), Others (5%: LQTS, Brugada syndrome, WPWS, drug-induced TdP, severe electrolyte imbalance)*** [13]

**Why this matters**: A young patient presenting with exertional palpitations and a family history of sudden death under 40 is a medical emergency until you prove otherwise. The palpitation may be the *only* warning before a lethal arrhythmia.

<Callout title="SCD Prevention" type="error">
Patients at high risk of SCD (survived VT/VF, LVEF ≤ 35% with HF, high-risk HCMP, high-risk channelopathy) require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). The ICD detects VT/VF and delivers an internal shock within seconds — this is the single most effective intervention for preventing SCD in high-risk patients.

### 2. Thromboembolism and Stroke

The most clinically significant complication of atrial arrhythmias, especially ***atrial fibrillation*** [3].

**Pathophysiology of AF-related stroke**:

The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a muscular pouch in the left atrium. During normal sinus rhythm, the LAA contracts vigorously and empties with each heartbeat. In AF:
1. **Loss of coordinated atrial contraction** → blood stasis in the LAA
2. **Virchow's triad activated**: stasis (✓), endothelial injury (atrial remodelling ✓), hypercoagulable state (inflammatory mediators ✓)
3. **Thrombus forms** in the LAA (90% of AF-related thrombi originate here)
4. **Embolisation** → most commonly to the brain (MCA territory) → ischaemic stroke

| Complication | Arrhythmia | Magnitude of Risk | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ischaemic stroke** | AF | 5-fold ↑ risk; AF accounts for 15-20% of all strokes | Thrombus from LAA → cerebral embolism. Strokes tend to be large and disabling because embolus occludes major vessels |
| **Ischaemic stroke** | AFL | Similar risk to AF | Same stasis mechanism; AFL often coexists with AF |
| **Systemic embolism** | AF | Renal, mesenteric, limb arteries | Same thrombotic source → any arterial territory |
| **Paradoxical embolism** | AF + PFO | Venous thrombus crosses PFO to arterial circulation | Patent foramen ovale creates right-to-left shunt, especially during Valsalva → venous emboli reach systemic circulation |

> ***ECG for cardiac abnormalities (eg. AF)*** is part of the stroke workup [30] — because identifying AF changes management entirely (anticoagulation)

**Prevention**: Anticoagulation guided by CHA₂DS₂-VASc score. DOACs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) are preferred over warfarin for non-valvular AF. Left atrial appendage occlusion (e.g., Watchman device) for patients who cannot tolerate anticoagulation.

### 3. Heart Failure

Arrhythmias cause or exacerbate heart failure through multiple mechanisms.

#### A. Tachycardia-Mediated Cardiomyopathy (Tachycardiomyopathy)

This is a critically important and *reversible* complication.

**Pathophysiology**: Any sustained tachycardia (AF with fast ventricular rate, incessant SVT, frequent VPBs) → chronic ↑HR → ↑myocardial O₂ demand + ↓diastolic filling time + ↓coronary perfusion → myocardial energy depletion → progressive LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction → clinical HF.

> ***Tachycardia-mediated*** cardiomyopathy is listed as a cause of ***DCMP*** — ***due to uncontrolled tachycardia*** [31]

**Key features**:
- The cardiomyopathy can develop from *any* sustained tachyarrhythmia, even seemingly benign ones like frequent VPBs ( > 10-15% burden)
- **Reversible**: LVEF can normalise completely after rate/rhythm control or ablation — this is why identifying and treating the arrhythmia is crucial
- Should be suspected whenever a patient presents with new HF + uncontrolled arrhythmia, especially if no other obvious HF aetiology

#### B. AF-Related Heart Failure

- AF causes HF through: (1) loss of atrial kick (contributes ~25% of CO; even more important in diastolic dysfunction), (2) irregularity itself ↓cardiac efficiency, (3) tachycardiomyopathy if rate uncontrolled
- HF causes AF through: atrial dilatation → atrial fibrosis → AF substrate → "AF begets HF begets AF" vicious cycle

#### C. Bradycardia-Related Heart Failure

- Severe bradycardia → ↓CO → forward failure (fatigue, syncope, renal impairment) + backward failure (congestion)
- Particularly in complete heart block with slow ventricular escape ( < 40 bpm)

#### D. Diastolic Dysfunction in HCMP

> ***Diastolic dysfunction: contributing factor in 80% of pts*** [32]
> ***↓Compliance → ↓diastolic filling → ↑LV end-diastolic pressure → ↑pulmonary venous pressure → accounts for exertional dyspnoea*** [32]

When AF develops in HCMP (occurs in ~30%), the loss of atrial kick is catastrophic because the stiff, hypertrophied ventricle is highly dependent on active atrial contraction for filling → acute HF exacerbation.

---

### 4. Haemodynamic Compromise and Syncope

Arrhythmias can cause syncope through ↓cerebral perfusion.

| Arrhythmia | Mechanism of Syncope |
|---|---|
| **Sustained VT** | Very rapid rate → ↓diastolic filling → ↓stroke volume → ↓CO → ↓cerebral perfusion |
| **Complete heart block** | Ventricular escape rate too slow ( < 40 bpm) to maintain adequate CO |
| ***Sick sinus syndrome (tachy-brady)*** [3] | ***During tachyarrhythmia, there is overdrive suppression of SA node → period of sinus arrest following termination of tachyarrhythmia*** [14] → the pause causes syncope |
| **HCMP with dynamic LVOT obstruction** | ***LVOT obstruction worsens with exertion → exertional syncope*** [32] |
| **Pre-excited AF in WPW** | Extremely rapid ventricular rate → ↓filling → ↓CO → syncope → may progress to VF |
| **TdP** | Self-terminating bursts → recurrent syncope; sustained → VF → cardiac arrest |

**Why syncope during palpitations is a red flag**: It implies that the arrhythmia is haemodynamically significant — the heart is failing to maintain cerebral perfusion. This dramatically increases the probability of a dangerous arrhythmia (VT, VF, high-degree block, pre-excited AF) and the risk of SCD.

---

### 5. Myocardial Ischaemia (Demand Ischaemia / Type 2 MI)

**Pathophysiology**: Any sustained tachycardia ↑myocardial O₂ demand (↑HR → ↑contractility → ↑wall stress) while simultaneously ↓O₂ supply (↓diastolic time → ↓coronary perfusion time). If the patient has underlying coronary stenoses, this mismatch crosses a critical threshold → ischaemia.

> ***Evolving phase of MI: associated arrhythmia because infarcted muscles are acidotic → K⁺ influx + Ca²⁺ efflux*** [17] — this creates a vicious cycle where ischaemia begets arrhythmia begets more ischaemia.

| Scenario | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| SVT or AF with fast rate in patient with CAD | Demand ischaemia → angina, ST changes, troponin rise (Type 2 MI) |
| VT in post-MI patient | VT ↓CO → ↓coronary perfusion → worsens ischaemia → VT becomes more refractory |
| Severe anaemia + tachycardia | Double hit: ↓O₂ carrying capacity + ↑demand → ischaemia even without CAD |

---

### 6. Complications Specific to Underlying Conditions Causing Palpitations

#### A. Phaeochromocytoma Complications

> ***Phaeochromocytoma crisis: APO, ICH*** [10]

> ***Symptoms of HTN complications: LV failure, MI and cardiomyopathy; Stroke or hypertensive retinopathy*** [9]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Hypertensive crisis** (including APO, ICH) | Massive catecholamine surge → extreme vasoconstriction → ↑↑afterload → flash pulmonary oedema; ↑↑BP → rupture of cerebral vessels → intracerebral haemorrhage |
| **Catecholamine cardiomyopathy** | Chronic catecholamine excess → direct myocardial toxicity (contraction band necrosis) → DCMP; mimics Takotsubo |
| **Arrhythmias** | Catecholamines ↑automaticity and triggered activity → sinus tachycardia, SVT, VT, VF |
| **MI** | Coronary vasospasm from α₁-stimulation + demand ischaemia from ↑HR/↑BP |

#### B. Thyrotoxicosis Complications [3]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **AF** (10-25% of thyrotoxic patients) | T3/T4 ↑β₁-receptor density + ↓atrial refractory period → facilitates AF |
| **High-output heart failure** | ↑CO + ↓SVR → volume overload → eventually LV decompensation |
| **Angina / MI** | ↑Myocardial O₂ demand (↑HR, ↑contractility) exceeds supply, especially with coexistent CAD |
| **Thyroid storm** | Life-threatening: fever, confusion, tachycardia, multi-organ failure; can cause fatal arrhythmia |
| **Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis** | ↑Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase → severe hypoK → arrhythmia risk + flaccid paralysis |

#### C. Electrolyte-Related Complications [3][21]

***Hypokalaemia*** and ***hypomagnesaemia*** [3] are not just causes of palpitations — they are directly pro-arrhythmic:

| Level | ECG Changes | Arrhythmia Risk |
|---|---|---|
| K⁺ 3.0-3.5 mmol/L | ST depression, T-wave flattening, U waves | ↑Ectopics |
| K⁺ 2.5-3.0 mmol/L | Prominent U waves, T-U fusion | VT, AF |
| K⁺ < 2.5 mmol/L | Severe QT prolongation | VF, TdP, cardiac arrest |
| ***HyperK 6-7 mmol/L*** | ***Tall, peaked T waves*** [21] | |
| ***HyperK 8-10 mmol/L*** | ***Aberrant QRS complexes*** [21] | |
| ***HyperK 10-12 mmol/L*** | ***Ventricular fibrillation*** [21] | Cardiac arrest |

---

### 7. Psychological and Quality-of-Life Complications

These are often underappreciated but clinically significant:

| Complication | Mechanism | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Anxiety and health anxiety** | Recurrent unpredictable palpitations → fear of cardiac death → catastrophic thinking | Avoidance behaviour, frequent A&E presentations, high healthcare utilisation |
| **Agoraphobia** | Panic attacks with palpitations → fear of attacks occurring in public → avoidance of open/public spaces | Social isolation, functional impairment |
| ***Depression*** [3] | Chronic anxiety + functional limitation from arrhythmia + medication side effects | 37% of panic disorder patients have lifetime major depression [6]; chronic AF patients have significantly ↑depression rates |
| **Reduced quality of life** | Symptoms (palpitations, syncope, fatigue) + medication side effects + lifestyle restrictions (exercise avoidance in LQTS/HCMP) | Impaired work capacity, social functioning, physical activity |
| **Cardiac neurosis** | ***Quite likely. Consider cardiac neurosis, anxiety*** [3] — once established, repeated reassurance often fails | Doctor-shopping, repeated investigations, iatrogenic harm from unnecessary procedures |
| **Medication side effects** | Amiodarone toxicity (thyroid, pulmonary fibrosis, hepatotoxicity, corneal deposits, photosensitivity); β-blocker fatigue/sexual dysfunction; anticoagulant bleeding | Can be as disabling as the arrhythmia itself |

> ***Course of panic disorder: tends to be recurrent and chronic with fluctuating anxiety and depression. Impact: ↓QoL, functioning and ↑all-cause mortality (esp cardiovascular disorders)*** [33]

<Callout title="The Bidirectional Relationship Between Palpitations and Anxiety">
Palpitations cause anxiety (fear of heart disease) and anxiety causes palpitations (sympathetic activation). This bidirectional loop can be extremely difficult to break and is the basis of panic disorder. Breaking it requires both medical reassurance (normal investigations) AND psychological intervention (CBT targeting catastrophic cognitions about bodily sensations).

### 8. Treatment-Related Complications

The treatments for arrhythmias carry their own risks:

| Treatment | Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Anticoagulation (DOACs/warfarin)** | Haemorrhage (GI, intracranial, other) | Impaired haemostasis |
| **Amiodarone** | Thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism; pulmonary fibrosis; hepatotoxicity; corneal microdeposits; peripheral neuropathy; photosensitivity (blue-grey skin) | Amiodarone is 37% iodine by weight → affects thyroid; accumulates in lipophilic tissues (lung, liver, cornea, skin) |
| **Catheter ablation** | Cardiac tamponade (perforation); pulmonary vein stenosis (after PVI); AV block (AVNRT ablation near AV node); stroke; phrenic nerve injury; oesophageal fistula (left atrial ablation) | Mechanical/thermal injury to adjacent structures |
| **ICD** | Inappropriate shocks (sinus tachycardia or AF misread as VT); lead fracture/infection; psychological impact of shocks; device-related endocarditis | Device algorithm errors; mechanical lead failure; foreign body infection |
| **Pacemaker** | Lead displacement; infection; pneumothorax (during insertion); pacemaker syndrome (AV dyssynchrony with VVI pacing); battery depletion | Procedural complications + long-term device limitations |
| **Cardioversion** | Thromboembolism (if inadequate pre-anticoagulation); skin burns; arrhythmia (VF if unsynchronised on T wave); transient myocardial stunning | Dislodgement of pre-existing LA thrombus; electrical injury |
| **Antiarrhythmic drugs** | ***Proarrhythmia*** — the greatest irony in arrhythmia management: drugs given to treat arrhythmias can cause new or worse arrhythmias | Class IC drugs (flecainide, propafenone) → ↑mortality in post-MI patients (CAST trial); Class III drugs → QT prolongation → TdP; digoxin toxicity → virtually any arrhythmia |

<Callout title="The Proarrhythmic Paradox" type="error">
The CAST trial (1989) was a landmark study that showed flecainide and encainide (Class IC antiarrhythmics), given to suppress VPBs after MI, actually *increased* mortality by causing fatal VT/VF. This is why Class IC drugs are **contraindicated in structural heart disease**. It fundamentally changed how we prescribe antiarrhythmics — the principle is: *never give flecainide or propafenone to anyone with structural heart disease or ischaemic heart disease*.

### Summary Table: Complications by System

| System | Complication | Most Commonly From | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cardiac — arrest** | SCD from VF | VT, WPW+AF, TdP, LQTS, Brugada, HCMP | Degrades to VF → no output |
| **Cardiac — failure** | Tachycardiomyopathy | Any sustained tachycardia, high-burden VPBs | Chronic ↑HR → energy depletion → LV dilatation |
| **Cardiac — ischaemia** | Type 2 MI | Sustained tachycardia + underlying CAD | Supply-demand mismatch |
| **Cerebrovascular** | Stroke | AF, AFL | LA stasis → thrombus → embolism |
| **Systemic embolic** | Renal/mesenteric/limb ischaemia | AF | Same as stroke but to other territories |
| **Neurological** | Syncope, presyncope | VT, CHB, SSS, HCMP, TdP | ↓CO → ↓cerebral perfusion |
| **Endocrine complications** | Hypertensive crisis, catecholamine CMP | Phaeochromocytoma | Catecholamine surge |
| **Psychological** | Anxiety, depression, agoraphobia | Recurrent palpitations of any cause | Fear + avoidance cycle |
| **Iatrogenic** | Proarrhythmia, bleeding, device Cx | Treatment of arrhythmias | Drug/device-specific |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Sudden cardiac death** is the most feared complication — from VT/VF in structural HD, WPW+AF, TdP (LQTS/drugs/electrolytes), HCMP, Brugada. Prevention: ICD in high-risk patients.

2. **Stroke** from AF — 5-fold increased risk. Thrombus forms in LAA due to stasis. Prevention: anticoagulation guided by CHA₂DS₂-VASc score.

3. **Tachycardiomyopathy** — any sustained tachycardia (including "benign" VPBs at > 10% burden) can cause a reversible dilated cardiomyopathy. Identifying and treating the arrhythmia can normalise LVEF.

4. **Syncope** during palpitations = red flag → implies haemodynamically significant arrhythmia. Always warrants urgent evaluation.

5. **Type 2 MI** — tachycardia → supply-demand mismatch → troponin rise, especially in patients with underlying CAD. This is not ACS but still dangerous.

6. **Phaeochromocytoma crisis** (APO, ICH) and **thyroid storm** are life-threatening complications of endocrine causes of palpitations.

7. **Electrolyte complications**: HyperK follows a predictable ECG progression (peaked T → wide QRS → sine wave → VF). HypoK → prolonged QT → TdP.

8. **Proarrhythmia** — antiarrhythmic drugs can paradoxically worsen arrhythmias. Class IC drugs (flecainide) are contraindicated in structural heart disease (CAST trial).

9. **Psychological complications** — recurrent palpitations cause anxiety, panic disorder, agoraphobia, depression, and cardiac neurosis. The palpitation-anxiety loop is bidirectional and requires both medical and psychological intervention.

10. **Treatment complications** — amiodarone (thyroid/lung/liver/cornea), ablation (tamponade, PV stenosis), ICD (inappropriate shocks, infection), anticoagulation (bleeding).
