## Complications of Conditions Presenting with Dysuria and Urinary Frequency

The complications discussed here are organised by the underlying condition. Each complication is explained from first principles — **why** it occurs, based on the pathophysiology already covered.

---

### A. Complications of UTI

UTI, if left untreated or inadequately treated, can progress along a spectrum of increasing severity. Think of it as bacteria ascending through the urinary tract and eventually entering the bloodstream.

#### 1. Ascending Infection: Cystitis → Pyelonephritis → Pyonephrosis

**Progression pathway**: Bacteria that initially colonise the bladder (cystitis) can ascend via the ureters to the renal pelvis and parenchyma → **acute pyelonephritis**. If the infected kidney is simultaneously obstructed (e.g. by a stone at the PUJ or ureter), pus accumulates under pressure in the collecting system → **pyonephrosis** (literally "pus in the kidney" — from Greek "pyo" = pus, "nephros" = kidney).

- **Why this matters**: Pyonephrosis is a urological emergency. Pus under pressure in a closed obstructed system → rapid parenchymal destruction + bacteraemia → urosepsis. Requires **urgent drainage** (percutaneous nephrostomy or JJ stent) plus IV antibiotics [3][4].
- **Clinical clue**: A patient with UTI symptoms who develops high spiking fevers, rigors, loin pain, and renal angle tenderness despite appropriate oral antibiotics → suspect ascending infection or obstruction.

#### 2. Urosepsis

**Urosepsis** = sepsis arising from a urinary tract source. It is the most feared complication of UTI and carries significant mortality (25–60% in septic shock).

- **Mechanism**: Bacterial invasion of the bloodstream from the infected urinary tract (bacteraemia) → systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) → if uncontrolled → sepsis → severe sepsis → septic shock. Gram-negative organisms (especially E. coli) release endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) → activates TLR4 on macrophages → massive cytokine storm (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) → vasodilation, capillary leak, DIC, multi-organ failure.
- **Risk factors**: obstructed infected urinary tract (pyonephrosis), immunosuppression, diabetes, indwelling catheter, urological instrumentation
- **Red flags**: fever > 39°C, rigors, tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, oliguria

#### 3. Renal Abscess / Perinephric Abscess

- **Mechanism**: Severe pyelonephritis → focal areas of suppuration coalesce → renal abscess. If the abscess ruptures through the renal capsule → perinephric abscess (contained by Gerota's fascia).
- **Clinical features**: failure to defervesce despite appropriate antibiotics for pyelonephritis, persistent loin pain, palpable mass
- **Diagnosis**: CT with contrast (rim-enhancing fluid collection)
- **Management**: drainage (percutaneous or surgical) + prolonged antibiotics

#### 4. Chronic Pyelonephritis and Renal Scarring

- **Mechanism**: recurrent or prolonged UTI (especially with VUR in children) → chronic tubulointerstitial inflammation → fibrosis and cortical scarring → ↓nephron number → compensatory hyperfiltration in remaining nephrons → secondary FSGS → proteinuria, hypertension, progressive CKD [4]
- **Clinical relevance**: This is why VUR with recurrent UTI in children must be identified and managed early — to prevent irreversible renal damage.

#### 5. Recurrent UTI

- ***20% of women with UTI will recur within 6 months*** [4]
- > 95% due to **re-infection** (different organism each time) — genetically determined susceptibility [4]
- Minority due to **bacterial persistence** from a focus within the urinary tract (same organism) — potentially correctable [4]

#### 6. Struvite (Infection) Stone Formation

- **Mechanism**: Urease-producing organisms (classically **Proteus mirabilis**, also Klebsiella, S. aureus) split urea → ammonia + CO₂ → ↑urine pH (alkalinisation) → supersaturation with magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) → stone formation [5]
- **Clinical significance**: struvite stones can grow rapidly to fill the entire renal collecting system → **staghorn calculus** → chronic infection, obstruction, renal parenchymal destruction
- **Tip**: repeated isolation of Proteus species in urine cultures should prompt investigation for renal stones

---

### B. Complications of BPH

The complications of BPH arise from chronic bladder outlet obstruction. Think of the pathology in a **proximal-to-distal** sequence — prostate level → bladder level → upper tract [5]:

#### At the Prostate Level

- ***Bleeding (ruptured dilated bladder neck veins)*** [5]: chronic obstruction → venous congestion of the prostatic urethra and bladder neck → dilated submucosal veins → rupture → haematuria. **Note**: ***the presence of BPH should not dissuade from further evaluation of haematuria since older men are also at risk of other genitourinary disorders*** (especially bladder cancer and prostate cancer) [3]

#### At the Bladder Level [5]

- ***Acute retention of urine (AROU)***: progressive obstruction eventually overwhelms the detrusor's ability to compensate → sudden inability to void. Often precipitated by constipation, UTI, anaesthesia, alcohol, or drugs (anticholinergics, sympathomimetics) [5]
- ***Recurrent UTI***: urinary stasis from incomplete emptying → bacterial colonisation and multiplication → recurrent infections [5]
- ***Bladder stones***: stagnant residual urine → supersaturation and crystallisation → stone formation in the bladder [5]
- **Bladder diverticulum**: chronic high-pressure voiding against the obstruction → ↑intravesical pressure → herniation of bladder mucosa through weak points in the detrusor muscle → diverticula (sac-like outpouchings that don't empty well → further stasis, infection, stone formation)
- **Chronic retention of urine ± overflow incontinence**: progressive detrusor decompensation → large post-void residual → continuous low-grade overflow [5]
- **Detrusor changes**: initially, the detrusor **hypertrophies** (thickened wall on USG) to generate higher pressures to overcome obstruction. Over time, if obstruction persists, detrusor fibres are replaced by collagen → detrusor **decompensation** (thin, atonic wall) → inability to contract effectively

#### At the Upper Tract Level [5]

- ***Recurrent hydronephrosis***: back-pressure from chronically elevated intravesical pressure transmits retrograde through the ureters → bilateral hydroureter and hydronephrosis [5]
- ***Obstructive uropathy / Obstructive nephropathy***: prolonged back-pressure → progressive renal parenchymal damage → ↓GFR → renal impairment [5]
- ***Renal failure***: end-stage consequence of bilateral obstructive uropathy; may present insidiously with uraemic symptoms (vomiting, lethargy, drowsiness) — ***usually rare in AROU, more likely in CROU*** [2]

<Callout title="Why Chronic Retention Is More Dangerous Than Acute">
In AROU, the patient presents early (pain forces them to seek help) and the obstruction is quickly relieved by catheterisation. In **chronic** retention, the onset is insidious and painless (because nerve adaptation occurs with gradual distension). By the time the patient presents, there may already be significant bilateral hydronephrosis and renal impairment. Always check RFT in any patient with urinary retention.
</Callout>

### C. Complications of AROU and Its Decompression

#### Complications of AROU Itself [2]

- **UTI**: stagnant urine in a distended bladder is an excellent culture medium
- **Stone disease**: stasis → crystallisation
- **Renal failure**: back-pressure if bilateral obstruction (more likely in CROU)

#### Complications of Bladder Decompression [3]

After catheterisation for retention, several complications can occur:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Haematuria*** | Rapid decompression → ↓intravesical pressure → sudden expansion of previously compressed bladder veins → bleeding (ex vacuo haemorrhage) | Usually self-limiting; if significant, bladder irrigation via 3-way catheter |
| ***Urethral stricture*** | Mechanical trauma from catheter passage → urethral mucosal injury → fibrosis → stricture (especially with repeated catheterisation) | Prevention: proper technique, appropriate catheter size, adequate lubrication |
| ***Urinary tract infections*** | Catheter introduces bacteria directly into the bladder; biofilm formation on catheter surface → CAUTI | Minimise catheter dwell time; aseptic technique |
| ***Transient hypotension*** | Rapid drainage of large volume → sudden ↓intra-abdominal pressure → ↓venous return → vasovagal response + redistribution of blood volume | Gradual drainage (although evidence for clamping is debated); monitor vitals |
| ***Post-obstructive diuresis*** | ***Diuresis that persists after decompression of the bladder. Represents an appropriate attempt to excrete excess fluid and solutes retained during obstruction*** [3] | |
| | ***Primarily a problem of chronic but not acute retention*** [3] — in CROU, days-to-weeks of obstruction leads to accumulation of urea, sodium, and water; once relieved, the kidneys "dump" the excess | ***Do NOT remove Foley catheter during diuresis*** [3] |
| | ***Defined as diuresis > 200 mL/hr for 2 hours*** [3] | ***Patients normally manage by ↑oral fluid intake; isotonic saline replacement if unable to keep up orally*** [3] |
| | Can also involve a concentrating defect (medullary washout from chronic high-pressure back-flow) → dilute polyuria | Monitor serum electrolytes (risk of hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia) |

---

### D. Complications of Catheterisation [3]

Urinary catheterisation itself — as part of managing these conditions — carries its own set of complications:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI)** | Biofilm formation on catheter surface provides a niche for bacterial colonisation; risk ↑3–7% per day of catheterisation; commonest healthcare-associated infection |
| **Epididymo-orchitis** | Bacteria ascend from catheterised bladder via vas deferens → epididymal infection → orchitis |
| **Bladder perforation** | Traumatic insertion; over-inflation of balloon before it is fully within the bladder |
| **Bladder fistula** | Chronic catheter erosion through bladder wall (rare, usually with long-term indwelling catheter) |
| **Bladder stone formation** | Foreign body (catheter) acts as nidus for crystallisation; also catheter-related stasis |
| **Urethral stricture** | Repeated catheterisation → mucosal trauma → fibrosis → stricture |
| **Periurethral abscess** | Infection tracking along catheter → periurethral soft tissue infection |
| **Incontinence** | Chronic catheterisation → sphincter weakening; mucosal erosion |

### E. Complications of TURP [4][5]

These are high-yield for exams — you must be able to discuss them during consent-taking.

#### Early Complications (significant complications in ~15–20%, mortality 0.2–2.5%) [4]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding*** | Trauma to prostatic vasculature during resection | ***3–7% require transfusion*** [4]; post-op haematuria is expected but usually settles with bladder irrigation |
| **Infection and urosepsis** | Breach of infected prostatic tissue; bacteraemia during instrumentation | Antibiotic prophylaxis essential |
| ***TUR syndrome (post-prostatectomy syndrome)*** | ***Irrigation fluid (1.5% glycine) low in sodium enters venous channels → dilutional hyponatraemia + ↓osmolarity*** [4]; aggravated by post-op stress-related ADH release | ***S/S: N/V, confusion, hypertension, visual disturbance (flashing lights), giddiness, seizures*** [4] |
| | ***Lowest Na at 1–2h post-op, slowly ↑ afterwards due to glycine uptake into cells*** [4] | ***Prevention: bipolar technique (use ionic saline), limit OT < 1h, irrigation pressure < 60 mmHg, monitor glycine deficit*** [4][5] |
| | | ***Mx: stop OT immediately + Na replacement + furosemide*** [4] |
| ***Retrograde ejaculation*** | ***Incompetent bladder neck after resection → retrograde flow of semen into bladder during ejaculation*** [4] | ***40–60%*** [4] (some sources quote 70–80% [5]); ***penile erection and sexual function rarely affected*** [4]; must counsel regarding fertility impact |
| ***Incontinence*** | Damage to external sphincter during resection | ***1%*** [4]; urge incontinence early (temporary detrusor irritability from healing), stress incontinence late (permanent sphincter damage) |
| **Strictures / bladder neck stenosis** | Urethral instrumentation (resectoscope) → mucosal trauma → fibrosis | |
| **Perforation** | Resection too deep → perforation of prostatic capsule or bladder dome → ***can form fistula*** [5] | |

#### Late Complications [4]

| Complication | Incidence |
|---|---|
| ***Bladder neck stenosis and urethral strictures*** | ***7–8%*** [4] |
| ***Urinary incontinence*** | ***2%*** [4] |
| **Regrowth of prostate** | ***5% need re-operation in 5 years*** [4] — because TURP only resects the adenoma, not the entire prostate; remaining tissue can regrow |
| ***Ejaculatory dysfunction (retrograde ejaculation)*** | ***40–60%*** [4] |
| ***Erectile dysfunction*** | ***5% — uncommon*** [4] |

### F. Complications of Gonorrhoea (STD Causing Dysuria) [4]

| Male | Female | Children |
|---|---|---|
| **Periurethral abscess** | **Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)** | **Vulvovaginitis** |
| **Urethral stricture**, infertility | **Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome** (perihepatitis) | **Ophthalmia neonatorum** |
| **Prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis** | Peritonitis | Dissemination |
| **Epididymo-orchitis** | **Bartholinitis** | |
| **Cystitis** | **Infertility** | |
| Inflammation/abscess of bulbourethral, parafrenal, paraurethral glands | Obstetric Cx: ectopic pregnancy, prematurity, PROM, chorioamnionitis, post-abortal PID | |

**Disseminated gonococcal infection** (0.5–3%): classic triad of **tenosynovitis, dermatitis, polyarthralgia** or **purulent monoarthritis** [4].

<Callout title="Why Gonorrhoea Causes Urethral Stricture">
N. gonorrhoeae triggers intense neutrophilic inflammation in the urethral mucosa. If untreated or recurrent, this inflammation leads to submucosal fibrosis and scar formation → progressive narrowing of the urethral lumen → urethral stricture. This is why early and complete treatment of gonococcal urethritis is essential, and why a history of STDs (especially GC) must be asked in any patient presenting with obstructive LUTS or urethral stricture.

### G. Complications of Urinary Stones (When Presenting with Dysuria/Frequency) [3][5]

Stones at the VUJ or in the bladder cause dysuria and frequency by irritating the trigone. Their complications include:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Urosepsis*** | Obstruction + infection = emergency; pus under pressure |
| ***Pyelonephritis and pyonephrosis*** | Ascending infection above an obstructing stone |
| ***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis*** | Back-pressure from obstruction; also from scarring around stone / post-obstructive effect [5] |
| ***Obstructive nephropathy*** | Prolonged obstruction → renal parenchymal damage |
| ***Acute kidney injury*** | Bilateral obstruction or obstruction of a solitary kidney → post-renal AKI |

---

### H. Complications of Bladder Cancer (When Presenting with Dysuria/Frequency) [4]

Bladder cancer, especially carcinoma in situ (CIS), can present with irritative LUTS (frequency, urgency, dysuria) rather than painless haematuria:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Hydronephrosis and hydroureter** | ***Invasive bladder tumours can cause distal ureteral obstruction → secondary hydronephrosis*** [3] |
| ***Vesicocolic fistula → pneumaturia*** | Tumour extends into adjacent colon [4] |
| ***Vesicovaginal fistula → incontinence*** | Tumour extends into vagina [4] |
| **Systemic metastasis** (liver, bone, brain) | Haematogenous and lymphatic spread of muscle-invasive disease [4] |

---

### I. Complications of Genitourinary TB [4]

GU TB causes dysuria and frequency from bladder involvement (**TB cystitis**). Complications are primarily **cicatricial** (scarring-related):

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Ureteric strictures** (60–84%) | Chronic granulomatous inflammation → fibrosis and scarring of ureteric wall → segmental strictures and dilatation ("corkscrew ureter"), shortened rigid ureter ("pipe-stem ureter") [4] |
| **Contracted "thimble" bladder** | Chronic TB cystitis → fibrosis and contracture → markedly reduced bladder capacity (may be < 50 mL) → extreme frequency [4] |
| **"Golf-hole" ureteral orifice** | Patulous (gaping) ureteral orifice from peri-orifice fibrosis → VUR → ascending infection and upper tract damage [4] |
| **Autonephrectomy** | Caseous necrosis + calcification → non-functioning calcified kidney [4] |
| **Infertility** | Male: obstructive azoospermia from epididymal/vas deferens involvement. Female: fallopian tube involvement (90–100%) |
