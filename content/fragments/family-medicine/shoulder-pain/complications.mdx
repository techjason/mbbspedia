## Complications of Shoulder Pain Conditions

Complications can arise from the underlying pathology itself (disease complications), from the treatment we deliver (iatrogenic/treatment complications), or from the prolonged immobility and disability that shoulder conditions cause. Understanding *why* each complication occurs — from first principles — is essential for both prevention and early recognition.

---

### A. Complications of Disease (Untreated or Progressive Pathology)

#### 1. SAIS → Rotator Cuff Degeneration and Tear

***Complications*** of SAIS [3]:
- ***Rotator cuff degeneration and tear***
- ***Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder)***

**Why does SAIS progress to rotator cuff tear?** Chronic mechanical impingement of the supraspinatus tendon against the acromion causes repetitive microtrauma → collagen fibre disorganisation → tendinosis (failed healing response with mucoid degeneration and neovascularisation) → progressive weakening → partial tear → full-thickness tear. This is essentially Neer's Stage I → II → III progression. The tendon's poor vascularity at the watershed zone means it cannot repair itself adequately under ongoing mechanical stress.

**Why does SAIS lead to frozen shoulder?** Pain from impingement causes guarding and reduced shoulder use → disuse leads to capsular inflammation and fibrosis → secondary adhesive capsulitis. This is why early physiotherapy (within the pain-free range) is important even in SAIS — to prevent the secondary complication of capsular contracture.

#### 2. Rotator Cuff Tear → Progressive Arthropathy

***Complication*** of rotator cuff tear [3]: ***adhesive capsulitis***, ***recurrence***

**Cuff tear arthropathy**: When a massive rotator cuff tear goes untreated, the humeral head is no longer held centred in the glenoid. The unopposed pull of the deltoid drives the humeral head superiorly → chronic articulation between the humeral head and the acromion (instead of the glenoid) → "acetabularisation" of the acromion and "femoralization" of the humeral head → secondary glenohumeral OA. This end-stage condition is called **cuff tear arthropathy** and is the primary indication for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [3].

**Why adhesive capsulitis?** Same mechanism as with SAIS — pain leads to disuse, disuse leads to capsular fibrosis. Additionally, any shoulder surgery for rotator cuff repair inherently risks adhesive capsulitis from post-operative immobilisation (the very sling that protects the repair also immobilises the capsule).

**Recurrence of tear after surgical repair**: Re-tear rates after rotator cuff repair are significant — ranging from 20% for small tears to > 70% for massive tears. Why? The repaired tendon must heal back to bone (tendon-to-bone healing), which is biologically challenging because the normal enthesis (the gradual transition zone from tendon → fibrocartilage → mineralised cartilage → bone) is never fully regenerated. Instead, a weaker fibrovascular scar forms at the repair site.

#### 3. Frozen Shoulder → Chronic Stiffness and Functional Loss

***Thawing phase: 5–24 months — may not completely resolve spontaneously*** [3]

While frozen shoulder is often described as "self-limiting," the reality is more nuanced:
- Up to **40% of patients** have persistent restriction of motion (usually ER and IR) at long-term follow-up
- Diabetic patients have a **worse prognosis** — more severe stiffness, longer disease duration, and higher rates of residual restriction. This is because ongoing collagen glycosylation continues to drive capsular fibrosis even during the "thawing" phase.
- **Muscle atrophy**: Prolonged disuse leads to wasting of deltoid, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus. Even after ROM returns, the patient may have weakness from deconditioning that requires months of rehabilitation.

#### 4. Shoulder Dislocation → Recurrence and Structural Damage

Complications of shoulder dislocation [15]:
- ***Recurrence*** — the Bankart lesion (avulsion of anterior-inferior labrum) creates a permanent defect in the static stabilising ring. Recurrence rate after first-time anterior dislocation: ~50–90% in patients < 20 years old, ~10–25% in patients > 40. Why such an age difference? Younger patients have more elastic capsules and ligaments, so the labral detachment does not scar down as firmly. They also tend to be more active and expose the shoulder to further risk.
- ***Chronic pain / stiffness*** — from capsulolabral scarring and inflammation
- ***Adhesive capsulitis*** — especially if prolonged immobilisation after reduction
- ***Rotator cuff injury*** — in patients > 40 with dislocation, the rotator cuff (especially supraspinatus) often tears at the time of dislocation because the ageing tendon is weaker than the capsulolabral complex [15]
- ***Nerve damage (especially axillary & suprascapular nerve)*** [15] — the axillary nerve wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus and is stretched during inferior displacement of the humeral head. Axillary nerve injury occurs in ~5–35% of anterior dislocations (higher in older patients). Results in: deltoid weakness + loss of sensation over the "regimental badge area" (lateral deltoid). Suprascapular nerve injury causes supraspinatus and infraspinatus weakness.
- ***Degenerative joint disease, e.g. secondary OA*** [15] — from damage to the articular cartilage at the time of dislocation (Hill-Sachs lesion = impression fracture of posterior humeral head; glenoid rim fractures) → altered joint mechanics → accelerated wear

#### 5. Septic Arthritis → Joint Destruction

If not treated urgently:
- **Cartilage destruction**: Bacterial proteases and inflammatory enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases, collagenases) released by activated neutrophils destroy the articular cartilage within **48–72 hours**. Cartilage has no intrinsic blood supply and cannot regenerate — the destruction is irreversible.
- **Osteomyelitis**: Infection can spread from the joint into the adjacent bone
- **Systemic sepsis**: Bacteraemia from the infected joint → septic shock, multi-organ failure
- **Secondary OA**: Even after successful treatment, the damaged cartilage surface leads to premature OA
- **Ankylosis**: In severe cases, complete joint destruction leads to fibrous or bony fusion

#### 6. Cervical Radiculopathy → Myelopathy

If cervical spondylosis progresses from foraminal stenosis (radiculopathy) to central canal stenosis (myelopathy), the consequences are far more severe [8]:
- **Arms**: LMN signs at the level of compression + sensory loss
- **Legs**: UMN signs (spasticity, hyperreflexia, Babinski positive) + ***spastic scissoring gait***
- **Sphincter**: Late feature — bladder dysfunction
- **Key point**: Unlike radiculopathy, which can often be managed conservatively, ***myelopathy usually does not improve spontaneously and typically progresses*** → earlier surgical decompression is warranted [8]

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### 1. Complications of Corticosteroid Injections

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| **Tendon weakening / rupture** | Corticosteroids inhibit collagen synthesis and promote collagenase activity → weakened tendon structure. Risk increases with repeated injections ( > 3 per year) | Limit to 3 injections per site per year; never inject directly INTO a tendon (peritendinous only) |
| **Post-injection flare** (2–10%) | Crystal-induced synovitis from the crystalline steroid suspension (e.g., methylprednisolone acetate) | Self-limiting (24–48h); warn patient in advance; ice application |
| **Skin atrophy / depigmentation** | Corticosteroids inhibit fibroblast proliferation and melanocyte function in overlying skin | Use deep injection technique; avoid superficial subcutaneous deposition |
| **Transient hyperglycaemia** | Corticosteroid → hepatic gluconeogenesis ↑, peripheral insulin resistance ↑ | Warn diabetic patients to monitor glucose closely for 48h post-injection; adjust insulin if needed |
| **Infection** (rare, ~1 in 10,000–50,000) | Introduction of skin organisms during injection | Strict aseptic technique; C/I if overlying skin infection |

#### 2. Complications of Surgical Management

##### Frozen Shoulder Surgery

***MUA complications*** [3]:
- ***Fracture (esp. during ER)*** [3] — this is the most feared complication. The osteoporotic humeral shaft or neck can fracture when the surgeon forcefully externally rotates the arm against the contracted capsule. Why ER specifically? Because the inferior glenohumeral ligament/axillary recess (the most fibrotic and contracted structure) directly resists ER → maximum force is transmitted through the humerus during this manoeuvre. Risk factors: osteoporosis, elderly, chronic steroid use.
- **Brachial plexus traction injury** — from excessive force during manipulation
- **Labral tear / capsular avulsion** — intended effect (capsular rupture) but may be uncontrolled
- **Haemarthrosis** — bleeding from ruptured capsular vessels

***Arthroscopic capsular release complications*** [3]:
- ***Residual stiffness (early mobilisation)*** [3] — the most common issue. If the patient does not begin aggressive physiotherapy within 24–48 hours of surgery, the released capsule will re-scar → stiffness recurs. This is why the surgeon and physiotherapist must coordinate closely, and patient compliance with post-operative PT is absolutely critical.
- ***Axillary nerve injury*** [3] — the axillary nerve lies just 2–3mm from the inferior capsule at the 6 o'clock position of the glenoid. The inferior capsule is precisely the area that most needs release (it is the most contracted portion in frozen shoulder). Surgeons must stay above the 5:30 position to avoid the nerve. If injured: deltoid paralysis + teres minor weakness + sensory loss over the regimental badge area.

##### Rotator Cuff Repair

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Re-tear** (most common, 20–70%) | Poor tendon-to-bone healing biology; tendon quality often poor at time of repair due to chronic degeneration; excessive early loading before biological healing is complete |
| ***Adhesive capsulitis*** [3] | Post-operative immobilisation in sling (typically 6 weeks) → capsular inflammation → fibrosis. The very protection the repair needs conflicts with the mobility the capsule needs. Managed with early controlled passive ROM within safe parameters. |
| **Infection** (rare, ~1%) | Surgical site infection; higher risk with open procedures than arthroscopic |
| **Nerve injury** (rare) | Musculocutaneous nerve (portal placement), axillary nerve (inferior dissection), suprascapular nerve |
| **Stiffness** | Over-aggressive repair (too much tension) → restricted ROM |
| **Anchor pull-out** | Suture anchors fail to hold in osteoporotic bone → repair fails |

##### Subacromial Decompression

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Deltoid detachment** | The acromioplasty may inadvertently damage the deltoid origin from the acromion → deltoid weakness. More common with open approach. Arthroscopic approach largely avoids this. |
| **Inadequate decompression** | Insufficient bone removed → persistent impingement → ongoing symptoms |
| **Over-resection** | Too much acromion removed → loss of the coracoacromial arch → superior escape of the humeral head (especially in the setting of a subsequent cuff tear) |
| **Infection, stiffness** | As with any shoulder surgery |

##### Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (rTSA)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Instability / dislocation** | Altered biomechanics; inadequate soft tissue tension; polyethylene wear |
| **Scapular notching** | Impingement of the humeral cup on the inferior glenoid rim during adduction → bone erosion at the scapular neck. The medialised centre of rotation brings the humerus very close to the scapula. |
| **Infection** | As with any prosthetic joint surgery; devastating if occurs (may require explantation) |
| **Acromial stress fracture** | The deltoid is the sole abductor in rTSA → increased stress on the acromion (deltoid origin) → stress fracture |
| **Aseptic loosening** | As with any arthroplasty; periarticular foreign-body reaction → osteolysis at the bone-prosthesis interface [14] |
| **Nerve injury** (axillary, brachial plexus) | Traction during surgery, especially with arm lengthening |

#### 3. Complications of Prolonged Immobilisation / Disability

Shoulder pain from any cause that leads to prolonged immobilisation or disability can result in systemic complications. This is particularly relevant in the context of **post-stroke shoulder** [16]:

***Prolonged immobilisation*** [16]: ***pressure sores, contractures, frozen shoulder, shoulder subluxation***

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| ***Frozen shoulder*** (secondary) [16] | Immobility → capsular inflammation → fibrosis. Common after stroke, shoulder surgery, or any condition causing prolonged arm disuse. | Early gentle passive ROM even while primary condition is being treated |
| ***Shoulder subluxation*** [16] | In hemiplegic patients, loss of rotator cuff and deltoid tone → the weight of the flaccid arm pulls the humeral head inferiorly → visible/palpable gap below the acromion | Arm support (sling, armrest), shoulder strapping, early physiotherapy |
| ***Contractures*** [16] | Prolonged position of immobility → muscle and tendon shortening → fixed deformity | Frequent repositioning, passive ROM exercises |
| **Muscle atrophy** | Disuse → type II muscle fibre loss → weakness and wasting | Early mobilisation, resistance exercises when permitted |
| **Complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I)** | Aberrant neuroinflammatory response to injury or immobilisation → chronic pain, swelling, sudomotor and vasomotor changes in the affected limb. Exact mechanism debated but involves peripheral and central sensitisation. Previously called "reflex sympathetic dystrophy." | Early mobilisation; avoid prolonged strict immobilisation; physiotherapy |
| ***Restricted shoulder mobility*** [17] | Post-axillary lymph node dissection (breast surgery) → scarring, lymphoedema, nerve injury → shoulder dysfunction | Early shoulder rehabilitation programme; physiotherapy |

<Callout title="Post-Stroke Shoulder — A Common Scenario" type="idea">
Shoulder pain occurs in up to **70% of stroke patients** with hemiplegia. Causes include shoulder subluxation (flaccid stage), spasticity-related impingement (spastic stage), adhesive capsulitis, CRPS-I, and brachial plexus traction. Prevention strategies include ***early physiotherapy***, proper positioning, sling support, and gentle passive ROM from day 1 of stroke admission [16].

### C. Nerve Injury Complications (Specific to Shoulder Region)

Nerve injuries deserve special attention because they are commonly tested and have predictable clinical consequences:

| Nerve | At Risk During | Clinical Consequence | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Axillary nerve (C5,6)** | Shoulder dislocation, proximal humerus fracture, arthroscopic capsular release [3][15] | Deltoid weakness (cannot abduct past 15°), teres minor weakness, sensory loss over "regimental badge area" | Nerve wraps tightly around the surgical neck of the humerus and passes through the quadrilateral space; vulnerable to stretch in dislocation and direct injury in surgery |
| **Suprascapular nerve (C5,6)** | Proximal humerus fracture, scapula fracture, entrapment at suprascapular notch [15] | Supraspinatus weakness (abduction initiation) + infraspinatus weakness (ER); visible wasting in supraspinous/infraspinous fossae | Nerve passes through the rigid suprascapular notch under the transverse scapular ligament → vulnerable to traction and compression |
| ***Long thoracic nerve (C5,6,7)*** | Axillary lymph node dissection, direct trauma to lateral chest wall [17] | ***Serratus anterior paralysis → winging of scapula → pain, weakness, limitation of shoulder elevation*** [17] | Nerve runs superficially along the chest wall on the surface of serratus anterior → easily damaged by surgical retraction or direct trauma |
| ***Thoracodorsal nerve*** | Axillary dissection [17] | ***Latissimus dorsi paralysis → unable to raise trunk with UL (e.g. climbing)*** [17] | Nerve runs through the axilla in close proximity to axillary lymph nodes |
| ***Intercostobrachial nerve*** | Axillary dissection [17] | ***Paraesthesia at triceps area*** (medial upper arm numbness) [17] | Small sensory nerve easily damaged during axillary clearance; most commonly injured nerve in axillary surgery |
| **Musculocutaneous nerve (C5,6,7)** | Arthroscopic portal placement (anterior) | Biceps and brachialis weakness; lateral forearm sensory loss | Nerve pierces coracobrachialis close to the anterior arthroscopic portal |
| **Radial nerve** | Humeral shaft fracture (***Holstein-Lewis fracture***) [15] | ***High radial nerve palsy: wrist drop, finger drop (triceps extension intact), reduced sensation over dorsal 1st webspace*** [15] | Nerve spirals around the posterior humeral shaft in the spiral groove → trapped in spiral fractures of the distal third |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications">

1. ***SAIS complications: rotator cuff degeneration and tear + adhesive capsulitis*** [3] — the two are linked by the impingement → degeneration → pain → disuse → capsular fibrosis cascade.
2. ***RC tear complications: adhesive capsulitis + recurrence*** [3]. Cuff tear arthropathy is the end-stage of massive untreated tears → indication for reverse TSA.
3. ***MUA for frozen shoulder: fracture (esp during ER)*** [3]. ***Capsular release: axillary nerve injury + residual stiffness*** [3].
4. Shoulder dislocation: recurrence (especially in young patients), axillary nerve injury, rotator cuff tear (especially in older patients), secondary OA [15].
5. Septic arthritis destroys cartilage within 48–72 hours — this is why it is an emergency.
6. **Post-stroke shoulder pain** is extremely common (up to 70%) — subluxation, adhesive capsulitis, CRPS-I are the main culprits [16].
7. **Axillary nerve** is the most commonly injured nerve around the shoulder (dislocation, fracture, surgery). Look for deltoid weakness + regimental badge sensory loss.
8. Always think about **CRPS-I** in any patient with disproportionate pain, swelling, and vasomotor changes after shoulder injury or surgery.
