## Differential Diagnosis of Sore Throat Complaints

The differential diagnosis of sore throat is broad because the pharynx sits at a crossroads — where the airway meets the digestive tract, where multiple cranial nerves converge, and where both local and systemic disease can manifest. The key clinical task is **risk stratification**: separating the > 90% of cases that are benign and self-limiting from the handful that are life-threatening or require specific treatment.

The Murtagh diagnostic framework [1] provides a beautifully systematic scaffold. Let me walk through each tier, explain the "why" behind each differential, and then show you how to narrow things down clinically.

---

### 1. Framework for Organising the Differential

The Murtagh approach divides differentials into five tiers:

1. **Probability diagnoses** — what is most likely?
2. **Serious disorders not to be missed** — what will kill or seriously harm the patient?
3. **Pitfalls (often missed)** — what do clinicians commonly overlook?
4. **Masquerades** — common systemic conditions mimicking the complaint
5. **Is the patient trying to tell me something?** — psychosocial/functional overlay

This is not an arbitrary list — it is a **risk-stratification tool** that forces you to think about both probability and severity simultaneously. A viral URTI is 100× more common than epiglottitis, but if you miss epiglottitis the patient dies tonight. That's why both must be on your list.

---

### 2. Probability Diagnoses (Common Causes)

These account for the vast majority of sore throat presentations in primary care.

#### 2.1 ***Viral Pharyngitis*** [1]

The single most common cause (25–45% of all pharyngitis in adults) [3]. Over 200 viral subtypes can do this — ***rhinovirus (30–50%), coronavirus (10–15%), influenza (5–15%), RSV (5%), parainfluenza (5%), adenovirus, enterovirus*** [3].

**Why it causes sore throat:** Viral replication in pharyngeal epithelial cells → cytopathic effect + innate immune activation → inflammatory mediators (bradykinin, prostaglandins) sensitise pharyngeal nociceptors → pain.

**Distinguishing features:** ***Cough (often with fever and malaise), nasal symptoms (congestion, discharge, sneezes), conjunctivitis, hoarseness and other coryzal symptoms, ± oral ulcers, viral exanthem*** [3]. The presence of **cough and nasal symptoms** is the strongest pointer away from bacterial pharyngitis.

#### 2.2 ***Epstein-Barr Mononucleosis (Glandular Fever)*** [1]

EBV infects B lymphocytes via CD21 → massive reactive T cell response → lymphoid tissue hypertrophy (tonsils, nodes, spleen). ***Tonsillitis with a covering membrane may be caused by Epstein-Barr mononucleosis*** [1] — the greyish-white tonsillar exudate mimics bacterial tonsillitis or even diphtheria.

**Distinguishing features:** Posterior cervical and generalised lymphadenopathy (not just anterior cervical), splenomegaly, prolonged fatigue, palatal petechiae, periorbital oedema. ***Nasal stuffiness of infectious mononucleosis*** [1] — due to lymphoid hypertrophy in the nasopharynx.

**Pitfall:** ***Epstein-Barr mononucleosis is a "pitfall (often missed)"*** [1] — because it is frequently misdiagnosed as GAS tonsillitis. If given amoxicillin/ampicillin, ~90% develop a maculopapular rash (not a true allergy; thought to be altered immune response during EBV infection).

#### 2.3 ***Streptococcal (GABHS) Tonsillitis*** [1]

Group A β-haemolytic streptococcus accounts for **5–15% of adult pharyngitis** and **15–30% in children** [3]. It matters not because the pharyngitis itself is dangerous, but because untreated GAS can cause **acute rheumatic fever** (molecular mimicry → anti-M protein antibodies cross-react with cardiac myosin) and **post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis** [7].

**Distinguishing features:** ***Prior close exposure to GAS (esp familial), acute onset of sore throat, exudative tonsillitis, prominent tender anterior cervical adenopathy, fever, headache, abdominal pain ± vomiting, malaise, anorexia, ± rash: scarlatiniform rash, urticaria*** [3]. Critically, **absence of cough** and **absence of nasal symptoms** favour GAS over viral [3].

**The Centor / Modified Centor criteria** [3] help stratify the probability of GAS:

| Criterion | Points |
|---|---|
| History of fever | +1 |
| Tonsillar exudates | +1 |
| Tender anterior cervical adenopathy | +1 |
| Absence of cough | +1 |
| Age < 15 years | +1 |
| Age > 44 years | −1 |

| Score | Risk of GAS | Action |
|---|---|---|
| ***−1 to 1*** | ***< 10%*** | ***No Abx or throat culture necessary*** [3] |
| ***2 to 3*** | ***15–32%*** | ***Abx if throat culture +ve*** [3] |
| ***4 to 5*** | ***~56%*** | ***Treat empirically with Abx*** [3] |

> ***Empiric treatment NOT recommended as the best diagnostic accuracy achievable based on clinical symptoms alone is only 50%*** [3]

#### 2.4 ***Chronic Sinusitis with Postnasal Drip*** [1]

Chronic paranasal sinus inflammation → mucopurulent secretions drain posteriorly → irritation of posterior pharyngeal wall → chronic sore throat and throat-clearing. The patient often says "something is dripping at the back of my throat." Key features include ***prolonged ( > 10–14d) URI symptoms + ≥2 of facial/sinus pain (esp aggravated by postural changes or Valsalva manoeuvre), purulent nasal discharge, fever*** [3].

#### 2.5 ***Oropharyngeal Candidiasis*** [1]

*Candida albicans* overgrowth due to disrupted local defences. ***Common in infants*** [1] (immature immunity), patients on ***steroid inhalers*** [1] (local immunosuppression), ***diabetes*** [1] (hyperglycaemia promotes fungal growth), HIV/AIDS (CD4 depletion), antibiotic use (loss of competing flora), and denture wearers. White, curd-like plaques that scrape off to reveal an erythematous base.

---

### 3. Serious Disorders Not to Be Missed

These are lower probability but potentially fatal or irreversible.

#### 3.1 Cardiovascular: ***Angina / Myocardial Infarction*** [1]

Cardiac ischaemia → visceral pain afferents travel via cardiac sympathetic nerves → converge with somatic afferents from the throat/jaw in upper thoracic spinal cord → brain misinterprets as "throat pain" (referred pain). ***Angina is typically dull, constricting, choking, described as squeezing, crushing, burning*** [10]. Suspect when "sore throat" is exertional, deep, and in a patient with cardiovascular risk factors.

#### 3.2 ***Neoplasia/Cancer: Cancer of Oropharynx, Tongue*** [1]

Three major aetiological pathways in Hong Kong:
- **HPV-driven oropharyngeal SCC** (HPV 16/18): ***HPV-associated H&N cancer occurs primarily in the oropharynx including tonsils and the base of tongue*** [4]. Younger males, ↑ sexual partners.
- **Tobacco/alcohol-driven SCC**: ***synergism between smoking and alcohol is well established*** [4]. Older males. ***5Ss: Smoking + Spirits + Sharp teeth + Sex (male/oral) + Spicy food*** [4].
- **NPC (EBV-driven)**: ***endemic in Southern China including Hong Kong*** [4]. May present insidiously as unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, or — importantly — a painless posterior cervical neck mass.

**Also consider:** ***Minor salivary gland tumours*** — may present as submucosal masses in the tongue base and soft palate [4]. ***Lymphoma*** — tonsils and tongue base may be the presenting site for a lymphoma [4].

> ***The triad — hoarseness, pain on swallowing and referred ear pain → pharyngeal cancer*** [1]

#### 3.3 ***Blood Dyscrasias (e.g. Agranulocytosis, Acute Leukaemia)*** [1]

**Agranulocytosis** (neutrophil count < 0.5 × 10⁹/L): loss of mucosal immune defence → necrotising pharyngitis with ulceration. Common culprit drugs: carbimazole, clozapine, methotrexate, sulphonamides, chemotherapy.

**Acute leukaemia**: bone marrow failure → pancytopenia → neutropenic sore throat + ***anaemic pallor*** [1] + bleeding gums + fatigue + fever. On blood film: ***blasts: always abnormal → if ≥20%, diagnostic of acute leukaemia*** [11]. ***Atypical lymphocytosis*** (NOT neoplastic) can occur in EBV and other viral infections — ***not to be mistaken as blasts or lymphoma cells*** [11].

**Clinical clue:** ***Look for toxicity, the anaemic pallor of leukaemia*** [1] — sore throat with unexplained pallor, bruising, or persistent fever should trigger urgent FBE.

#### 3.4 Infections — Life-Threatening

**(a) *Acute Epiglottitis (Children and Adults)*** [1]

***H. influenzae type b infection of epiglottis esp affecting children resulting in rapid onset fever, dysphonia, dysphagia and respiratory distress (medical emergency)*** [3]. In adults, *Streptococcus* and *Staphylococcus* species are more common. The epiglottis swells rapidly → supraglottic airway obstruction → stridor, drooling, tripod positioning.

***Admit if any suspicion of epiglottitis — and do not examine the throat*** [1] — because pharyngeal manipulation can precipitate complete laryngospasm in an already critically narrowed airway.

**(b) *Peritonsillar Abscess (Quinsy)*** [1]

GAS tonsillitis → infection extends beyond the tonsillar capsule into the peritonsillar space → abscess. Features: severe **unilateral** sore throat, trismus (medial pterygoid irritation), "hot potato" voice, uvular deviation away from the affected side, drooling.

**(c) *Pharyngeal Abscess*** [1]

Retropharyngeal abscess (children < 5y: suppuration of retropharyngeal lymph nodes) or parapharyngeal abscess (adults: extension from dental/tonsillar infection). **Danger:** the retropharyngeal space communicates with the posterior mediastinum → mediastinitis → sepsis.

**(d) *Diphtheria (Very Rare)*** [1]

*Corynebacterium diphtheriae* → exotoxin → epithelial necrosis → grey-white pharyngeal pseudomembrane that bleeds on removal. ***Airway pseudomembrane formation, fever, sore throat, extensive cervical LN ('bull's neck appearance') and rarely peripheral neuritis and myocarditis*** [3]. Rare in HK due to vaccination but consider in unvaccinated/under-vaccinated individuals.

**(e) *HIV/AIDS*** [1]

Acute HIV seroconversion (2–4 weeks post-exposure) → mononucleosis-like syndrome: sore throat, fever, generalised lymphadenopathy, maculopapular rash, oral ulcers. Advanced HIV → opportunistic pharyngeal infections (Candida, HSV, CMV), Kaposi sarcoma, pharyngeal lymphoma.

---

### 4. Pitfalls (Often Missed) [1]

These are commonly overlooked causes that lead to delayed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment.

| Pitfall | Why It's Missed | Key Distinguishing Feature |
|---|---|---|
| ***Foreign body (e.g. fish bone)*** [1] | Patient may not recall the event; X-ray sensitivity limited | Sharp unilateral pain at a specific site, worse swallowing; common in HK (steamed fish culture) |
| ***EBV mononucleosis*** [1] | Mistaken for GAS tonsillitis; membrane mimics diphtheria | Posterior LN, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytes, rash with amoxicillin |
| ***Candida (steroid inhalers)*** [1] | Inhaler technique not assessed; patient not asked | White scrapeable plaques; history of inhaled corticosteroid use |
| ***STIs: gonococcal pharyngitis, herpes simplex (type II), syphilis*** [1] | Sexual history not taken; pharyngeal gonorrhoea often asymptomatic | Exposure history; HSV → vesicles/ulcers; syphilis → painless chancre or mucous patches; gonorrhoea → NAAT of throat swab |
| ***Reflux oesophagitis → pharyngolaryngitis (LPR)*** [1] | No classic heartburn; patient presents to ENT not GI | Throat clearing, globus, hoarseness, chronic cough; ***water brash: reflex salivary gland stimulation as acid enters throat*** [5]; ***may present initially to RESP, CARD or ENT*** [5] |
| ***Tonsilloliths*** [1] | Dismissed as "chronic tonsillitis" | Halitosis, recurrent sore throat, white/yellow concretions visible in tonsillar crypts |
| ***Cricopharyngeal spasm*** [1] | Functional symptom; no organic finding | Globus sensation ("lump in throat") without true pain or dysphagia; often stress-related |
| ***Kawasaki disease*** [1] | Pharyngitis attributed to simple viral infection | Child < 5y, high fever > 5 days, bilateral conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, polymorphous rash, extremity changes, cervical LN |
| ***Aphthous ulceration*** [1] | Recurrent; attributed to "mouth ulcers" not investigated | Recurrent painful ulcers; if deep/multiple → consider Behçet disease |
| ***Thyroiditis*** [1] | Anterior neck pain misinterpreted as throat pain | Tender thyroid, pain ***radiates to angle of jaw and ears, ↑ by swallowing, coughing, movement of neck*** [9]; elevated ESR; fluctuating thyroid status |
| ***Glossopharyngeal neuralgia*** [1] | Very rare; lancinating pain mistaken for infection | Severe, brief, lancinating pain in throat/ear triggered by swallowing/coughing/talking; analogous to trigeminal neuralgia for CN V |
| ***Chronic mouth breathing*** [1] | Not recognised as a cause of mucosal drying | Sore/dry throat worse in mornings, nasal obstruction (polyps, deviated septum, adenoid hypertrophy) |
| ***Irritants (e.g. cigarette smoke, chemicals)*** [1] | Attributed to "viral" without exploring occupational/social Hx | Chronic sore throat in smoker or with occupational chemical exposure; no infective features |

<Callout title="HSV Pharyngitis — A Commonly Missed STI" type="error">
***Herpes simplex (type II)*** [1] pharyngitis presents with painful vesicles and shallow ulcers on the pharyngeal mucosa, often in sexually active young adults after orogenital contact. ***Predilection: H&N mucocutaneous surface for HSV-1 vs genital mucosa for HSV-2*** [12], but either type can affect the pharynx. ***Primary infection: majority asymptomatic (except in elderly)*** [12] — meaning many cases are subclinical. In immunocompromised patients, HSV can cause severe erosive pharyngitis or oesophagitis. Diagnosis is by ***vesicular fluid for PCR for HSV DNA*** [12] — ***serology is of limited value as a substantial proportion of the population is seropositive*** [12].
</Callout>

### 5. Masquerades Checklist [1]

These are common systemic conditions that can present as sore throat but whose primary pathology lies elsewhere.

| Masquerade | Mechanism | How to Unmask |
|---|---|---|
| ***Depression*** [1] | Somatisation → globus pharyngeus, functional throat discomfort; ***the association with depression is significant*** [1] | Screen for depressive features (PHQ-2/9); no organic cause found on examination |
| ***Diabetes*** [1] | Hyperglycaemia → ↑ fungal growth + neutrophil dysfunction → oropharyngeal candidiasis | ***Blood sugar*** [1] — check fasting glucose/HbA1c; look for oral thrush |
| ***Drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, cytotoxics)*** [1] | NSAIDs → direct mucosal irritation (COX-1 inhibition → ↓ mucosal prostaglandins → impaired mucosal defences); Cytotoxics → mucositis (rapidly dividing mucosal epithelium destroyed) + neutropenia → secondary infection; Carbimazole → agranulocytosis | Detailed drug history; FBE if on high-risk drugs |
| ***Anaemia (possible)*** [1] | Iron deficiency → mucosal atrophy + Plummer-Vinson syndrome (pharyngeal/oesophageal web + glossitis + koilonychia); Severe anaemia → ↓ tissue oxygenation → mucosal fragility | FBE; check for glossitis, angular cheilitis, koilonychia |
| ***Thyroid disorder (thyroiditis)*** [1] | Subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis: post-viral granulomatous thyroid inflammation → anterior neck pain radiating to throat/ear | Tender thyroid on palpation; TFTs (fluctuating); ESR markedly elevated |
| ***Spinal dysfunction (cervical referred pain)*** [1] | C2–C3 facet joint or disc pathology → pain referred to pharyngeal region via upper cervical nerves that converge with pharyngeal sensory afferents | Pain reproduced by neck movement/palpation; no pharyngeal abnormality on examination |

> ***Is the patient trying to tell me something? Unlikely, but the association with depression is significant.*** [1]

---

### 6. Rare Causes [1]

| Condition | Mechanism | HK Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Scleroderma*** [1] | Oesophageal dysmotility (smooth muscle fibrosis) → severe GERD → LPR → pharyngolaryngeal irritation | Uncommon; look for skin tightening, Raynaud's, sclerodactyly |
| ***Behçet disease*** [1] | Systemic vasculitis → recurrent deep oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis; ***strongly a/w HLA-B51 in Asians*** | Along the ancient Silk Road including China; recurrent, deep, painful oral ulcers |
| ***Sarcoidosis*** [1] | Non-caseating granulomas can involve pharynx, larynx, salivary glands | Uncommon in HK Chinese population |
| ***Malignant granuloma*** [1] | Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: EBV-associated destructive midline lesion | More common in East Asia and HK; presents as progressive nasal/pharyngeal destruction |
| ***Tuberculosis*** [1] | Pharyngeal/laryngeal TB — usually secondary to pulmonary TB; granulomatous inflammation of pharynx/larynx → extremely painful sore throat + hoarseness | TB still relevant in HK; consider in chronic sore throat with risk factors |

---

### 7. Differentiating by Time Course

A practical clinical shortcut is to separate **acute** ( < 2 weeks) from **chronic** ( > 3–6 weeks) sore throat, because the differential shifts dramatically:

| Acute Sore Throat | Chronic/Recurrent Sore Throat |
|---|---|
| Viral pharyngitis (most common) | LPR / GERD |
| GAS tonsillitis | Chronic sinusitis with postnasal drip |
| EBV mononucleosis | Malignancy (NPC, SCC, lymphoma) |
| Peritonsillar abscess | Chronic/recurrent tonsillitis, tonsilloliths |
| Epiglottitis | Irritants (smoking, chemicals) |
| Retropharyngeal abscess | Oropharyngeal candidiasis |
| Diphtheria (rare) | TB (rare) |
| Acute HIV seroconversion | Drug-related (NSAIDs, cytotoxics) |
| Foreign body | Behçet disease |
| Kawasaki (children) | Thyroiditis |
| | Cervical spine dysfunction |
| | Depression / globus |
| | Plummer-Vinson syndrome (iron deficiency) |

---

### 8. Differentiating by Key Clinical Features

This table helps you narrow the differential when specific clinical features are present:

| Clinical Feature | Narrows DDx Towards |
|---|---|
| **Cough + rhinorrhoea + low-grade fever** | Viral pharyngitis [3] |
| **High fever + exudates + anterior cervical LN + no cough** | GAS tonsillitis → Centor score [3] |
| **Exudates + posterior LN + splenomegaly + fatigue** | EBV mononucleosis [1] |
| **Unilateral sore throat + trismus + uvular deviation** | Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) [1] |
| **Stridor + drooling + toxic appearance + tripod position** | Epiglottitis [1][3] |
| **Hoarseness + dysphagia + referred otalgia** | Pharyngeal / laryngeal cancer [1][6] |
| **Painless neck mass + nasal obstruction + epistaxis** | Nasopharyngeal carcinoma [4] |
| **White scrapeable plaques** | Oropharyngeal candidiasis [1] |
| **Grey pseudomembrane + bull neck + toxicity** | Diphtheria [3] |
| **Pallor + bruising + persistent fever + severe ulceration** | Blood dyscrasia (agranulocytosis, leukaemia) [1][11] |
| **Vesicles/shallow ulcers on pharyngeal mucosa** | HSV pharyngitis [12] |
| **Anterior neck tenderness + elevated ESR + fluctuating TFTs** | Subacute thyroiditis [9] |
| **Throat clearing + globus + no heartburn** | LPR [5] |
| **Sharp unilateral pain at specific point after eating fish** | Foreign body (fish bone) [1] |
| **Child < 5y + fever > 5 days + conjunctivitis + rash** | Kawasaki disease [1] |
| **Recurrent deep oral ulcers + genital ulcers + uveitis** | Behçet disease [1] |

### 10. Lemierre Syndrome — A Must-Know Rare Complication

Worth singling out because it is a life-threatening complication of pharyngitis that is classically tested:

- **Organism:** ***Fusobacterium necrophorum*** [3] — an anaerobic gram-negative rod that normally colonises the oropharynx
- **Pathophysiology:** Pharyngitis/peritonsillar infection → bacterial invasion into the parapharyngeal space → ***septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV)*** → septic emboli to lungs (cavitating pneumonia), joints, liver, brain
- **Classic presentation:** Young adult with pharyngitis → apparent recovery → then acutely unwell with high spiking fevers, rigors, unilateral neck tenderness/swelling (IJV thrombosis), and respiratory symptoms (septic pulmonary emboli)
- **Why you must know this:** It is called the "forgotten disease" because it was common in the pre-antibiotic era, became rare, and is now re-emerging partly due to restrictive antibiotic prescribing for pharyngitis

<Callout title="Key Investigations to Consider" type="idea">

***Key investigations: Consider throat swab, FBE, mononucleosis test, blood sugar, biopsy of suspicious lesions*** [1].

- **Throat swab / RADT**: to identify GAS → decide on antibiotics
- **FBE (full blood examination)**: to screen for blood dyscrasias (neutropenia, leukaemia, atypical lymphocytes of EBV)
- **Monospot / EBV serology**: if EBV mononucleosis suspected
- **Blood sugar**: to unmask diabetes → explain candidiasis
- **Biopsy**: for any suspicious persistent lesion → rule out malignancy

These investigations map directly to the differentials above — each test targets a specific tier of the diagnostic framework.
</Callout>

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **The Murtagh framework** structures the DDx into probability diagnoses, serious disorders, pitfalls, masquerades, and psychosocial overlay [1].

2. ***Probability diagnoses: viral pharyngitis, EBV mononucleosis, GAS tonsillitis, chronic sinusitis with PND, oropharyngeal candidiasis*** [1].

3. ***Serious disorders: angina/MI, oropharyngeal/tongue cancer, blood dyscrasias, epiglottitis, peritonsillar abscess, pharyngeal abscess, diphtheria, HIV*** [1].

4. **Centor criteria** stratify GAS risk; absence of cough is the most discriminating feature. ***Empiric treatment NOT recommended — clinical symptoms alone achieve only 50% accuracy*** [3].

5. ***EBV is a pitfall*** — mimics GAS with exudates; look for posterior LN, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytes. Amoxicillin triggers rash.

6. ***Triad of hoarseness + odynophagia + referred otalgia = pharyngeal cancer until proven otherwise*** [1].

7. **Acute unilateral sore throat + trismus + uvular deviation** = peritonsillar abscess.

8. **Stridor/drooling/inability to speak** = airway emergency → ***admit immediately, do NOT examine the throat*** if epiglottitis suspected [1].

9. **Chronic sore throat > 3 weeks** shifts the DDx towards malignancy, LPR, chronic sinusitis, irritants, and systemic masquerades.

10. ***Key investigations: throat swab, FBE, monospot, blood sugar, biopsy of suspicious lesions*** [1].

11. In HK, always consider **NPC** (EBV-driven, endemic) and **extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma** (EBV-associated, East Asian predilection) in the malignancy differential.

Agranulocytosis (absolute neutrophil count less than 0.5 x 10^9/L) - loss of mucosal immune defence leads to necrotising pharyngitis; commonly drug-induced (carbimazole, clozapine, methotrexate). 2. Acute leukaemia - bone marrow failure causes pancytopenia with neutropenic infections (sore throat), anaemia (pallor), and thrombocytopenia (bleeding). Blood film may show blasts; if 20% or more blasts, this is diagnostic of acute leukaemia."
