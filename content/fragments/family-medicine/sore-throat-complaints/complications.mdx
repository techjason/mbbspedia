## Complications of Sore Throat Complaints

Complications of sore throat are best understood by organising them according to the underlying diagnosis. The reason this matters is that the complications are NOT random — they follow directly from the pathophysiology of each condition. A viral pharyngitis complicates differently from GAS tonsillitis, which complicates differently from a peritonsillar abscess. Let me walk through each systematically, always explaining the "why."

---

### 1. Complications of Viral Pharyngitis / Acute Coryza

Viral pharyngitis is usually self-limiting, but it can set the stage for secondary problems:

#### 1.1 ***Acute Rhinosinusitis*** [3]

***Due to ↓ mucociliary clearance with viral infection of mucosa*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:** Viral infection of the nasal/sinus epithelium → ciliated epithelial cells are damaged and destroyed → mucociliary escalator fails → mucus stagnates in the paranasal sinuses → sinus ostia become oedematous and blocked → trapped secretions become a perfect culture medium for secondary bacterial infection (*S. pneumoniae*, *H. influenzae*, *M. catarrhalis*). This is why sinusitis typically develops 7–10 days into a viral URTI — the initial phase is viral, but bacterial superinfection follows.

#### 1.2 ***Lower Respiratory Involvement*** [3]

***Due to RSV, parainfluenza, influenza involvement of lungs*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:** These viruses have tropism for lower airway epithelium as well as upper — they descend along the respiratory tract → bronchiolitis (RSV, especially in infants), viral pneumonia (influenza), or tracheobronchitis (parainfluenza). In previously healthy adults this is usually mild, but in the elderly, immunocompromised, or those with chronic lung disease it can be life-threatening.

#### 1.3 ***Asthma Exacerbation*** [3]

***? Due to ↑ airway hyperreactivity with local inflammation*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:** Viral infection of airway epithelium → release of inflammatory mediators (leukotrienes, histamine, IL-4, IL-13) + damage to the epithelial barrier → exposure of submucosal nerve endings → heightened bronchial hyperresponsiveness → bronchospasm in predisposed individuals. This is the most common trigger for asthma exacerbations in both children and adults.

#### 1.4 ***Acute Otitis Media (Especially in Children)*** [3]

***Due to Eustachian tube dysfunction and bacterial translocation from upper respiratory tract*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:** Viral URTI → inflammation and oedema of the Eustachian tube mucosa → tube becomes blocked → negative middle ear pressure develops → effusion accumulates → bacteria from the nasopharynx ascend through the dysfunctional tube → acute otitis media. Children are particularly susceptible because their Eustachian tubes are shorter, more horizontal, and more compliant (collapse more easily).

#### 1.5 ***Post-viral Cough*** [3]

***Commonly persists past the time nasal and throat symptoms resolve*** [3].

**Pathophysiology:** Viral-induced damage to the airway epithelium → exposed sensory nerve endings (C-fibres) → heightened cough reflex sensitivity. This takes weeks to heal. The cough is dry, irritating, and can last ***3–8 weeks*** [3]. Important to distinguish from secondary bacterial infection (which would present with new fever, purulent sputum, and focal chest signs).

---

### 2. Complications of GAS Pharyngitis

These are the complications that make GAS pharyngitis clinically important — without them, we would treat it the same as viral pharyngitis (i.e., supportively). GAS complications are classically divided into **suppurative** (direct bacterial spread) and **non-suppurative** (immune-mediated, delayed).

#### 2.1 Suppurative Complications (Local Spread of Infection)

##### 2.1.1 ***Peritonsillar Abscess (Quinsy)*** [1]

**Pathophysiology:** GAS infection breaches the tonsillar capsule → spreads into the potential space between the capsule and the superior constrictor muscle (the peritonsillar space) → pus accumulates → abscess forms. The abscess compresses adjacent structures: the medial pterygoid muscle (→ trismus), the soft palate (→ uvular deviation), and the pharyngeal airway (→ "hot potato" voice, potential airway obstruction).

**Frequency:** Most common suppurative complication of tonsillitis. Typically occurs in adolescents and young adults.

**Consequences if untreated:** Can extend into the parapharyngeal space → carotid sheath involvement → internal jugular vein thrombosis → or extend inferiorly to mediastinum → mediastinitis → sepsis → death.

##### 2.1.2 ***Pharyngeal (Retropharyngeal) Abscess*** [1]

**Pathophysiology:** Infection from the pharynx drains to the retropharyngeal lymph nodes (which sit between the pharyngeal constrictor muscles and the prevertebral fascia) → nodes suppurate → retropharyngeal abscess. This space communicates directly with the posterior mediastinum (no fascial barrier below the level of the T4 vertebra) → potential for catastrophic mediastinitis.

**Key population:** Children < 5 years (retropharyngeal nodes are prominent in this age group and atrophy by age 6). In adults, usually occurs after penetrating pharyngeal trauma or instrumentation.

##### 2.1.3 Cervical Lymphadenitis / Suppurative Lymphadenitis

**Pathophysiology:** GAS spreads from the tonsils via lymphatics to the draining cervical lymph nodes (primarily jugulodigastric/level II) → bacterial replication within the node overwhelms local immune defences → node becomes filled with pus. Presents as a tender, fluctuant neck mass with overlying erythema and fever.

##### 2.1.4 Lemierre Syndrome (Septic IJV Thrombophlebitis)

***Classically associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum*** [3] — an anaerobic gram-negative rod that normally colonises the pharynx.

**Pathophysiology:** Pharyngeal/peritonsillar infection → bacteria invade the lateral pharyngeal space → reach the internal jugular vein (IJV) → infect the vein wall (phlebitis) → thrombus forms within the IJV (septic thrombosis) → fragments of infected thrombus break off → septic emboli travel to the lungs (→ cavitating pneumonia, lung abscesses), joints (→ septic arthritis), liver (→ hepatic abscesses), brain (→ meningitis, brain abscess).

***Classically a/w Lemierre syndrome (septic thrombophlebitis of IJV) with risk of carotid blowout and other devastating consequences*** [3].

**"The forgotten disease"** — was common in the pre-antibiotic era, became rare, and is now re-emerging.

##### 2.1.5 Other Rare Suppurative Complications

- **Otitis media** (bacterial spread to middle ear via Eustachian tube)
- **Sinusitis** (bacterial spread to paranasal sinuses)
- **Mastoiditis** (extension from middle ear to mastoid air cells)
- **Meningitis** (rare — haematogenous spread or direct extension from retropharyngeal abscess)
- **Necrotising fasciitis** (rare but devastating — GAS invades deep fascial planes of the neck)

#### 2.2 Non-Suppurative Complications (Immune-Mediated)

These occur **days to weeks** after the initial pharyngitis — not from direct bacterial spread, but from the immune response to GAS antigens.

##### 2.2.1 ***Acute Rheumatic Fever (ARF)*** [7]

This is the most important non-suppurative complication and the primary reason we treat GAS pharyngitis with antibiotics.

***Pathophysiology: molecular mimicry*** [7]

- ***Delayed immune response to infection with certain strains of GAS*** [7]
- ***Cross-reactiveness targeting cardiac proteins (anti-M)*** [7]
- ***Result: inflammation in endocardium, myocardium and pericardium*** [7]

**Step-by-step mechanism:**
1. GAS M protein is structurally similar to human cardiac myosin, laminin, tropomyosin, and keratin
2. During the pharyngeal infection, the immune system generates antibodies against GAS M protein
3. These anti-M antibodies cross-react with cardiac proteins → bind to cardiac tissue → activate complement → recruit inflammatory cells → **pancarditis**
4. T cells sensitised to streptococcal antigens also cross-react with cardiac valve tissue → ongoing inflammation

***Clinical S/S: preceded by strep throat 2–3 weeks before*** [7]:
- ***Pancarditis*** [7]: ***Characteristically, rheumatic heart disease is the only disease that affects all three layers of the heart*** [7] — endocarditis (valvulitis → murmurs), myocarditis (heart failure), pericarditis (effusion, friction rub). ***Murmurs: transient MR/AR murmur, MDM at apex (Carey-Coombs murmur)*** [7]
- ***Arthritis (75%): asymmetrical, predominantly large joints*** [7] — migratory polyarthritis (the arthritis "migrates" because immune complexes deposit sequentially in different joints)
- ***Sydenham's chorea*** [7]: T cell-mediated damage to basal ganglia (caudate and putamen) → involuntary choreiform movements
- ***Erythema marginatum ( < 5%)*** [7]: immune complex deposition in dermal vessels
- ***Subcutaneous nodules (5–7%)*** [7]: granulomatous reaction over bony prominences

##### 2.2.2 Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease

***Occurs in ≥1/2 of all ARF patients, but typically takes 10–30 years to become manifest*** [7].

***Pathogenesis: repeated ARF attacks → progressive fibrosis → fusion/distortion of cusps*** [7].

**Why does it progress?** Each episode of ARF causes a round of inflammatory damage to the valves. During healing, the damaged valve tissue is replaced by fibrosis. Repeated episodes → cumulative fibrosis → thickening, calcification, and fusion of valve leaflets and chordae tendinae. The mitral valve is most commonly affected because it endures the highest mechanical stress (left-sided pressures).

***Affects: Site — MV alone, AV+MV, AV alone, TV (rare). Pathology — MS > MR+MS > MR*** [7].

***Important cause of chronic VHD but ↓ incidence (∵ good Abx management of GAS pharyngitis)*** [7].

<Callout title="Why Does Treating GAS Pharyngitis Prevent Rheumatic Fever?">
Antibiotics eradicate GAS from the pharynx within 24–48 hours. This removes the ongoing antigenic stimulus that drives the immune response. Without persistent antigen exposure, the cross-reactive immune response does not develop sufficiently to cause tissue damage. Antibiotics started within 9 days of symptom onset reduce ARF risk by approximately 80%. This is why a 10-day course of penicillin is prescribed even though the sore throat itself would resolve in 3–5 days. The antibiotics are not for symptom relief — they are for rheumatic fever prevention.
</Callout>

##### 2.2.3 Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN)

**Pathophysiology:** Immune complexes (streptococcal antigen–antibody complexes) deposit in the glomerular basement membrane → activate complement (C3 consumption → low C3) → inflammatory cascade → proliferative glomerulonephritis.

**Timing:** 1–3 weeks after pharyngeal GAS infection (or 3–6 weeks after skin GAS infection).

***Clinical findings: acute nephritis — haematuria, variable proteinuria, renal impairment*** [15].

***Diagnosis: clinical findings of acute nephritis + documentation of recent GAS infection by culture or serology*** [15].

**Key distinguishing feature from IgA nephropathy:** PSGN occurs 1–3 weeks **after** pharyngitis (latent period for immune complex formation), whereas ***IgA nephropathy is classically synpharyngitic (usually within 5 days of URTI)*** [15] — the haematuria occurs simultaneously with the URTI, not after a delay.

***Prognosis: majority have excellent outcome especially children*** [15]. ***However, some patients develop glomerulosclerosis → HTN, recurrent proteinuria and renal insufficiency 10–40 years after initial illness*** [15].

**Important note:** Unlike ARF, antibiotics do NOT reliably prevent PSGN. The immune complex formation may already be underway by the time pharyngitis is recognised. ***ARF prophylaxis is generally useful ≤9 days of onset (but less clear for other complications)*** [3].

##### 2.2.4 Post-Streptococcal Reactive Arthritis (PSRA)

A milder form of post-streptococcal joint inflammation that does not fulfil Jones criteria for ARF. Non-migratory, involves large or small joints, onset 1–2 weeks post-infection. Important because some cases may progress to carditis — these patients should be monitored and some guidelines recommend secondary prophylaxis.

##### 2.2.5 Scarlet Fever

Strictly speaking, scarlet fever is a **toxin-mediated complication** of GAS pharyngitis, not a true immune-mediated post-infectious complication.

**Pathophysiology:** Certain strains of GAS produce streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins (SPE A, B, C) → these act as **superantigens** → non-specific activation of up to 20% of all T cells (vs. < 0.01% with conventional antigens) → massive cytokine release → diffuse erythematous rash with sandpaper texture, Pastia's lines (accentuated rash in skin folds), strawberry tongue, and circumoral pallor.

##### 2.2.6 Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococci (PANDAS)

A controversial entity: acute onset OCD or tic disorder temporally related to GAS infection, hypothesised to be caused by anti-neuronal antibodies cross-reacting with basal ganglia (similar mechanism to Sydenham's chorea but with psychiatric rather than motor manifestations).

---

### 3. Complications of EBV Infectious Mononucleosis

#### 3.1 Splenic Rupture

**Pathophysiology:** EBV causes massive lymphocytic infiltration of the splenic white pulp → splenomegaly (50–60% of IM patients) → the enlarged spleen is fragile, with a thinned and stretched capsule → vulnerable to rupture with even minor trauma.

**Clinical significance:** The most feared acute complication. Occurs in ~0.1–0.5% of IM cases. Presents as sudden left upper quadrant pain, haemodynamic collapse, and referred pain to the left shoulder (Kehr's sign — phrenic nerve irritation by diaphragmatic blood). This is why patients are advised to avoid contact sports for 4–6 weeks.

#### 3.2 Airway Obstruction

**Pathophysiology:** Bilateral tonsillar hypertrophy (massive lymphoid expansion) → can virtually meet in the midline ("kissing tonsils") → oropharyngeal airway obstruction. This is one of the indications for systemic corticosteroids in IM.

#### 3.3 Haematological Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia** | Polyclonal B cell activation → production of cold agglutinins (anti-i IgM) → complement-mediated RBC lysis | 0.5–3% |
| **Thrombocytopenia** | Anti-platelet antibodies + splenic sequestration | 25–50% (mild); severe < 1% |
| **Aplastic anaemia** | Rarely, EBV-triggered immune destruction of haematopoietic stem cells | Very rare |

#### 3.4 Neurological Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Guillain-Barré syndrome** | Post-infectious autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves; EBV is a recognised trigger |
| **Encephalitis/meningitis** | Direct viral invasion of CNS or immune-mediated |
| **Cranial nerve palsies** | Particularly CN VII (Bell's palsy); mechanism likely immune-mediated |

#### 3.5 Hepatitis

Mild transaminase elevation occurs in up to 80% of IM patients (EBV-infected B cells and reactive T cells infiltrate the liver). Clinically significant hepatitis (jaundice) occurs in < 5%. Rarely, fulminant hepatic failure.

#### 3.6 Late Sequelae of EBV Infection

***Late sequelae: chronic infection associated with malignancies (e.g. NPC, lymphoma)*** [3].

| Malignancy | Mechanism | HK Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)** | EBV establishes latent infection in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells → expression of viral oncoproteins (LMP1, LMP2, EBNA1) → promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, promote angiogenesis | ***Endemic in Southern China including Hong Kong*** [1] |
| **Burkitt lymphoma** | EBV-driven B cell proliferation → in the setting of chronic malaria co-infection (endemic African type) or immunosuppression → c-MYC translocation → aggressive B cell lymphoma | Less common in HK; more relevant in equatorial Africa |
| **Hodgkin lymphoma** | EBV found in Reed-Sternberg cells in ~40% of HL cases; viral proteins promote survival of malignant cells | Moderate relevance |
| **Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)** | Immunosuppression → loss of T cell control of EBV-infected B cells → uncontrolled B cell proliferation | Relevant in HK transplant population |
| ***NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type*** | EBV-associated, ***Waldeyer ring involvement → sore throat, noisy obstructed breathing; palatal ulcer/perforation in NK cell lymphoma in Asians*** [16] | More common in East Asia |

---

### 4. Complications of Peritonsillar Abscess

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Airway obstruction** | Expanding abscess displaces tonsil and soft palate medially → pharyngeal lumen narrows |
| **Parapharyngeal space extension** | Pus breaches the superior constrictor muscle → enters the parapharyngeal space (contains the carotid sheath with ICA, IJV, CN IX–XII) |
| **Mediastinitis** | Parapharyngeal/retropharyngeal infection tracks inferiorly into the posterior mediastinum → fulminant mediastinitis → sepsis → high mortality |
| **Internal jugular vein thrombosis** | Inflammation spreads to the IJV wall → thrombophlebitis → can progress to Lemierre syndrome |
| **Carotid artery erosion ("carotid blowout")** | Infection erodes the wall of the ICA → catastrophic haemorrhage. Extremely rare but rapidly fatal. |
| **Aspiration pneumonia** | Pus ruptures into the pharynx → aspiration into the lower airways → pneumonia/lung abscess |

---

### 5. Complications of Epiglottitis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Complete airway obstruction** | Progressive supraglottic oedema → total occlusion → asphyxiation and death if not emergently managed. This is why epiglottitis is a true medical emergency. |
| **Sepsis / bacteraemia** | Invasive bacterial infection from epiglottis → haematogenous spread → sepsis, meningitis, septic arthritis |
| **Epiglottic abscess** | Localised pus formation within the swollen epiglottis → further airway compromise |

---

### 6. Complications of Diphtheria

***Diphtheria (very rare)*** [1] — but its complications are devastating because the exotoxin causes **distant organ damage**:

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Airway obstruction** | Acute | Pharyngeal pseudomembrane physically obstructs the airway; can extend to involve the larynx and trachea |
| ***Myocarditis*** [3] | 1–2 weeks | Diphtheria toxin inhibits protein synthesis (ADP-ribosylation of EF-2) in cardiomyocytes → cell necrosis → conduction defects (heart block), arrhythmias, heart failure. The most common cause of death. |
| ***Peripheral neuritis*** [3] | 2–8 weeks | Toxin damages Schwann cells → demyelination of peripheral nerves. Classic pattern: palatal palsy (nasal voice, nasal regurgitation) → ocular palsies → peripheral limb neuropathy. Usually reversible. |
| **Renal tubular necrosis** | 1–2 weeks | Toxin-mediated damage to renal tubular epithelium |

---

### 7. Complications of Oropharyngeal Candidiasis

| Complication | Mechanism | Risk Group |
|---|---|---|
| **Oesophageal candidiasis** | Fungal infection extends from oropharynx down into the oesophagus → odynophagia, dysphagia, retrosternal pain | HIV/AIDS (CD4 < 200), transplant recipients, haematological malignancy |
| **Candidaemia / invasive candidiasis** | Mucosal breakdown allows Candida to invade the bloodstream → disseminated infection → endophthalmitis, endocarditis, hepatosplenic candidiasis | Severely immunocompromised, central venous catheter, neutropenia |
| **Nutritional compromise** | Painful oral lesions → reduced oral intake → malnutrition and dehydration | Infants, elderly, debilitated patients |

---

### 8. Complications of GERD / LPR

***Reflux oesophagitis → pharyngolaryngitis*** [1] — chronic acid and pepsin exposure damages tissues at multiple levels:

| Complication | Site | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Oesophagitis** | Oesophagus | Acid + pepsin damage oesophageal squamous epithelium → inflammation, erosions, ulceration |
| **Oesophageal stricture** | Oesophagus | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → luminal narrowing → progressive dysphagia (initially to solids) |
| **Barrett's oesophagus** | Oesophagus | Chronic acid damage → metaplasia: normal squamous epithelium replaced by intestinal-type columnar epithelium (goblet cells) → premalignant (risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma ~0.5%/year) |
| **Laryngeal granuloma / contact ulcer** | Larynx (posterior) | Acid/pepsin damages posterior glottic mucosa (the area of most contact during phonation) → granulation tissue forms over the arytenoid cartilage |
| **Subglottic stenosis** | Subglottis | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → circumferential narrowing below the vocal cords → stridor |
| **Dental erosion** | Teeth | Acid dissolves tooth enamel (especially lingual surfaces of upper teeth — the side facing the palate, where refluxate contacts) |
| **Recurrent aspiration pneumonia** | Lungs | Micro-aspiration of gastric content → chemical pneumonitis → bacterial superinfection |

---

### 9. Complications of Head & Neck Malignancy

These are the complications of the tumour itself and of its treatment:

#### 9.1 Tumour Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Airway obstruction** | Tumour mass physically narrows the airway (especially supraglottic and subglottic cancers) |
| **Dysphagia / malnutrition / cachexia** | Tumour obstructs the pharynx/oesophageal inlet → inability to swallow → weight loss. Tumour-derived cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) also cause cancer cachexia (hypermetabolism + anorexia). |
| **Cranial nerve palsies** | NPC at the skull base can invade the cavernous sinus → CN III, IV, V₁, V₂, VI palsies. Laryngeal cancer can invade the recurrent laryngeal nerve → vocal cord palsy. |
| **Cervical lymph node metastasis** | Lymphatic spread to cervical nodes; NPC classically bilateral posterior cervical nodes |
| **Distant metastasis** | NPC: bone (75%), liver, lung, distant LN. Laryngeal cancer: lung most common distant site |

#### 9.2 Treatment Complications

| Treatment | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Radiotherapy** | Mucositis (acute — painful erythema and ulceration of irradiated mucosa), xerostomia (chronic — salivary gland destruction → dry mouth → ↑ dental caries and oral candidiasis), osteoradionecrosis of the mandible, radiation-induced hypothyroidism, secondary malignancy |
| **Chemotherapy** | Mucositis, immunosuppression/neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, nephrotoxicity (cisplatin), ototoxicity (cisplatin), neuropathy |
| **Surgery** | Depending on the procedure: disfigurement, speech impairment, swallowing difficulty, aspiration. For thyroidectomy (if performed for adjacent thyroid cancer or as part of laryngectomy): ***recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypoparathyroidism leading to hypocalcaemia*** [17] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **GAS pharyngitis complications** are the most clinically important: ***suppurative*** (peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, Lemierre syndrome) and ***non-suppurative*** (ARF, PSGN, scarlet fever). This is why we treat GAS with antibiotics.

2. ***ARF*** is caused by ***molecular mimicry — cross-reactiveness targeting cardiac proteins (anti-M)*** [7]. It is the ONLY indication for treating GAS pharyngitis with antibiotics from a public health perspective. Antibiotics started within 9 days of symptom onset reduce ARF risk by ~80%.

3. ***Chronic rheumatic heart disease occurs in ≥1/2 of ARF patients, takes 10–30 years to manifest, and causes MS > MR+MS > MR*** [7]. It remains an important cause of valvular heart disease globally.

4. ***PSGN*** occurs 1–3 weeks after pharyngitis (delayed — immune complex deposition) vs ***IgA nephropathy is synpharyngitic*** [15] (simultaneous with URTI). Antibiotics do NOT reliably prevent PSGN.

5. **EBV complications:** Splenic rupture (avoid contact sports 4–6 weeks), airway obstruction (steroids if severe), haematological (AIHA, thrombocytopenia), neurological (GBS, encephalitis), and ***late malignancies (NPC, lymphoma)*** [3].

6. **Peritonsillar abscess** can lead to parapharyngeal spread → **mediastinitis** (posterior mediastinal communication) → death. Always drain the abscess.

7. **Diphtheria** complications are toxin-mediated: ***myocarditis (most common cause of death) and peripheral neuritis*** [3]. Antitoxin must be given immediately.

8. **Lemierre syndrome**: ***septic thrombophlebitis of IJV from Fusobacterium necrophorum*** [3] → septic pulmonary emboli, carotid blowout. The "forgotten disease."

9. **GERD/LPR** chronic complications include Barrett's oesophagus (premalignant), strictures, and laryngeal granuloma.

10. **Viral pharyngitis** complications are usually self-limiting secondary infections (sinusitis, AOM) and asthma exacerbation.

The enlarged spleen has a thinned, stretched capsule making it vulnerable to rupture with even minor abdominal trauma. Splenic rupture (occurring in 0.1-0.5% of IM cases) presents as sudden left upper quadrant pain, haemodynamic collapse and Kehr's sign (referred left shoulder pain from phrenic nerve irritation by blood under the diaphragm).

      markscheme: "Timing is the key differentiator. PSGN: haematuria occurs 1-3 weeks AFTER the pharyngitis (latent period required for immune complex formation and complement activation). IgA nephropathy: haematuria is synpharyngitic, occurring within 5 days of URTI onset (simultaneous, no latent period - preformed IgA deposits in glomeruli). Other distinguishing features: PSGN has low C3 (complement consumption by immune complexes) while IgAN typically does NOT have low complement. PSGN is usually a single episode with excellent prognosis; IgAN is characterised by recurrent episodic haematuria with each URTI episode."

Mechanism of cardiac damage: Diphtheria exotoxin catalyses ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) in cardiomyocytes, irreversibly inhibiting protein synthesis. Without new protein production, cardiomyocytes undergo necrosis. This leads to conduction defects (heart block), arrhythmias and heart failure. Occurs 1-2 weeks after pharyngeal infection. This is why diphtheria antitoxin must be given immediately - once toxin is bound to cells, antitoxin cannot reverse the damage."

Mechanism: The retropharyngeal space (between the pharyngeal constrictors and prevertebral fascia) communicates directly with the posterior mediastinum - there is no fascial barrier below T4. Infection can track inferiorly causing fulminant mediastinitis with sepsis, which carries very high mortality.

(2) Lower respiratory involvement - viruses like RSV, influenza and parainfluenza can spread to lower airways. (3) Asthma exacerbation - airway inflammation increases bronchial hyperreactivity. (4) Acute otitis media. (5) Post-viral cough. AOM mechanism in children: Viral URTI causes inflammation and oedema of the Eustachian tube mucosa leading to tube dysfunction and blockage. Negative middle ear pressure develops, effusion accumulates, and bacteria from the nasopharynx ascend through the dysfunctional tube. Children are particularly susceptible because their Eustachian tubes are shorter, more horizontal and more compliant (collapse more easily)."
