## Definition

Chest pain is any uncomfortable sensation — from dull pressure to sharp stabbing — perceived in the anterior or posterior thorax between the diaphragm and the base of the neck. It is one of the most common presenting complaints in both primary care and emergency departments, and the diagnostic challenge lies in the enormous breadth of aetiologies: from immediately life-threatening (acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax) to entirely benign (musculoskeletal strain, psychogenic pain).

The term itself is purely syndromic — it describes a symptom, not a disease. The clinical approach therefore hinges on **rapidly risk-stratifying** the patient to identify "can't-miss" diagnoses while simultaneously building a systematic differential.

> **Chest pain is generally divided into three categories** [1][2]:
> - ***Typical***: chest pain typical of a cardiac origin
> - ***Atypical***: chest pain not typical of a cardiac origin, but cannot be attributed to a certain cause
> - ***Non-cardiac***: chest pain typical of a non-cardiac cause

<Callout title="Why does this classification matter?">
Because the initial categorisation drives pre-test probability for coronary artery disease, which in turn dictates the diagnostic pathway (exercise tolerance test vs CT coronary angiography vs straight to invasive angiography). Getting this wrong wastes resources or — worse — sends a patient with ACS home.

## Epidemiology

### Global and Hong Kong Context

- **Prevalence in primary care**: Chest pain accounts for roughly 1–3% of all primary care consultations and ~5–8% of Emergency Department presentations worldwide.
- **Hong Kong specifics**:
  - Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a leading cause of death in HK (the 3rd commonest cause of death after cancer and pneumonia).
  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) prevalence is rising in HK due to an ageing population, increasing prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, and the historically high smoking rate among men.
  - ***GERD incidence in HK is rising (2.5% in 2002, 3.7% in 2011)*** [3] — an increasingly important cause of non-cardiac chest pain in the local population.
  - Lung cancer is the **2nd commonest cancer in HK by incidence, 1st by mortality** [4] — an important cause of chronic chest pain (especially pleuritic or chest wall involvement).
  - ***In Asian populations, GERD tends to present atypically with increased non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) and acid feeling in the stomach*** [3], meaning you must actively think of GERD in any chest pain workup in HK.

### Age and Sex

- **Young adults (< 35 y)**: Musculoskeletal, psychogenic, and primary spontaneous pneumothorax predominate. ACS is rare but not impossible (consider familial hypercholesterolaemia, cocaine use, Kawasaki disease sequelae).
- **Middle-aged and elderly**: CAD probability rises sharply. Aortic dissection risk increases with age and hypertension. Malignancy-related chest pain becomes more relevant.
- **Sex**: Men have higher pre-test probability for CAD at any given age. Women may present more atypically with "anginal equivalents" (dyspnoea, nausea, fatigue rather than classic crushing chest pain).

## Risk Factors

These are best organised by the aetiology they predispose to, because in the exam and in clinical practice you use risk factors to shift your pre-test probability:

### For Coronary Artery Disease / Acute Coronary Syndrome

| Modifiable | Non-Modifiable |
|---|---|
| ***Abdominal obesity*** | ***Family history of premature CVD*** (1st-degree male < 55 y or female < 65 y) |
| ***Hypertension*** | ***Male sex*** |
| ***Hyperlipidaemia*** (esp. ↑LDL, ↓HDL) | ***Advanced age*** |
| ***Cigarette smoking*** | |
| ***Diabetes mellitus*** | |
| ***Sedentary lifestyle / lack of exercise*** | |
| ***Unhealthy diet*** | |

[1][2]

### For Aortic Dissection

- ***Hypertension (most important risk factor)*** [5]
- ***Connective tissue disorders: Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome*** [5]
- ***Bicuspid aortic valve*** [5]
- ***Aortic aneurysm*** [5]
- ***Family history of aortic dissection*** [5]
- Pregnancy (3rd trimester), cocaine/amphetamine use, previous cardiac surgery, high-intensity weightlifting

### For Pulmonary Embolism

- ***Congenital thrombophilia*** (protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, Factor V Leiden) [6]
- ***Age > 40, smoking, obesity, pregnancy, prolonged immobilisation*** [6]
- ***Solid organ malignancy, antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome*** [6]
- ***OC pills (2–4× risk), HRT*** [6]
- ***Surgery (especially vascular), trauma, varicose veins*** [6]

### For Pneumothorax

- ***Primary spontaneous***: M > F (3–6:1), smoking, tall/thin body habitus, subpleural blebs [7]
- ***Secondary spontaneous***: COPD (50–70%), TB, asthma, CF, lung cancer, Marfan syndrome [7]

### For GERD / Oesophageal Causes

- ***↓LES tone***: hiatus hernia, alcohol, caffeine, smoking, drugs (NSAIDs, CCB, nitrates, anticholinergics) [3]
- ***↑Intra-abdominal pressure***: obesity, pregnancy, chronic cough, constipation [3]

## Anatomy and Function

Understanding the anatomy of the chest is essential because the **source of pain** depends on which structures are involved, and the **pattern of pain referral** depends on their innervation.

### Thoracic Wall Structures
- **Skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles** (pectoralis major/minor, intercostals, serratus anterior): Somatic innervation via intercostal nerves (T1–T12). Pain is well-localised, sharp, reproducible with palpation or movement.
- **Ribs, costochondral junctions, sternum**: Same somatic innervation. Costochondritis (inflammation of costochondral junction) produces a well-localised, reproducible tenderness — the commonest musculoskeletal cause.
- **Thoracic spine and nerve roots**: Compression or inflammation of thoracic nerve roots (e.g., herpes zoster, thoracic disc disease) produces dermatomal pain that may wrap around the chest wall.

### Cardiovascular Structures
- **Heart**: Supplied by coronary arteries (LAD, LCx, RCA). Sensory innervation is via visceral afferent fibres travelling with cardiac sympathetic nerves (T1–T5). This explains why cardiac pain is **poorly localised, diffuse, and referred** to the left arm, jaw, neck, and epigastrium — these areas share the same spinal cord segments (convergence-projection theory of referred pain).
- **Aorta**: The ascending aorta and arch are innervated by vagal and sympathetic afferents. Dissection causes sudden, severe, "tearing" pain because of acute stretching and destruction of the aortic wall media, which is rich in sensory nerve endings.
- **Pericardium**: The parietal pericardium has somatic innervation via the phrenic nerve (C3–C5). This is why pericarditic pain is sharp, pleuritic, and may radiate to the trapezius ridge (the cutaneous territory of C3–C4) — a virtually pathognomonic referral pattern.

### Pulmonary and Pleural Structures
- **Lung parenchyma**: Has **no** somatic sensory innervation. The lung itself does not produce pain. This is why a massive pneumonia can exist with no chest pain until the pleura is involved.
- **Visceral pleura**: Also lacks somatic pain fibres — does not cause pain.
- **Parietal pleura**: Has somatic innervation via intercostal nerves (chest wall portion) and the phrenic nerve (diaphragmatic portion). Inflammation of parietal pleura produces sharp, well-localised pleuritic pain that worsens with breathing. Diaphragmatic pleural irritation refers pain to the ipsilateral shoulder tip (C3–C5 via phrenic nerve).

### Oesophagus and Mediastinal Structures
- **Oesophagus**: Visceral afferents travel alongside cardiac sympathetic fibres at the same spinal cord levels (T1–T5). This is precisely why oesophageal spasm and GERD can **perfectly mimic** angina — the brain literally cannot distinguish the source.
- **Mediastinal lymph nodes and structures**: Enlargement or inflammation can produce a vague, deep pressure sensation.

### Abdominal Structures Referring Pain to Chest
- **Gallbladder** (innervated via right phrenic nerve, C3–C5): Biliary colic can present as right-sided chest pain or right shoulder pain.
- **Stomach/duodenum**: Peptic ulcer disease may present as epigastric/lower chest discomfort.
- **Pancreas**: Pancreatitis may cause epigastric pain radiating to the back, mimicking posterior chest pain.
- **Subphrenic abscess**: Irritates the diaphragm → referred shoulder tip pain.

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl: Why Oesophageal Pain Mimics Cardiac Pain">
The oesophagus and the heart share the same visceral afferent nerve pathways entering the spinal cord at T1–T5. The brain receives signals from both organs at the same dorsal horn neurons and cannot distinguish the origin. This is why GERD and oesophageal spasm can cause crushing, central chest pain that even responds to sublingual GTN (which also relaxes oesophageal smooth muscle). Always consider oesophageal causes in chest pain evaluation.

## Etiology (with Focus on Hong Kong)

The aetiologies of chest pain can be systematically classified by organ system. Below is a comprehensive framework that integrates the probability diagnoses and serious diagnoses from the lecture slides [8].

### Systematic Aetiological Classification

#### A. Cardiovascular Causes

| Aetiology | Pathophysiology | HK Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Stable angina / Chronic coronary syndrome** | Fixed coronary atherosclerotic stenosis → O₂ demand > supply during exertion → myocardial ischaemia → metabolite accumulation (adenosine, lactate, K⁺) → stimulation of cardiac sympathetic nerves → pain [1][2] | Very common; rising prevalence with ageing population and increasing metabolic syndrome |
| **Acute coronary syndrome (UA/NSTEMI/STEMI)** | Acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture/erosion → thrombus formation → dynamic coronary obstruction → ischaemia even at rest → if complete occlusion: transmural infarction (STEMI) [1][2] | Leading cardiovascular cause of death in HK |
| ***Aortic dissection*** | ***Tear in aortic intima → blood enters media → creates false lumen → false lumen dilates, true lumen collapses → end-organ malperfusion*** [5] | Hypertension extremely prevalent in HK elderly population; must always exclude |
| **Pericarditis / Myopericarditis** | Inflammation of pericardium → irritation of phrenic nerve endings in parietal pericardium → sharp, pleuritic pain; if effusion develops → cardiac tamponade | Viral causes common; TB pericarditis important in HK given local TB burden |
| ***Mitral valve prolapse*** | Myxomatous degeneration of mitral valve leaflets → prolapse into LA during systole → may cause atypical chest pain (mechanism unclear; possibly papillary muscle traction or associated autonomic dysfunction) [8] | Often discovered incidentally; included in Murtagh's "pitfalls" |
| **Aortic stenosis** | ↑LV afterload → LV hypertrophy → ↑myocardial O₂ demand with ↓coronary perfusion reserve → subendocardial ischaemia → exertional angina even with normal coronaries | Degenerative AS increasingly common in ageing HK population |
| ***Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP)*** — particularly ***apical HCMP*** | ***↓Vasodilatory reserve → subendocardial ischaemia → chest pain (atypical or typical angina)*** [9]. ***25–30% of HCMP in Japan and HK*** is apical type (vs 1–2% elsewhere) | **Very high yield for HK exams** — disproportionately common in East Asian populations |
| **Pulmonary hypertension** | ***↑RV wall stress → subendocardial hypoperfusion of RV → exertional chest pain*** [6] | Consider in patients with chronic lung disease, recurrent PE, connective tissue diseases |
| **Cardiac tamponade** | Pericardial fluid accumulation → ↑intrapericardial pressure → impaired diastolic filling → ↓cardiac output → shock; pain is from pericardial stretching | TB, malignancy (lung, breast), uraemia, post-MI (Dressler syndrome) |

#### B. Pulmonary and Pleural Causes

| Aetiology | Pathophysiology | HK Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Pulmonary embolism*** | DVT embolises to pulmonary vasculature → V/Q mismatch → hypoxia; if large → acute RV failure → haemodynamic collapse. Pleuritic pain occurs when emboli cause pulmonary infarction → parietal pleural inflammation [6] | Important to consider in post-operative, immobilised, malignancy patients |
| ***Pneumothorax*** | Air enters pleural space → loss of negative intrapleural pressure → lung collapse → sudden pleuritic pain + dyspnoea. ***Tension PTX: one-way valve → progressive air accumulation → mediastinal shift → obstructive shock*** [7] | ***Primary spontaneous***: young, tall, thin males; ***Secondary***: COPD and TB very relevant in HK |
| ***Pneumonia / Pleuritis (pleurisy)*** | Infection → alveolar and pleural inflammation → exudate on parietal pleura → stimulation of intercostal nerves → pleuritic chest pain [8] | Pneumonia is a top cause of death in HK; TB must always be considered |
| **Pleural effusion** | ***Pleuritic chest pain usually ↓ in intensity with ↑effusion size*** (because inflamed pleural surfaces are no longer in contact) [10] | TB pleural effusion is a classic presentation in HK |
| ***Lung cancer*** | Direct chest wall invasion, rib erosion, pleural involvement, nerve compression (brachial plexus in Pancoast tumour), mediastinal infiltration [4] | ***2nd commonest cancer, 1st in mortality in HK*** [4]. In HK females, > 75% are adenocarcinoma and < 40% are smokers [4] |
| ***Mediastinitis*** | Infection/inflammation of mediastinal tissues → deep, severe, poorly localised chest pain + systemic sepsis [8] | Rare but life-threatening; may follow oesophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome) |

#### C. Gastrointestinal Causes

| Aetiology | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD)*** | ***Reflux of gastric acid into oesophagus → mucosal inflammation → visceral afferent stimulation at T1–T5 → retrosternal burning/non-cardiac chest pain*** [3]. ***In Asians: atypical presentation with ↑NCCP*** [3] |
| ***Oesophageal spasm (diffuse oesophageal spasm)*** | ***Simultaneous contractions of circular muscle of oesophageal body → episodic chest pain that may mimic angina*** [11]. Responds to nitrates (smooth muscle relaxant) — a diagnostic pitfall |
| ***Peptic ulcer disease*** | ***Imbalance between aggressive factors (acid, pepsin) > protective mechanisms (mucus, bicarbonate, prostaglandins, mucosal blood flow) → mucosal erosion → visceral pain*** [12]. Epigastric pain may be perceived as lower chest pain |
| ***Biliary colic*** | Gallstone impaction in cystic duct → gallbladder spasm → visceral pain referred to epigastrium/right upper quadrant/right chest/right shoulder (phrenic nerve pathway) [8] |
| **Oesophagitis / oesophageal ulceration** | Direct mucosal damage (acid, medications like bisphosphonates, infections in immunocompromised) → odynophagia and chest pain |
| ***Oesophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome)*** | Transmural tear (usually from forceful vomiting) → mediastinal contamination → mediastinitis + subcutaneous emphysema → severe chest pain + systemic sepsis |

#### D. Musculoskeletal Causes

| Aetiology | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Musculoskeletal chest wall pain (including costochondritis)*** | Inflammation of costochondral junctions (Tietze syndrome if swelling present) or intercostal muscle strain → somatic pain via intercostal nerves → sharp, well-localised, reproducible on palpation/movement [8] |
| Rib fracture | Trauma or pathological fracture (osteoporosis, metastasis) → periosteal inflammation → localised sharp pain worsened by breathing and movement |
| Thoracic spine pathology | Degenerative disc disease, vertebral compression fracture, nerve root compression → radicular pain wrapping around the chest wall in a dermatomal distribution |

#### E. Neurological / Dermatological Causes

| Aetiology | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Herpes zoster (shingles)*** | Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in dorsal root ganglion → vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. **Pre-eruptive phase** (pain before rash appears) can perfectly mimic other causes of chest pain for 2–3 days [8] |
| Intercostal neuralgia | Compression or irritation of intercostal nerves (post-herpetic, post-thoracotomy, tumour infiltration) → burning, shooting pain along affected dermatome |

#### F. Psychogenic Causes

| Aetiology | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Psychogenic: stress, anxiety, depression (accounts for ~10% of chest pain presentations)*** [8] | Autonomic hyperarousal → hyperventilation → respiratory alkalosis → coronary and peripheral vasoconstriction + muscle tension → chest tightness and paraesthesia. Also heightened visceral and somatic pain sensitivity (central sensitisation) |
| ***Panic disorder*** | ***Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks with abrupt surge of intense fear + autonomic symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, dyspnoea, diaphoresis)*** [13]. Somatic symptoms may prompt help-seeking → frequently presents to ED as "chest pain" |
| ***Somatic symptom disorder*** | ***Chest pain as one of multiple somatic symptoms with excessive thoughts/worries/behaviours related to the symptoms*** [14]. ***High health care utilisation, doctor-shopping, repeated negative workups*** [14] |

#### G. Other / Rare Causes

| Aetiology | Notes |
|---|---|
| ***Bornholm disease (epidemic pleurodynia)*** | ***Coxsackievirus B infection → inflammation of intercostal muscles/pleura → sudden, severe, paroxysmal chest/abdominal pain ("devil's grip") + fever*** [8] |
| ***Tumours of spinal cord and meninges*** | ***Can cause thoracic radicular pain*** [8] |
| Aortic aneurysm (without dissection) | ***Compression of surrounding structures (e.g., RLN compression → hoarseness by thoracic aortic aneurysm)*** [15]. Pain from stretching of aneurysm sac → ***indicates impending rupture*** [15] |
| Cocaine/amphetamine-induced chest pain | Direct coronary vasospasm + accelerated atherosclerosis + ↑myocardial O₂ demand (due to ↑HR, ↑BP from sympathomimetic effects) |

## Classification

Chest pain can be classified in several clinically useful ways:

### 1. By Acuity

| Acute Chest Pain | Stable / Chronic Chest Pain |
|---|---|
| ACS, aortic dissection, PE, tension PTX, tamponade, Boerhaave | Stable angina, GERD, musculoskeletal, malignancy, psychogenic |

### 2. By Character of Pain

| Cardiac (Ischaemic) | Pleuritic | Musculoskeletal | Oesophageal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dull, constricting, squeezing | Sharp, stabbing, worse with inspiration | Sharp, localised, reproducible on palpation | Burning, retrosternal, related to swallowing/posture |

### 3. By Organ System

(As detailed in the Etiology section above: Cardiovascular, Pulmonary, GI, Musculoskeletal, Neurological, Psychogenic)

### 4. By Risk Stratification (from Lecture Slides and Senior Notes)

***Acute Chest Pain*** [1][2]:

| ***Potentially severe or life-threatening*** | ***Relatively benign causes*** |
|---|---|
| ***Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)*** | ***Episode of stable angina*** |

|---|---|
| ***Stable ischaemic heart disease*** | ***GERD and other oesophageal pathologies*** |
| ***Subacute/chronic pulmonary embolism*** | ***Musculoskeletal pain*** |
| ***Malignancy with pleural/chest wall involvement*** | ***Psychogenic chest pain*** |

### 5. Murtagh's Classification of Chest Pain in Adults (From Lecture Slides) [8]

> ***Probability diagnosis:***
> - ***Musculoskeletal (chest wall) including costochondritis***
> - ***Psychogenic***
> - ***Angina***

> - ***Cardiovascular: myocardial infarction / unstable angina, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism / infarction***
> - ***Neoplasia/cancer: lung cancer, tumours of spinal cord and meninges***
> - ***Infection: pneumonia / pleuritis (pleurisy), mediastinitis, pericarditis, myocarditis***
> - ***Pneumothorax***
>
> ***Pitfalls (often missed):***

>
> ***Is the patient trying to tell me something?***
> - ***Psychogenic: stress, anxiety, depression (10%)***

### 6. Classification of Angina (ESC/AHA)

| Feature | Typical Angina (all 3 present) | Atypical Angina (2 of 3) | Non-anginal Chest Pain (≤1 of 3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Constricting discomfort in chest/jaw/shoulder/arm | ✓ | ± | ± |
| Provoked by exertion or emotional stress | ✓ | ± | ± |
| Relieved by rest and/or GTN within 5 min | ✓ | ± | ± |

### 7. Classification of Aortic Dissection

**Stanford Classification** (simpler, more clinically used):
- **Type A**: Involves the ascending aorta (regardless of origin) → **surgical emergency**
- **Type B**: Does NOT involve the ascending aorta → **medical management** unless complicated

**DeBakey Classification**:
- Type I: Originates in ascending aorta, propagates to arch and descending
- Type II: Originates and confined to ascending aorta
- Type III: Originates in descending aorta (IIIa: descending thoracic only; IIIb: extends to abdominal)

***Acute aortic syndrome encompasses*** [5]:
- ***Classical aortic dissection (AD)***: separation of aortic wall layers due to intimal tear
- ***Aortic intramural hematoma (5–20%)***: focal hematoma between intima and media due to ***spontaneous rupture of vasa vasorum in the ABSENCE of a detectable intimal tear***
- ***Penetrating aortic ulcers***: ulcers penetrating into adventitia, ***typically associated with atherosclerotic changes and smoking***
- ***Limited intimal tear without hematoma***

## Clinical Features

The clinical features are best understood when linked to the underlying pathophysiology. Below is a comprehensive system-by-system breakdown of symptoms and signs.

### A. Symptoms

The OPQRST mnemonic (Onset, Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Region/Radiation, Severity, Timing) is the framework for characterising chest pain.

#### Cardiac Ischaemic Pain (Angina / ACS)

| OPQRST | Feature | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Onset** | ***ACS: typically takes minutes to develop, may occur at rest or with exertion*** [1][2] | Acute plaque rupture → thrombus → dynamic obstruction → ischaemia at rest |
| | ***Stable angina: builds up gradually in proportion to intensity of exertion*** [1][2] | Fixed stenosis → O₂ demand exceeds supply only during exertion |
| **Provocation** | Exertion, emotional stress, cold weather, heavy meals | All increase myocardial O₂ demand (↑HR, ↑BP, ↑contractility) against a fixed stenosis |
| **Palliation** | Rest (stable angina), sublingual GTN within 5 min | Rest ↓O₂ demand; GTN causes venodilation (↓preload → ↓wall stress → ↓O₂ demand) and coronary vasodilation |
| **Quality** | ***Typically dull, constricting, choking, 'heavy'. Described as squeezing, crushing, burning, aching or even as breathlessness*** [1][2] | Visceral afferent fibres from the heart produce a diffuse, poorly localised sensation (unlike somatic pain) |
| | ***Levine's sign: characteristic gesture of a clenched fist on chest when describing angina*** [1][2] | Reflects the constricting, diffuse nature of the pain — patients cannot point with one finger |
| | ***Patients often emphasise it is a discomfort, not a pain*** [1][2] | |
| **Region/Radiation** | Retrosternal, radiating to left arm, shoulder, jaw, neck, epigastrium | Cardiac visceral afferents enter spinal cord at T1–T5, converging with somatic afferents from these dermatomes |
| **Severity** | Variable; ACS typically more severe and prolonged than stable angina | Degree of ischaemia correlates with severity. Complete occlusion → maximal ischaemia |
| **Timing** | Stable: < 30 min, predictable with exertion. ACS: > 20 min, at rest, crescendo pattern | Stable: ischaemia resolves with rest. ACS: persistent obstruction → prolonged ischaemia → risk of infarction |

**Associated symptoms in ACS**:
- **Diaphoresis** (autonomic activation → sympathetic discharge → sweating)
- **Nausea/vomiting** (vagal stimulation, especially in inferior MI via proximity of diaphragmatic surface to vagal fibres)
- **Dyspnoea** (LV dysfunction → ↑LV filling pressures → pulmonary congestion)
- **Sense of impending doom** (massive sympathetic discharge)
- **Syncope** (↓cardiac output from arrhythmia or massive MI)

<Callout title="Exam Tip: Anginal Equivalents" type="error">
Elderly, diabetics (autonomic neuropathy), and women may present WITHOUT classic chest pain. Instead, they present with "anginal equivalents" — isolated dyspnoea, diaphoresis, nausea, fatigue, or syncope. A high index of suspicion is required.
</Callout>

#### Aortic Dissection Pain

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Onset*** | ***Abrupt onset*** [5] | Sudden intimal tear → immediate mechanical disruption |
| ***Quality*** | ***Sharp, tearing, knife-like*** [5] | Longitudinal shearing force as blood enters the aortic media |
| ***Site*** | ***Anterior chest (Type A) / Back or abdomen (Type B)*** [5] | Type A involves ascending aorta (anterior mediastinum); Type B involves descending aorta (posterior mediastinum/abdomen) |
| ***Radiation*** | ***Radiates anywhere in thorax or abdomen*** [5] | Dissection can propagate along the entire aortic length, and pain migrates with it — "migratory pain" is classic |
| ***Maximum at onset*** | ***Sudden onset, maximum at onset*** [1][2] | Unlike ACS which builds up, dissection pain is maximal immediately because the mechanical disruption is instantaneous |

**Associated features of aortic dissection** [5]:
- ***Pulse deficit***: weak or absent carotid, brachial, or femoral pulse — due to ***intimal flap obstructing branch vessel ostia or compression by expanding false lumen hematoma***
- ***Blood pressure discrepancy***: > 20 mmHg difference between arms (same mechanism as pulse deficit)
- ***Hypertension*** (***Type A: 25–35%; Type B: 70%***) — often the underlying cause and still present at presentation
- ***Hypotension*** (***Type A: 25%; Type B: 5%***) and syncope — due to:
  - ***Aortic regurgitation***
  - ***Cardiac tamponade*** (blood leaks into pericardial space)
  - ***Acute myocardial infarction*** (dissection extends into coronary ostia)
  - ***Hemothorax or hemoperitoneum*** (aortic rupture into pleural/peritoneal cavity)
- ***Early diastolic decrescendo murmur with wide pulse pressure*** → ***aortic regurgitation*** [5] (dissection disrupts aortic root geometry, preventing leaflet coaptation)
- ***Focal neurological deficits*** [5] due to:
  - ***Paraplegia*** (spinal cord — artery of Adamkiewicz compromised)
  - ***Altered level of consciousness*** (carotid artery involvement)
  - ***Horner's syndrome*** (superior cervical ganglion compression)
  - ***Hoarseness*** (left recurrent laryngeal nerve compression)

#### Pleuritic Chest Pain (PE, Pneumothorax, Pneumonia, Pleurisy)

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Quality | ***Sharp, stabbing, pricking, knife-like*** [1][2] | Somatic pain from inflamed parietal pleura via intercostal nerves — well-localised |
| Provocation | ***↑ with inspiration*** [1][2] | Inspiration expands the lung → inflamed parietal and visceral pleura rub against each other → pain |
| Site | Usually lateral, well-localised to area of pathology | Parietal pleura has precise somatotopic innervation |
| Radiation | Ipsilateral shoulder tip if diaphragmatic pleura involved | Phrenic nerve (C3–C5) innervates diaphragmatic pleura → pain referred to shoulder tip (same dermatome) |

**Specific features by cause**:

**Pulmonary Embolism** [6]:
- ***Acute onset pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, haemoptysis (occurs late with infarction)*** if small/medium PE
- ***Collapse/syncope, crushing central chest pain, shock, sudden death*** if massive PE
- ***Sinus tachycardia on ECG with right heart strain pattern (RBBB, S1Q3T3)*** if massive [6]
- **Why crushing central chest pain in massive PE?** → Acute RV dilatation → RV ischaemia (↑wall stress, ↓coronary perfusion) → mimics ACS

**Pneumothorax** [7]:
- ***Sudden onset unilateral pleuritic chest pain + SOB***
- ***Generally does not correlate with size*** (a small pneumothorax can be very painful)
- ***Disproportionately severe in SSP*** (less respiratory reserve)

**Pneumonia/Pleurisy**:
- Pleuritic pain + productive cough + fever + dyspnoea
- Pain indicates involvement of parietal pleura (the lung parenchyma itself is insensate)

#### Pericarditic Pain

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Quality | Sharp, stabbing | Somatic pain from inflamed parietal pericardium via phrenic nerve |
| Provocation | Worse lying flat, better sitting forward/leaning forward | Lying flat → heart falls back onto inflamed posterior pericardium → ↑contact → ↑pain. Sitting forward → heart falls away from pericardium → ↓contact |
| Radiation | **Trapezius ridge** (virtually pathognomonic) | Phrenic nerve (C3–C5) innervates parietal pericardium; trapezius ridge is in C3–C4 dermatome |
| Associated | Fever, preceding viral illness, friction rub on auscultation | Viral pericarditis is commonest cause; friction rub = inflamed pericardial surfaces rubbing |

#### Oesophageal / GERD Pain

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Quality | ***Retrosternal burning*** [1][2] | Acid contact with oesophageal squamous epithelium → chemical mucosal injury → visceral afferent stimulation |
| Provocation | ***Posturally aggravated: bending, stooping, lying flat*** [3] | These positions ↑gravitational reflux of gastric acid through an incompetent LES |
| Palliation | Antacids, PPI, sitting upright | Neutralise acid or reduce production; upright position uses gravity to ↓reflux |
| Associated | ***Heartburn, acid regurgitation, water brash (reflex salivary gland stimulation as acid enters throat)*** [3] | Refluxate irritates oesophageal and pharyngeal mucosa |
| Mimicry | ***Non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) — can perfectly mimic angina*** [3] | Shared T1–T5 visceral afferents with heart |

***Diffuse oesophageal spasm*** [11]:
- ***Episodic chest pain that may mimic angina***
- ***Sometimes associated with transient dysphagia***
- ***Usually in late middle age***

#### Musculoskeletal Pain

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Quality | Sharp, well-localised | Somatic pain via intercostal nerves — precisely localised |
| Provocation | ***Pain after exertion, with movement, palpation*** [1][2] | Mechanical stress on inflamed costochondral junctions, muscles, or periosteum |
| Palliation | Rest, NSAIDs, avoiding provoking movements | Reduces mechanical stress and inflammation |
| Duration | Often persistent (hours to days), positional | Unlike cardiac pain which is typically < 30 min |
| Reproducibility | Tenderness reproducible on palpation | Key distinguishing feature from cardiac pain — visceral pain is NOT reproducible on palpation |

#### Psychogenic Chest Pain

| Feature | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Quality | Variable — can be sharp, dull, pressure-like | Not linked to a single structural mechanism; involves central pain processing abnormalities, hypervigilance |
| Context | ***Stress, anxiety, depression*** [8] | Autonomic hyperarousal, hyperventilation, muscle tension |
| Associated | Sighing, hyperventilation, perioral/digital paraesthesia, palpitations | Hyperventilation → ↓PaCO₂ → respiratory alkalosis → ↓ionised calcium → neuromuscular excitability → paraesthesia and tetany |
| Duration | Often prolonged (hours), vague location | |
| ***Panic disorder*** | ***Recurrent unexpected panic attacks with autonomic symptoms*** [13] | ***Abrupt surge of intense fear → cognitive and autonomic cascade*** |

<Callout title="Exam Pearl: Features Against Cardiac Chest Pain">
The following features argue AGAINST a cardiac cause:
- Pain that is sharp, stabbing, or knife-like (unless pericarditis)
- Pain reproducible by palpation of the chest wall
- Pain lasting < 30 seconds or continuously for days
- Pain that varies with position (unless pericarditis)
- Pain localised to a fingertip-sized area
- Pain that occurs AFTER (not during) exertion

However, remember that atypical presentations of ACS do exist — never completely exclude ACS based on character alone in a high-risk patient.

### B. Signs

Physical examination findings should be linked back to the suspected pathology:

#### General Inspection
- **Distress level**: Writhing (renal/biliary colic), lying completely still (peritonitis/perforated ulcer), sitting forward (pericarditis), clutching chest (ACS)
- **Pallor**: Anaemia (may exacerbate angina), shock (massive PE, dissection, tamponade)
- **Diaphoresis**: Sympathetic activation (ACS, massive PE, tension PTX)
- **Cyanosis**: Hypoxaemia (massive PE, tension PTX, pneumonia)
- ***Marfanoid habitus***: tall, long limbs, arachnodactyly, high-arched palate — think aortic dissection, pneumothorax

#### Vital Signs
- **Tachycardia**: Non-specific — stress response, hypovolaemia, PE, pain, anxiety, tension PTX
- **Hypotension**: Cardiogenic shock (massive MI), obstructive shock (massive PE, tension PTX, tamponade), aortic rupture
- ***BP discrepancy between arms > 20 mmHg***: Strongly suggests aortic dissection (false lumen compressing subclavian)
- **Fever**: Pneumonia, pericarditis, myocarditis, mediastinitis
- **Pulsus paradoxus** (> 10 mmHg ↓SBP on inspiration): Cardiac tamponade (↑intrapericardial pressure impairs RV filling preferentially during inspiration)

#### Cardiovascular Examination
- ***Xanthomas, xanthelasma, arcus senilis***: Hyperlipidaemia → CAD risk factor [1][2]
- ***Displaced, dyskinetic apex beat***: LV dysfunction/dilatation (post-MI, DCMP)
- ***Gallop rhythm (S3)***: LV volume overload/failure — rapid ventricular filling into a dilated, non-compliant LV [1][2]
- ***S4 (atrial gallop)***: ↓LV compliance (LVH, acute ischaemia) — atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle
- ***Cardiac murmurs***: AS (ejection systolic, radiates to carotids), AR (early diastolic), MR (pansystolic, radiates to axilla), MVP (mid-systolic click + late systolic murmur)
- ***Early diastolic decrescendo murmur with wide pulse pressure***: Aortic regurgitation in aortic dissection [5]
- **Pericardial friction rub**: Scratchy, superficial, 3-component sound (atrial systole, ventricular systole, ventricular diastole) — pathognomonic of pericarditis
- **Muffled heart sounds + distended neck veins + hypotension** (Beck's triad): Cardiac tamponade
- ***Carotid bruits, signs of peripheral vascular disease, absent peripheral pulses***: Co-existent atherosclerotic disease [1][2]

#### Respiratory Examination
- ***↓/Absent breath sounds + hyperresonant percussion***: Pneumothorax [7]
- **Bronchial breathing, crepitations, dullness to percussion**: Consolidation (pneumonia)
- **Stony dull percussion + ↓breath sounds + ↓vocal resonance**: Pleural effusion
- ***Tracheal deviation***: Tension pneumothorax (away from affected side), massive pleural effusion (away), lung collapse (towards)
- **Subcutaneous emphysema** (crepitus on palpation): Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, oesophageal perforation

#### Chest Wall Examination
- **Reproducible tenderness on palpation**: Musculoskeletal cause (costochondritis, rib fracture)
- **Visible swelling at costochondral junction**: Tietze syndrome (costochondritis with visible swelling)
- **Dermatomal vesicular rash**: Herpes zoster

#### Abdominal Examination
- **Epigastric tenderness**: PUD, pancreatitis, gastritis
- **Right upper quadrant tenderness + Murphy's sign**: Biliary pathology
- **Distended, board-like abdomen**: Perforated viscus

<Callout title="Red Flags in Chest Pain Examination" type="error">
The following findings demand immediate action:
- **Hypotension + distended neck veins**: Think tamponade or tension PTX
- **Unequal pulses/BP between arms**: Think aortic dissection
- **Absent breath sounds + hyperresonance + tracheal deviation**: Think tension PTX → needle decompression BEFORE CXR
- **New murmur of AR + tearing chest pain**: Think aortic dissection → CT aortography urgently
- **Haemodynamic instability + acute chest pain**: ACS, massive PE, tension PTX, tamponade, ruptured aortic aneurysm
</Callout>

## Relevant Pathophysiology Deep Dives

### Why Does Myocardial Ischaemia Cause Pain?

1. Coronary stenosis or spasm → ↓O₂ delivery to myocardium
2. O₂ supply < demand → anaerobic metabolism
3. Accumulation of metabolites: **adenosine**, lactate, K⁺, bradykinin, histamine
4. These metabolites stimulate **cardiac sympathetic afferent nerve endings** (unmyelinated C-fibres)
5. Afferent signals travel via sympathetic chain → dorsal root ganglia T1–T5 → dorsal horn of spinal cord
6. **Convergence-projection**: These visceral afferents converge on the same second-order neurons that receive somatic afferents from the chest wall, left arm, shoulder, jaw
7. The brain misinterprets the signal as originating from these somatic structures → **referred pain**

This explains why:
- Pain is poorly localised and diffuse
- It radiates to the left arm, shoulder, jaw, neck
- Patients use the whole hand (Levine's sign) rather than pointing with one finger

### Why Does Aortic Dissection Cause "Tearing" Pain?

The aortic media is rich in **vasa vasorum** and sensory nerve endings. When an intimal tear occurs:
1. Blood under **high arterial pressure** forces its way into the media
2. This physically **shears** the layers apart longitudinally
3. The tearing of collagen and elastic fibres in the media directly stimulates nociceptors
4. The **instantaneous** nature of mechanical disruption explains why pain is **maximal at onset** (unlike ACS which builds up as ischaemia worsens)
5. As dissection **propagates**, pain **migrates** — this is a classic and discriminating feature

### Why Does PE Cause Different Types of Pain?

- **Small/medium PE**: Pulmonary infarction → localised inflammation of parietal pleura → **pleuritic pain** (sharp, worse with breathing)
- **Massive PE**: Acute RV dilatation → RV wall tension ↑ markedly → subendocardial ischaemia of RV → **crushing central chest pain mimicking ACS**. Additionally, ↓CO → systemic hypoperfusion → syncope/shock.

### Why Does Pericarditis Pain Improve with Sitting Forward?

- The parietal pericardium is innervated by the **phrenic nerve** (C3–C5)
- In pericarditis, the inflamed parietal and visceral pericardial layers rub against each other
- **Lying flat**: The heart rests against the posterior pericardium → maximum contact between inflamed surfaces → maximum pain
- **Sitting forward**: Gravity pulls the heart anteriorly and away from the posterior pericardium → reduces contact → reduces pain
- **Trapezius ridge radiation**: Phrenic nerve C3–C4 territory includes the trapezius ridge

## Chest Pain in Children [8]

***Key points from lecture slides*** [8]:
- ***Key history***: usual features of pain including aggravating and relieving factors (movement, exercise, rest, swallowing, breathing, eating). ***Note associated symptoms (fever, cough, dizziness, overexertion, syncope, recent viral illness). Family history especially cardiac disease including unexplained sudden death.***
- ***Key examination***: ***Vital signs especially pulse (including nature) and temperature. Palpation of chest wall. Basic cardiovascular and respiratory examination.***
- ***Key investigations***: ***No investigation usually required. Consider ECG and CXR.***
- ***Diagnostic tips***:
  - ***Most cases of chest pain in children are of unknown aetiology and probably psychogenic***
  - ***Chest pain is more common in adolescents***
  - ***Less than 5% of cases are caused by cardiac disease***
  - ***Myocardial ischaemia is rare in children but consider it in any child with exercise-induced pain, adolescents with longstanding diabetes, and children with sickle cell anaemia***

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: Chest pain is a syndromic complaint categorised into typical cardiac, atypical, or non-cardiac based on clinical features.

**Big Six Life-Threatening Causes**: ACS, aortic dissection, PE, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, oesophageal rupture.

**Murtagh's Framework**: Probability diagnoses (musculoskeletal, psychogenic, angina); Serious (MI/UA, dissection, PE, pneumonia, PTX, pericarditis, cancer); Pitfalls (MVP, oesophageal spasm, GERD, biliary colic, PUD); Psychogenic (10%).

**Angina Features**: Dull/constricting/squeezing, retrosternal, provoked by exertion, relieved by rest/GTN < 5 min, Levine's sign. ACS = pain at rest, > 20 min.

**Aortic Dissection**: Abrupt onset, maximal at onset, tearing/knife-like, anterior (Type A) or back (Type B), migratory. Pulse deficit, BP discrepancy, AR murmur. HT is the most important RF.

**PE**: Pleuritic chest pain + dyspnoea ± haemoptysis (small/medium); syncope + shock + crushing chest pain (massive). S1Q3T3 on ECG.

**Pneumothorax**: Sudden pleuritic pain + SOB. Tension PTX = clinical diagnosis + obstructive shock → needle decompression first.

**GERD/Oesophageal**: Retrosternal burning, postural aggravation, mimics angina (shared T1–T5 afferents). Asian presentation atypical with ↑NCCP.

**Pericarditis**: Sharp, worse lying flat, better sitting forward, trapezius ridge radiation, friction rub.

**Apical HCMP**: 25–30% of HCMP in HK/Japan — angina from ↓vasodilatory reserve, giant T-wave inversion on ECG.

**Key Exam Signs**: BP discrepancy (dissection), pulsus paradoxus (tamponade), absent breath sounds + hyperresonance (PTX), reproducible tenderness (musculoskeletal), dermatomal rash (zoster).

**Children**: Most chest pain is benign/psychogenic; < 5% cardiac; consider ischaemia if exercise-induced, longstanding DM, or sickle cell disease.

      question: "A 62-year-old man presents with sudden-onset severe chest pain that is maximal at onset and radiates to the back. His right arm BP is 180/100 and left arm BP is 140/90. What is the most likely diagnosis, and explain the pathophysiology of the BP discrepancy?",
      markscheme: "Aortic dissection (likely Type A or Type B involving left subclavian). BP discrepancy is due to the dissection flap extending into the subclavian artery origin, with the false lumen compressing or obstructing blood flow to one arm. Alternatively, the intimal flap covers the branch vessel ostium."

      question: "Why can oesophageal spasm and GERD perfectly mimic angina? Explain the neuroanatomical basis.",
      markscheme: "The oesophagus and the heart share visceral afferent nerve pathways entering the spinal cord at T1-T5. Convergence-projection occurs at the dorsal horn where visceral afferents from both organs synapse on the same second-order neurons. The brain cannot distinguish the source. Additionally, both respond to GTN (smooth muscle relaxant) which further confounds the picture."

Serious disorders not to be missed (e.g. MI, aortic dissection, PE, pneumothorax, pneumonia, pericarditis, lung cancer). 3. Pitfalls often missed (e.g. MVP, oesophageal spasm, GERD, biliary colic, peptic ulcer). 4. Rarities (e.g. Bornholm disease, oesophagitis). 5. Is the patient trying to tell me something?

      markscheme: "Apical HCMP accounts for 25-30% of all HCMP in HK and Japan (vs only 1-2% in the West). It has a more benign prognosis. ECG shows giant T-wave inversion in precordial leads. Echo/cardiac MRI shows spade-like configuration in end-diastole and obliteration of distal cavity in systole."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why pericarditic chest pain improves when the patient sits forward and may radiate to the trapezius ridge.",
      markscheme: "Sitting forward: gravity pulls the heart anteriorly, reducing contact between inflamed parietal and visceral pericardial surfaces, thus reducing friction and pain. Lying flat increases contact. Trapezius ridge radiation: the parietal pericardium is innervated by the phrenic nerve (C3-C5), and the trapezius ridge lies within the C3-C4 dermatome, hence referred pain via the convergence-projection mechanism."

      question: "A patient presents with acute pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea. Examination shows absent breath sounds and hyperresonance on the left, with tracheal deviation to the right and hypotension. What is the diagnosis and what is the immediate management?",
      markscheme: "Tension pneumothorax. It is a clinical diagnosis (do NOT wait for CXR). Immediate management is needle decompression: insert a large-bore cannula (14-16G) into the 2nd intercostal space, mid-clavicular line on the affected (left) side, followed by chest drain insertion. The pathophysiology is a one-way valve causing progressive air accumulation, mediastinal shift compressing the contralateral lung and impairing venous return, leading to obstructive shock."
