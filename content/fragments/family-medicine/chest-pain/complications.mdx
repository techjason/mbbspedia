## Complications of Chest Pain Aetiologies

This section addresses the major complications arising from the life-threatening and common causes of chest pain. Understanding complications requires thinking about them as **the downstream consequences of the underlying pathophysiology** — each complication is not a random event but a predictable extension of the disease process.

---

### 1. Complications of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) / Myocardial Infarction

MI complications are the single highest-yield topic in this category. They can be organised by timing and mechanism.

#### A. Arrhythmias (Most Common Early Complication)

Why? Infarcted myocardium is **electrically unstable** — the border zone between dead and viable tissue creates regions of heterogeneous refractoriness, re-entry circuits, and abnormal automaticity. Additionally, acidosis in ischaemic tissue causes K⁺ efflux and Ca²⁺ influx, further destabilising membrane potential [1].

| Arrhythmia | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ventricular fibrillation (VF)** | Re-entry circuits at border zone of infarct; acidotic tissue with K⁺/Ca²⁺ derangement | **Commonest cause of death in the first hour** of MI. Prompt defibrillation is life-saving [1] |
| **Ventricular tachycardia (VT)** | Same re-entrant mechanisms; can degenerate to VF | Sustained monomorphic VT → amiodarone or cardioversion if unstable [1] |
| **AF / Atrial flutter** | ***Common and frequently transient; can be a sign of impending or overt LVF*** [1] | Atrial distension from ↑LA pressure (due to LV failure) → triggers AF |
| **Sinus bradycardia** | Vagal stimulation (especially in ***inferior MI***, where the diaphragmatic surface is close to vagal fibres) | Atropine if symptomatic; pacing if refractory [1] |
| ***AV block*** | ***1° or Mobitz I: conservative*** [1] — usually reflects vagal tone (inferior MI) and is reversible. ***Mobitz II or complete HB: pacing*** [1] — reflects structural damage to His-Purkinje system (anterior MI) and may be permanent | Anterior MI with high-degree AV block has worse prognosis because it implies extensive septal necrosis |
| **PSVT** | Re-entry involving AV node | ***Cardioversion if haemodynamic compromise; ATP then verapamil*** [1] |

#### B. Pump Failure (Heart Failure / Cardiogenic Shock)

***Mechanism: downward spiral exacerbating myocardial ischaemia*** [1]:
- ***↓Systolic function → ↓coronary perfusion → ↓supply → more ischaemia***
- ***↓Diastolic function → ↑pulmonary congestion → hypoxaemia → more ischaemia***

***Indicates extensive myocardial damage → poor prognosis*** [1].

| Manifestation | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***LV dysfunction (95%)*** | Loss of contractile myocardium → ↓EF → ↑LVEDP → pulmonary oedema | ***Vasodilators (esp ACEI) if BP stable; inotropes (dopamine then dobutamine) if ↓BP; IABP with view for catheterisation ± revascularisation*** [1] |
| ***RV dysfunction (5%)*** | ***Usually occurs in inferior MI*** [1]; RV infarction → ↓RV output → underfilling of LV → ↓CO **without** pulmonary oedema | ***Volume expansion with colloids/crystalloids*** [1] (the RV needs more preload to push blood through). ***Bedside echo shows non-compressible IVC*** [1]. **Avoid diuretics and vasodilators** as they reduce preload further |
| **Cardiogenic shock** | Loss of > 40% of LV myocardium; or acute mechanical complication | Inotropes + IABP + urgent revascularisation; consider mechanical circulatory support (Impella, ECMO) |

<Callout title="Why RV Infarction Is Managed with Fluids, Not Diuretics" type="error">
In RV infarction, the failing RV cannot pump blood into the pulmonary circulation → LV is under-filled. The patient appears "dry" on the left side (no pulmonary oedema) but "wet" on the right (↑JVP). Giving diuretics or nitrates would reduce preload to the already struggling RV → worsening of shock. Instead, IV fluids expand the RV preload, helping it push blood forward. This is a classic exam trap.
</Callout>

#### C. Pericardial Complications

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism | Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***Peri-infarction pericarditis (PIP)*** | ***Common on 2nd/3rd day post-MI; 1.2% of MI patients*** [1] | Direct inflammation of pericardium overlying the infarcted myocardium (transmural MI extends to epicardium → irritates adjacent pericardium) | ***Development of a different pain: positional, sharp pleuritic, esp at trapezius ridge; pericardial rub (diagnostic)*** [1]; ***ECG: widespread ST↑ or PR↓ beyond anatomic boundary*** [1] | ***Paracetamol ± aspirin (650 mg Q6–8h) ± opiate analgesia; avoid NSAIDs/steroids 7–10 days after acute MI due to ↑risk of aneurysm/rupture*** [1] |
| ***Post-MI pericardial effusion*** | ***Common, ~1/3 of acute STEMI*** [1] | Blood/inflammatory fluid seeps into pericardial space from transmural necrosis | ***Usually asymptomatic, detected incidentally*** [1] | ***None unless tamponade → drainage*** [1] |
| ***Post cardiac injury (Dressler) syndrome*** | ***Weeks to months post-MI*** [1] | ***Probably autoimmunity due to release of cardiac antigens into pericardial space*** [1] — exposed intracellular proteins trigger immune response | ***Persistent fever, pericarditis, pleurisy; ↑WCC, CRP/ESR; pericardial ± pleural effusion*** [1] | ***High-dose aspirin/NSAID (indomethacin 25–50 mg TDS × 1–2d), colchicine ± steroid*** [1] |

#### D. Mechanical Complications

These are devastating complications caused by structural failure of necrotic myocardium. They typically occur when softened, necrotic tissue cannot withstand ventricular pressure.

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism | Presentation | Management |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***IV septal rupture*** | ***~24h from MI (up to 2 weeks); ~0.1% of MI*** [1] | ***Usually complicates anterior MI (LAD); rupture occurs at margin of necrotic and non-necrotic myocardium*** [1] → blood shunts from LV to RV through defect | ***Sudden haemodynamic deterioration + new pansystolic murmur (to RLSB)*** [1]; ***usually develops RV failure (d/dx LVF with APO in acute MR)*** [1] | ***Observe with delayed surgery if stable; emergency cardiac catheterisation + repair if unstable*** [1] |
| ***LV free wall rupture*** | ***50% occurs ≤ 5 days; > 90% ≤ 2 weeks; < 1%*** [1] | Complete transmural necrosis → ventricular wall cannot withstand systolic pressure → tears | ***Complete rupture → blood pumps into pericardial cavity → cardiac tamponade → sudden Rt HF + shock → PEA and death*** [1]. ***Incomplete rupture → sealed by pericardium and thrombus → persistent/recurrent pleuritic chest pain*** [1] | ***Emergency percutaneous pericardiocentesis → surgical repair*** [1] |
| **Acute papillary muscle rupture → acute MR** | Days 2–7 post-MI | Papillary muscle necrosis (especially posteromedial papillary muscle in inferior MI, which has single blood supply from PDA) → rupture → flail mitral leaflet → severe acute MR | Sudden pulmonary oedema + new loud pansystolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla; haemodynamic collapse. D/dx: VSD (murmur at RLSB with RV failure rather than LV failure) | Emergency surgical MV repair/replacement ± IABP stabilisation |

<Callout title="How to Distinguish New Murmurs Post-MI: VSD vs Acute MR">
Both present with sudden haemodynamic deterioration and a new pansystolic murmur. The key distinction:
- **VSD**: Murmur loudest at **left sternal border**; causes **RV failure** (L→R shunt overloads RV); step-up in O₂ saturation in RV on catheterisation
- **Acute MR**: Murmur loudest at **apex radiating to axilla**; causes **LV failure / APO** (blood regurgitates into LA → ↑pulmonary venous pressure); large V waves on PCWP tracing

Bedside echocardiography is the fastest way to differentiate.

#### E. Ventricular Aneurysm

***Occurs in 8–15% with STEMI, esp persistent occlusion*** [1].
- ***70–85% at anterior or apical walls → due to LAD total occlusion without collateral*** [1]
- **Mechanism**: Transmural infarct → necrotic wall thins and is replaced by non-contractile scar tissue → during systole, this segment bulges outward (dyskinesis) instead of contracting
- ***Consequences*** [1]:
  - ***Acute decompensated HF with angina*** (wasted mechanical energy to enlarge aneurysm)
  - ***Ventricular arrhythmia*** due to myocardial irritation at the aneurysm border
  - ***Systemic embolisation: mural thrombus occurs in > 50%***
- ***Diagnosis***: ***paradoxical impulse on chest wall; ECG: persistent ↑ST and Q despite reperfusion; CXR: unusual bulge from cardiac silhouette; echo: diagnostic*** [1]
- ***Management***: ***oral anticoagulation if documented mural thrombus; aneurysmectomy + CABG if intractable VAs or HF refractory to medical therapy*** [1]

#### F. Embolism

***Most common in (1) anterior STEMI (2) LAD infarct (3) large infarct with EF < 30%*** [1].
- ***Mechanism: ventricular thrombus from wall motion abnormality/aneurysm; or atrial thrombus from AF*** [1]
- ***Risk of embolisation in non-anticoagulated documented LV thrombus is 10–15%*** [1]
- ***Consequences: stroke, ischaemic limb — classically occurring 1–3 weeks after MI*** [1]
- **Prevention**: anticoagulation when LV thrombus documented

#### G. Ventricular Remodelling and Chronic Heart Failure

After MI, the surviving myocardium must compensate for the lost contractile tissue. Over weeks to months:
1. Infarcted segment thins and expands (infarct expansion)
2. Non-infarcted segments hypertrophy and dilate to maintain CO (eccentric remodelling)
3. Chronic volume overload → progressive LV dilatation → functional MR → further dilatation → **vicious cycle → chronic HFrEF**

This is precisely why **ACEI/ARB** and **β-blockers** are given post-MI — they attenuate the neurohormonal activation (RAAS, sympathetic overdrive) that drives adverse remodelling.

#### H. Complications of PCI [1]

| ***Category*** | ***Complications*** |
|---|---|
| ***Coronary artery related*** | ***Dissection and abrupt closure (rare with stenting); intramural haematoma (6.7%); perforation (0.2–0.6%); side branch occlusion (up to 19%)*** — all can cause myocardial ischaemia/infarction |
| ***Stent-related*** | ***Stent thrombosis (1–2%): acute event, usually presents with severe STEMI or cardiac death. Due to thrombus at exposed stent surface before endothelialisation. Prevention: DAPT*** [1]. ***In-stent restenosis (ISR): chronic event (≥ 6–9 months), presents with recurrent stable angina. Due to intimal proliferation. Prevention: DES*** [1] |
| ***Access-related*** | ***Bleeding, infection, atheroembolism*** |
| ***Systemic*** | ***AKI (contrast, haemodynamic instability, atheroembolism); stroke (mural thrombus); bacteraemia*** |

### 2. Complications of Aortic Dissection

The complications of aortic dissection arise from **propagation of the false lumen** along the aorta, compressing or occluding branch vessels, or **rupture** of the weakened aortic wall.

***Type A complications*** [5]:
- ***Dissection into aortic valvular annulus → Aortic regurgitation*** — the dissection disrupts the geometry of the aortic root, preventing leaflet coaptation → acute severe AR → acute LVF → pulmonary oedema
- ***Dissection into pericardium → Cardiac tamponade*** — blood from the false lumen ruptures through the adventitia into the pericardial space → rapid accumulation of blood → ↑intrapericardial pressure → impaired diastolic filling → obstructive shock. This is the **commonest cause of death** in Type A dissection
- ***Dissection into coronary artery ostia → Myocardial infarction*** — usually the RCA (inferior MI pattern). PITFALL: looks like STEMI on ECG but giving thrombolytics is lethal
- ***Focal neurological deficits related to cerebrovascular ischaemia*** — dissection extends into brachiocephalic/carotid arteries → stroke, altered consciousness, Horner syndrome

***Type B complications*** [5]:
- ***Dissection into abdominal aortic branches → Coeliac / Renal / Lower limb ischaemia*** — malperfusion syndromes from compression of branch vessel ostia by the expanding false lumen
- ***Focal neurological deficits related to spinal ischaemia*** — compromise of the artery of Adamkiewicz (major blood supply to anterior spinal cord, usually arises T8–L2) → anterior spinal artery syndrome → paraplegia

**Both types**:
- **Aortic rupture**: into pleural space (haemothorax, usually left-sided), peritoneum, or mediastinum → haemorrhagic shock and death
- **Extension and chronic aneurysmal dilatation**: false lumen may thrombose and recanalise → progressive dilatation of the dissected aorta → chronic aneurysm requiring surveillance and potential intervention

***Prognosis of Type B dissections*** [5]:
- ***10% mortality at 30 days***
- ***25% at 3 years***
- ***50% at 5 years***

### 3. Complications of Pulmonary Embolism

| Complication | Mechanism | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Haemodynamic collapse / Obstructive shock** | Massive PE → acute RV pressure overload → RV dilatation → RV failure → ↓LV filling → ↓CO | Hypotension, syncope, PEA arrest, sudden death |
| **Pulmonary infarction** | Complete obstruction of segmental/subsegmental artery → distal lung tissue necrosis (only ~10% of PE cause infarction because of dual blood supply from bronchial arteries) | Pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, peripheral wedge-shaped opacity (Hampton hump) |
| **Right heart failure** | Acute or chronic RV pressure overload → RV dilatation + TR → systemic venous congestion | ↑JVP, hepatic congestion, peripheral oedema, exercise intolerance |
| **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** | ~3–4% of PE patients. Organised thrombus fails to resolve → permanent obstruction of pulmonary arteries → progressive ↑PVR → fixed pulmonary hypertension → RV failure | Progressive dyspnoea, exercise intolerance, RV failure. Diagnosed by V/Q scan (mismatched defects) + right heart catheterisation. Treated by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) or balloon pulmonary angioplasty |
| **Recurrent PE** | Ongoing risk factors (immobilisation, malignancy, thrombophilia) → recurrent DVT and embolisation | New pleuritic pain, dyspnoea; may present as CTEPH if multiple subclinical episodes |
| **Post-PE syndrome** | Persistent functional limitation after PE despite treatment — ?residual obstruction, RV dysfunction, or deconditioning | Exercise intolerance, dyspnoea, ↓QoL |

---

### 4. Complications of Pneumothorax

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Tension pneumothorax** | One-way valve → progressive air accumulation → mediastinal shift → compression of contralateral lung + impaired venous return → obstructive shock | Emergency needle decompression → chest drain |
| **Recurrence** | ***10–30% at 1–5 years for 1st PSP; 50% at 3 years for SSP*** [7]. Residual blebs/bullae predispose to repeat rupture | Surgical pleurodesis/pleurectomy + bullectomy for 2nd ipsilateral or 1st contralateral PTX |
| ***Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (RPO, 0–1%)*** [7] | ***Rapid re-expansion with restoration of blood flow into compressed capillaries → capillary damage with leakage*** [7] | ***S/S: cough, SOB, desaturation improving upon clamping drain*** [7]. ***RFs: lung collapse > 3 days, high-volume drainage, early suction use*** [7]. ***Mx: supportive + clamp drain*** |
| **Haemopneumothorax** | Torn pleural adhesion or intercostal vessel → blood + air in pleural space | Chest drain ± surgical intervention if ongoing haemorrhage |
| **Empyema** | Secondary infection of retained pleural fluid/blood | Antibiotics + chest drain ± surgical decortication |
| **Subcutaneous/surgical emphysema** | Air tracks from pleural space into subcutaneous tissues via chest wall injury or drain site | Usually self-resolving; ensure drain is functioning |

### 5. Complications of Pneumonia

***Complications of community-acquired pneumonia*** [22]:
- ***Respiratory failure*** — extensive consolidation → V/Q mismatch → hypoxia; or severe sepsis → ARDS
- ***Lung abscess formation*** — necrosis of lung parenchyma, especially with anaerobic organisms or aspiration
- ***Spread***:
  - ***Septicaemia with multi-organ failure*** — bacteria enter bloodstream from infected lung
  - ***Parapneumonic effusion ± empyema thoracis*** — exudative effusion develops as parietal pleural inflammation increases capillary permeability; if infected → empyema (frank pus)
- ***Systemic effects***:
  - ***Electrolyte abnormalities, e.g., hypoNa due to SIADH*** — pulmonary inflammation stimulates ADH release → water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia
  - ***Cardiac complications: acute MI, cardiac arrhythmia (esp AF)*** [22] — systemic inflammation → increased myocardial O₂ demand + direct inflammatory effect on myocardium → demand ischaemia or arrhythmia

### 6. Complications of Pericarditis

| Complication | Mechanism | Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Pericardial effusion** | Inflammatory exudate accumulates in pericardial space | May be asymptomatic; large effusions cause dyspnoea, muffled heart sounds |
| **Cardiac tamponade** | Rapid accumulation of fluid (or slow accumulation exceeding pericardial compliance) → ↑intrapericardial pressure → impaired diastolic filling → ↓CO | Beck's triad (hypotension, distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds); pulsus paradoxus; electrical alternans on ECG |
| **Constrictive pericarditis** | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis and calcification of pericardium → rigid "shell" encasing heart → restricted diastolic filling | Kussmaul sign (↑JVP on inspiration — because rigid pericardium cannot accommodate ↑venous return), pericardial knock, hepatomegaly, ascites (out of proportion to peripheral oedema). CXR may show pericardial calcification. Treatment: pericardiectomy |
| **Recurrence** | ~30% recurrence rate without colchicine; autoimmune mechanism | Recurrent episodes of pericarditic chest pain, fever, ↑inflammatory markers. Prevention: colchicine × 3 months |
| **Myopericarditis** | Inflammation extends from pericardium into adjacent myocardium | ↑Troponin, regional wall motion abnormalities; risk of LV dysfunction |

---

### 7. Complications of GERD (as a Cause of Chest Pain)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Oesophagitis** | Chronic acid exposure → inflammation of squamous epithelium → erosions, ulcers |
| **Oesophageal stricture** | Chronic oesophagitis → fibrosis → luminal narrowing → dysphagia |
| **Barrett's oesophagus** | Chronic acid injury → intestinal metaplasia (squamous → columnar epithelium with goblet cells) as a protective adaptation → **pre-malignant condition** |
| **Oesophageal adenocarcinoma** | Barrett's → dysplasia → adenocarcinoma (the metaplasia–dysplasia–carcinoma sequence) |
| **Aspiration** | Reflux reaches larynx/pharynx → aspiration into airways → recurrent pneumonia, chronic cough, laryngitis |

---

### 8. Complications Arising from Treatment of Chest Pain Aetiologies

#### A. Complications of Anticoagulation / Antiplatelets

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bleeding** (most common) | All anticoagulants/antiplatelets impair haemostasis → ↑risk of GI haemorrhage, intracranial haemorrhage, access-site bleeding |
| **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** | Antibodies against heparin-PF4 complexes → platelet activation → paradoxical thrombosis + thrombocytopenia. Type II HIT is immune-mediated and dangerous → must stop all heparin → switch to non-heparin anticoagulant (argatroban) |

#### B. Complications of Fibrinolysis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Intracranial haemorrhage (~1%)** | Plasmin dissolves fibrin indiscriminately → bleeding at vulnerable sites (especially if pre-existing cerebrovascular disease) |
| **Reperfusion arrhythmias** | Washout of metabolites from ischaemic tissue → transient electrical instability → accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR), VT, VF. AIVR is usually benign and self-limiting — it is actually a **sign of successful reperfusion** |
| **Reperfusion injury** | Paradoxical myocardial damage upon restoration of blood flow — mechanisms include reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**MI complications by timing**:
- **Immediate (hours)**: Arrhythmias (VF/VT — commonest cause of early death; sinus bradycardia in inferior MI; AV block)
- **Early (days 1–7)**: Pump failure (LV dysfunction → APO/cardiogenic shock; RV infarction → manage with fluids NOT diuretics); peri-infarction pericarditis (day 2–3); mechanical complications (septal rupture, free wall rupture → tamponade, papillary muscle rupture → acute MR)
- **Late (weeks–months)**: Ventricular aneurysm (anterior wall, persistent ST elevation, mural thrombus); Dressler syndrome (autoimmune pericarditis); thromboembolism (stroke, ischaemic limb 1–3 weeks post-MI); ventricular remodelling → chronic HFrEF

**Aortic dissection complications**: Type A → AR, tamponade (commonest cause of death), MI, stroke. Type B → visceral/renal/limb ischaemia, spinal cord ischaemia → paraplegia. Both → rupture (haemothorax, haemoperitoneum).

**PE complications**: Obstructive shock (massive), pulmonary infarction, RV failure, CTEPH (3–4%).

**Pneumothorax complications**: Tension PTX (obstructive shock), recurrence (10–50%), re-expansion pulmonary oedema.

**Key exam trap**: RV infarction = give fluids, avoid diuretics/vasodilators. New PSM post-MI = distinguish VSD (RLSB, RV failure) from acute MR (apex, APO).

      markscheme: "Most likely ventricular septal rupture (VSD). Usually complicates anterior MI (LAD), occurs at margin of necrotic and viable myocardium. VSD: murmur loudest at LLSB, causes RV failure (L-to-R shunt overloads RV), step-up in O2 saturation in RV on catheterisation.

      question: "Explain why a patient with inferior STEMI and RV infarction should receive IV fluids rather than diuretics, and state one bedside finding that distinguishes RV from LV failure.",
      markscheme: "In RV infarction, the failing RV cannot pump blood into the pulmonary circulation, so the LV is underfilled. The patient has low cardiac output without pulmonary oedema. Diuretics or vasodilators would reduce RV preload further, worsening shock. IV fluids increase RV preload, helping push blood forward through the pulmonary vasculature. Distinguishing finding: non-compressible IVC on bedside echo (volume overload of RV without LV congestion), or raised JVP with clear lungs on auscultation."

      question: "What is Dressler syndrome? State its timing, mechanism, clinical features, and treatment.",
      markscheme: "Dressler syndrome (post-cardiac injury syndrome) occurs weeks to months post-MI. Mechanism: autoimmunity triggered by release of cardiac antigens (from necrotic myocardium) into the pericardial space, stimulating an immune response against pericardial tissue. Features: persistent fever, recurrent pericarditic chest pain (positional, pleuritic), pleurisy, raised inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR/WCC), pericardial and/or pleural effusion. Treatment: high-dose aspirin or NSAID (e.g., indomethacin 25-50mg TDS) plus colchicine. Steroids used cautiously only if refractory, as they increase recurrence and impair myocardial scar healing."

    {
      question: "What is re-expansion pulmonary oedema, what are its risk factors, and how is it managed?",
      markscheme: "Re-expansion pulmonary oedema (RPO) occurs in 0-1% of cases after treatment of pneumothorax. Mechanism: rapid re-expansion of collapsed lung restores blood flow into previously compressed capillaries that have sustained ischaemic damage, leading to increased capillary permeability and fluid leakage into alveoli. Risk factors: lung collapse >3 days, high-volume drainage, early suction use. Clinical features: cough, SOB, desaturation that improves upon clamping the drain. CXR: alveolar shadowing in the re-expanded lung. Management: supportive care plus clamping the drain to slow re-expansion."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient develops accelerated idioventricular rhythm 90 minutes after receiving fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI. Is this concerning, and what does it signify?",
      markscheme: "Accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) after fibrinolysis is generally NOT concerning and is usually benign and self-limiting. It is actually a sign of successful reperfusion. Mechanism: restoration of blood flow to ischaemic myocardium causes washout of accumulated metabolites (adenosine, K+, lactate) and reactive oxygen species, leading to transient electrical instability. AIVR typically has a rate of 60-120 bpm and resolves spontaneously. Other markers of successful fibrinolysis include resolution of chest pain, ≥50% resolution of ST elevation in worst lead at 60-90 min, and early peaking of CK at 11-12h."
