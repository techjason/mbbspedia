## Differential Diagnosis of Chest Pain

The differential diagnosis of chest pain is one of the broadest in clinical medicine. The key intellectual task is not to memorise a long list, but to **stratify by risk** (life-threatening vs benign), **categorise by system** (cardiac, pulmonary, GI, MSK, neuro, psych), and then use **specific discriminating features** (onset, quality, radiation, provocating/palliating factors, associated symptoms, risk factors) to narrow the field. Think of it as a funnel: start wide, risk-stratify immediately, then refine.

### Organising Framework

The single most useful framework for the exam (and for clinical practice) is **Murtagh's diagnostic strategy** [8], which forces you to think probabilistically:

> ***Probability diagnosis*** (commonest causes — account for the majority of presentations):
> - ***Musculoskeletal (chest wall) including costochondritis***
> - ***Psychogenic***
> - ***Angina***
>
> ***Serious disorders not to be missed*** (life-threatening — rule these out first):
> - ***Cardiovascular: myocardial infarction / unstable angina, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism / infarction***
> - ***Neoplasia / cancer: lung cancer, tumours of spinal cord and meninges***
> - ***Infection: pneumonia / pleuritis (pleurisy), mediastinitis, pericarditis, myocarditis***
> - ***Pneumothorax***
>
> ***Pitfalls (often missed)***:
> - ***Mitral valve prolapse***
> - ***Oesophageal spasm***
> - ***Gastro-oesophageal reflux***
> - ***Biliary colic***
> - ***Peptic ulcer***
>
> Additional pitfalls from the slides [8]:
> - ***Herpes zoster***
> - ***Fractured rib (e.g. cough fracture)***
> - ***Spinal dysfunction***
> - ***Precordial catch ("stitch" in side)***
>
> ***Rarities***:
> - ***Pancreatitis***
> - ***Bornholm disease (pleurodynia)***
> - ***Cocaine inhalation (can increase ischaemia)***
> - ***Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy***
>
> ***Masquerades checklist*** [8]:
> - ***Depression (possible)***
> - ***Anaemia (indirect)***
> - ***Spinal dysfunction***
>
> ***Is the patient trying to tell me something?***
> - ***Consider functional causes, especially anxiety with hyperventilation, opioid dependency*** [8]

<Callout title="Why Use Murtagh's Framework?">
It mirrors real clinical thinking. You do not start by listing every possible cause — you start by asking: "What is most likely?" (probability diagnosis), then "What can kill the patient if I miss it?" (serious disorders), then "What do doctors commonly miss?" (pitfalls). This approach prevents both over-investigation and under-diagnosis.

### Differential Diagnosis Stratified by Clinical Setting

#### A. Acute Chest Pain

This is the emergency department scenario. The priority is to **rule out life-threatening causes** before considering benign ones.

***Potentially severe or life-threatening*** [1][2]:

| Diagnosis | Key Discriminating Features | Why It's Dangerous |
|---|---|---|
| ***Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)*** | ***Dull compressive central chest pain at rest, radiating to jaw/neck/left arm, lasts > 20–30 min with gradual onset*** [1]; autonomic features (diaphoresis, N/V); ***angina equivalents in elderly/DM*** [2] | Ongoing myocardial necrosis → cardiogenic shock, fatal arrhythmia |
| ***Aortic dissection*** | ***Sudden, excruciating, tearing/ripping pain at anterior chest, radiating to interscapular region/back/abdomen; may occur with heavy isometric exercise or extreme BP elevation*** [1]; pulse deficit, BP discrepancy between arms; ***Hx of HTN, connective tissue disorder*** [1] | Rupture → haemorrhagic death; coronary/cerebral malperfusion |
| ***Acute pulmonary embolism*** | ***Severe pleuritic pain with sudden onset; dyspnoea ± cyanosis and collapse if massive; S/S of DVT; a/w thrombophilia*** [1]; ***sinus tachycardia, RV strain pattern (RBBB, S1Q3T3)*** [6] | Massive PE → obstructive shock → cardiac arrest |
| ***Tension or massive pneumothorax*** | ***Unilateral, sharp, localised pleuritic pain with sudden onset; dyspnoea; Hx of trauma or underlying lung disease*** [1]; absent breath sounds + hyperresonance + tracheal deviation | Mediastinal shift → obstructive shock |
| ***Pneumonia*** | Pleuritic pain + productive cough + fever + dyspnoea; consolidation signs on exam | Sepsis, respiratory failure |
| ***Myopericarditis ± cardiac tamponade*** | ***Sharp, pleuritic pain of variable duration, positional (improves sitting forward); retrosternal, radiating to shoulder/neck; insidious onset, may be a/w prodromal viral illness*** [1]; friction rub; Beck's triad if tamponade | Tamponade → obstructive shock |
| ***Acute decompensated heart failure*** | Dyspnoea > pain; bilateral crackles, S3, raised JVP, peripheral oedema; Hx of cardiac disease | Pulmonary oedema, cardiogenic shock |

***Relatively benign causes*** [1][2]:

| Diagnosis | Key Discriminating Features |
|---|---|
| ***Episode of stable angina*** | Predictable with exertion, resolves with rest/GTN < 5 min, CCS grading ≤ III |
| ***GERD*** | ***Retrosternal burning pain a/w supine position and recent eating/drinking; may radiate to back; may be a/w dysphagia*** [1] |
| ***Small pneumothorax*** | Mild pleuritic pain, minimal SOB, haemodynamically stable |
| ***Musculoskeletal pain*** | ***Sharp intense pain ± local tenderness ± preceded by trauma; may vary with posture/movement*** [1]; reproducible on palpation |
| ***Panic attack*** | ***No predictable pattern of pain; ± hyperventilation features (dizziness, perioral/digital paraesthesia); Hx and features of anxiety*** [1] |

<Callout title="Important Exam Concept" type="error">
***"One must be careful to attribute a chest pain to psychogenic causes merely basing on features of anxiety, as the prospect of a heart disease is a frightening experience and organic heart diseases may coexist with anxiety"*** [1]. In other words, a patient with anxiety features can still have an ACS. Always rule out life-threatening causes FIRST.
</Callout>

#### B. Stable / Chronic Chest Pain

This is the outpatient or clinic scenario. The priority shifts towards identifying occult serious disease while managing common causes.

***Potentially severe*** [1][2]:

| Diagnosis | Key Discriminating Features |
|---|---|
| ***Stable ischaemic heart disease*** | Exertional chest discomfort with typical quality and duration; predictable threshold; relieved by rest/GTN |
| ***Subacute/chronic pulmonary embolism*** | Progressive exertional dyspnoea ± pleuritic pain; risk factors for VTE; may develop into CTEPH |
| ***Malignancy with pleural/chest wall involvement*** | Persistent, progressive pain; weight loss, haemoptysis, smoking Hx; may have bone pain (metastases) |
| ***Pulmonary hypertension*** | Exertional dyspnoea, exertional chest pain, exertional syncope; loud P2; progressive RV failure signs |

***Benign*** [1][2]:

| Diagnosis | Key Discriminating Features |
|---|---|
| ***GERD and other oesophageal pathologies*** | Postural aggravation, meal-related, burning quality; response to PPI trial |
| ***Musculoskeletal pain*** | Reproducible tenderness, movement-related, no cardiac risk factors |
| ***Psychogenic chest pain*** | Inconsistent patterns; hyperventilation features; Hx of anxiety/depression |
| ***Herpes zoster*** | ***Severe, unilateral dermatomal burning pain; ± rash (may come after pain or without pain → zoster sine herpete)*** [1] |

### Comprehensive System-by-System Differential Diagnosis Table

The table below is the master reference for differentiating every major cause. The key principle: **each diagnosis has a signature pattern** — learn the signature, and you can differentiate efficiently.

| | ***Peptic ulcer*** | Burning, gnawing, epigastric | Meal-related | Hours | ***GU: ↑ after meal; DU: ↓ after meal, ↑ 2h post-prandially*** [3] | Back (if posterior ulcer) | Haematemesis, melaena; NSAID/H. pylori Hx |
| | ***Biliary colic*** | Intense, dull, constant (NOT colicky despite the name) | After fatty meal | > 30 min to hours | ***NOT ↑ by movement; NOT ↓ by squatting or bowel movement*** [3] | Right scapula, right shoulder | Nausea, diaphoresis; Murphy's sign if cholecystitis |
| | ***Pancreatitis*** | Epigastric, boring | Acute | Hours–days | ***Worse supine; better leaning forward*** | Straight through to back | Nausea, vomiting; alcohol/gallstone Hx |
| **MSK** | ***Costochondritis*** | Sharp, localised | Gradual or after strain | Days–weeks | Palpation, movement, deep breathing | None | Reproducible tenderness at costochondral junctions |

| | ***Spinal dysfunction*** | Dermatomal, aching/burning | Insidious | Chronic | Spinal movement, posture | Dermatomal distribution | May be a/w back pain |
| **Neuro** | ***Herpes zoster*** | Burning, lancinating | Pre-rash: 2–3 days before vesicles | Days–weeks | Touch (allodynia) | Along dermatome | Vesicular rash on erythematous base; dermatomal |

### Differential Diagnosis in Specific Clinical Scenarios

#### Differentials of Aortic Dissection [5]

When a patient presents with sudden, severe chest/back pain — these are the diagnoses competing with aortic dissection:

- ***Pneumothorax*** [5]
- ***Pulmonary embolism*** [5]
- ***Pericarditis*** [5]
- ***Acute pancreatitis*** [5]
- ***Acute myocardial infarction (AMI)*** [5]

Why are these the key differentials? Because they share overlapping features:
- **ACS vs dissection**: Both cause severe chest pain, but ACS builds gradually while dissection is maximal at onset; ACS responds to GTN while dissection does not; dissection causes pulse deficit/BP discrepancy while ACS does not. **Crucial pitfall**: Dissection extending into coronary ostia CAN cause a genuine STEMI — giving thrombolytics in this scenario is catastrophic (→ haemorrhagic death). Always consider dissection before thrombolysis.
- **PE vs dissection**: Both cause sudden severe pain with haemodynamic compromise. PE is pleuritic (unless massive); dissection is tearing. PE has DVT risk factors; dissection has HTN/connective tissue risk factors.
- **Pneumothorax vs dissection**: Both are sudden onset. PTX is unilateral and pleuritic with absent breath sounds; dissection has tearing quality with vascular signs.

#### Differentials of PE [6]

When you suspect PE, consider:
- ***Stable angina or ACS*** [6]
- ***Pneumothorax*** [6]
- ***Aortic dissection*** [6]
- ***Gastrointestinal causes*** [6]
- ***Musculoskeletal causes*** [6]

#### Differentials in Chest Pain in Children [8]

> ***Probability diagnosis*** [8]:
> - ***Musculoskeletal chest wall pain: cough strain (10%), injury, muscle strain, costochondritis***
> - ***Precordial catch syndrome ("stitch" in side)***
> - ***Asthma***
> - ***Most cases are unknown (21%)***
>
> ***Serious disorders not to be missed*** [8]:
> - ***Vascular: ischaemic pain from structural cardiac conditions***
> - ***Arrhythmias (e.g. PSVT)***
> - ***Infection: pericarditis, myocarditis, pneumonia, herpes zoster***
> - ***Pneumothorax***
> - ***POTS syndrome***
>
> ***Pitfalls***: ***Kawasaki syndrome, breast disorders*** [8]
>
> ***Rarities***: ***Bornholm disease, oesophagitis or gastric pain*** [8]
>
> ***Psychogenic: stress, anxiety, depression (10%)*** [8]

<Callout title="Key Exam Tip: Chest Pain in Children" type="idea">
***Less than 5% of cases are caused by cardiac disease*** [8]. ***Myocardial ischaemia is rare in children but consider it in any child with exercise-induced pain, adolescents with longstanding diabetes, and children with sickle cell anaemia*** [8]. The vast majority is benign — musculoskeletal, idiopathic, or psychogenic. But never completely dismiss cardiac causes without asking the right questions (family history of sudden death, exercise-triggered symptoms, known structural heart disease).

### Discriminating Features: A Quick-Reference Table for the "Big Five" Life-Threatening Differentials

| Feature | ACS | Aortic Dissection | PE | Tension PTX | Pericarditis/Tamponade |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Onset** | Gradual (minutes) | ***Sudden, maximal at onset*** | Sudden | Sudden | Subacute (hours–days) |
| **Quality** | Dull, crushing | Tearing, ripping | Pleuritic (sharp) | Pleuritic (sharp) | Sharp, pleuritic |
| **Radiation** | L arm, jaw, neck | Back, abdomen (migratory) | Shoulder tip | Ipsilateral shoulder | Trapezius ridge |
| **Position** | No change | No change | No change | No change | ***Better sitting forward*** |
| **Respiration** | No change | No change | ***Worse on inspiration*** | ***Worse on inspiration*** | Worse on inspiration |
| **BP** | May be ↑ or ↓ | Discrepancy between arms | ↓ if massive | ↓ with tracheal deviation | Pulsus paradoxus |
| **ECG** | ST↑ / ST↓ / T changes | Often normal; may show ST↑ if coronary involved | Sinus tachy, ***S1Q3T3, RBBB*** | Low voltage (if tension) | ***Diffuse ST↑, PR↓*** |
| **CXR** | Usually non-diagnostic | ***Widened mediastinum*** | Hampton hump, Westermark sign | Absent lung markings, tracheal shift | ***Globular heart*** (if effusion) |
| **Key Hx** | CVD risk factors, prior angina | HTN, Marfan, bicuspid AV | Immobilisation, malignancy, OCP | Tall/thin, COPD, trauma | Recent viral illness |

<Callout title="Critical Pitfall: Aortic Dissection Mimicking STEMI" type="error">
Aortic dissection extending into the coronary ostia (usually the right coronary artery → inferior STEMI pattern) can present with genuine ST elevation on ECG. If you give thrombolytics without first excluding dissection, the patient bleeds out through the torn aorta. **Always consider dissection in the differential of STEMI, especially when the pain is tearing, maximal at onset, or there is BP discrepancy / pulse deficit.** A CT aortography or transoesophageal echo should be done urgently if clinical suspicion is high before committing to thrombolysis (but do not delay primary PCI if dissection is excluded).
</Callout>

### Psychological and Functional Differentials — Important but Under-Recognised

***Panic disorder*** [13] deserves special mention because it is a **very common** cause of chest pain presentations to the ED, and the **somatic symptoms** (palpitations, chest pain, SOB, sweating, trembling) **perfectly mimic** cardiac disease:
- ***Recurrent, unexpected panic attacks with abrupt surge of intense fear/discomfort peaking in minutes*** [13]
- ***≥ 4 of 13 symptoms required*** (DSM-5) including palpitations, sweating, trembling, SOB, choking, ***chest pain or discomfort***, nausea, dizziness, paraesthesia, derealisation, fear of losing control, fear of dying [13]
- ***Unexpected*** = no obvious trigger; this distinguishes panic disorder from panic attacks in other anxiety disorders where attacks are usually ***expected*** (e.g., triggered by social situations in social phobia, phobic stimuli in specific phobia) [13]
- ***Persistent concern/worry about additional attacks or maladaptive behaviour changes for ≥ 1 month*** [13]

***Somatic symptom disorder*** [14]:
- ***≥ 1 somatic symptom (chest pain, multiple pains, etc.) that is distressing or results in significant disruption***
- ***Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviours related to the somatic symptoms***
- ***High healthcare utilisation, doctor-shopping, repeated negative workups*** [14]

***Psychogenic hyperventilation*** [17] — features suggesting this:
- ***Subjective feeling of "inability to take a deep breath"***
- ***Frequent sighing / erratic ventilation at rest***
- ***Digital / perioral paraesthesiae***
- ***Light-headedness***
- ***Central chest discomfort***
- ***Occurs at rest, rarely disturbs sleep***

The pathophysiology: hyperventilation → ↓PaCO₂ → respiratory alkalosis → ↓ionised Ca²⁺ → neuromuscular excitability → paraesthesia and carpopedal spasm; also coronary vasoconstriction → genuine chest discomfort.

---

### Oesophageal Causes — The "Great Mimickers"

Oesophageal causes are listed under "pitfalls" [8] because they are so commonly missed:

1. ***GERD***: Retrosternal burning, meal-related, postural. Can respond to GTN (relaxes LES smooth muscle), further confusing the picture. ***Asian patients tend to present atypically with NCCP*** [3].
2. ***Oesophageal spasm***: May be indistinguishable from angina. Both are central, constricting, and may respond to GTN. The critical differentiator is often negative cardiac workup + positive oesophageal manometry (***simultaneous contractions of oesophageal body, intact LES relaxation***) [16].
3. ***Achalasia***: Retrosternal chest pain related to oesophageal spasm; associated with dysphagia for solids AND liquids (unlike mechanical obstruction which is solids > liquids initially) [16].

---

### Masquerades [8]

These are systemic conditions that present as or exacerbate chest pain:

- ***Depression***: Can present with somatic symptoms including chest pain; also ↓pain threshold and ↑health anxiety
- ***Anaemia (indirect)***: Does not cause chest pain directly, but ↓O₂-carrying capacity → unmasked angina in patients with co-existing (even subclinical) CAD. This is why ***anaemia is listed as a condition that may exacerbate angina*** [1][2]
- ***Spinal dysfunction***: Thoracic disc disease, facet joint arthropathy → dermatomal or referred chest wall pain

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Framework**: Use Murtagh's five-box approach — Probability diagnosis (MSK, psychogenic, angina), Serious (ACS, dissection, PE, PTX, pneumonia, pericarditis, cancer), Pitfalls (MVP, oesophageal spasm, GERD, biliary colic, PUD), Rarities (pancreatitis, Bornholm, cocaine, HCMP), Masquerades (depression, anaemia, spinal dysfunction).

**Acute DDx priority**: ACS > aortic dissection > PE > tension PTX > tamponade > pneumonia. ECG + troponin + CXR within 10 minutes.

**Key discriminators**:
- Maximal at onset → dissection, PTX, PE (NOT ACS)
- Tearing to back + BP discrepancy → dissection
- Pleuritic + DVT signs → PE
- Absent breath sounds + hyperresonance → PTX
- Positional (better sitting forward) → pericarditis
- Reproducible on palpation → musculoskeletal
- Burning, postural, meal-related → GERD
- Responds to GTN → angina OR oesophageal spasm (pitfall!)

**Children**: < 5% cardiac; MSK and idiopathic predominate; consider cardiac in exercise-induced pain, longstanding DM, sickle cell.

**Never attribute chest pain to anxiety/psychogenic until life-threatening causes are excluded** — organic disease and anxiety coexist.

**Critical pitfall**: Dissection can mimic STEMI (coronary ostial involvement); thrombolysis in dissection is lethal.
