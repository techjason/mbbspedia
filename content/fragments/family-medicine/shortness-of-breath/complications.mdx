## Complications of Conditions Causing Shortness of Breath

Since dyspnoea is a symptom rather than a disease, the complications to discuss are those of the **underlying conditions** that cause dyspnoea, as well as the **complications of treatment modalities** (especially mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy). This section systematically covers both.

The logic is straightforward: understand the disease mechanism → understand what goes wrong when that mechanism spirals further → anticipate and prevent complications.

---

## A. Complications of Acute Dyspnoea Itself

Dyspnoea, regardless of cause, can lead to a common final pathway of deterioration if untreated:

| Complication | Mechanism | Why It Matters |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Respiratory failure** (Type 1 or 2) | Any untreated cause of dyspnoea → progressive gas exchange failure | Hypoxaemia → end-organ damage (brain, heart, kidneys); hypercapnia → CO₂ narcosis → coma |
| **Respiratory arrest** | Diaphragmatic fatigue (paradoxical breathing) → complete ventilatory failure | Fatal unless immediately ventilated |
| **Cardiac arrest** | Profound hypoxaemia → myocardial ischaemia → arrhythmia → VF/asystole | Most common final cause of death in respiratory emergencies |
| **Hypoxic brain injury** | PaO₂ critically low → neuronal death (irreversible after ~4–6 min without O₂) | Permanent cognitive impairment, vegetative state |
| **Multi-organ failure** | Prolonged tissue hypoxia → cellular injury across all organs | High mortality once established |

## B. Complications by Specific Underlying Condition

### 1. Heart Failure

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Cardiogenic shock** | Progressive ↓CO → ↓organ perfusion → lactic acidosis | ***↓systolic function → ↓coronary perfusion → ↓supply → ischaemia; ↓diastolic function → ↑pulmonary congestion → hypoxaemia → ischaemia*** — a downward spiral [45] |
| **Arrhythmias** (AF, VT, VF) | Atrial stretch → AF; ventricular remodelling/ischaemia → VT/VF | Leading cause of sudden cardiac death in HF |
| **Pulmonary oedema** | ↑LV filling pressure → transudation into alveoli | Acute respiratory failure with pink frothy sputum |
| **Renal failure** (cardiorenal syndrome) | ↓CO → ↓renal perfusion → pre-renal AKI; also ↑venous congestion → ↑renal venous pressure | Worsens fluid overload (can't diurese) → vicious cycle |
| **Hepatic congestion** ("cardiac cirrhosis") | ↑RA pressure → ↑hepatic venous pressure → centrilobular necrosis | ↑Bilirubin, ↑ALP; chronic: fibrosis |
| **Thromboembolic events** | Low CO → stasis in dilated chambers → intracardiac thrombus (esp. in AF) → stroke/systemic embolism; also ↑DVT risk from immobility | Stroke prevention with anticoagulation in AF |
| **Cardiac cachexia** | Chronic neurohormonal activation (↑TNF-α, ↑IL-6) → catabolic state + anorexia | Poor prognosis marker; involuntary weight loss > 6% over 6–12 months |

### 2. Acute Coronary Syndrome / Myocardial Infarction

***Complications of MI indicate extensive myocardial damage → poor prognosis (↑likelihood of other complications)*** [45]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Immediate** | Arrhythmias (VF, VT, bradyarrhythmias) | Ischaemic myocardium is electrically unstable; acidotic tissue → K⁺ shifts → abnormal automaticity |
| **Early (days)** | ***Pump failure → cardiogenic shock*** [45] | Loss of contractile myocardium |
| **Early** | Acute mitral regurgitation | Papillary muscle rupture (usually posteromedial papillary muscle — supplied by single vessel, PDA) |
| **Early (3–5 d)** | Ventricular septal rupture | Necrosis of interventricular septum → L-to-R shunt → ↑pulmonary blood flow → acute HF |
| **Early (3–7 d)** | Free wall rupture | Necrosis of ventricular wall → haemopericardium → tamponade → sudden death |
| **Early** | Pericarditis (fibrinous) | Transmural MI → epicardial inflammation |
| **Late (weeks)** | Ventricular aneurysm | Scar tissue formation → paradoxical outward movement → ↓CO, source of thrombus |
| **Late (weeks)** | Dressler syndrome | Autoimmune pericarditis (anti-myocardial antibodies) → fever, pleuritic pain, pericardial effusion |
| **Late** | Post-infarct angina | ***Residual stenosis → up to 50% in thrombolysis patients*** [45] |

### 3. Pulmonary Embolism

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Acute RV failure / cardiogenic shock** | Massive PE → acute ↑RV afterload → RV dilatation → ↓LV filling → ↓CO | Hypotension, ↑JVP, clear lungs — the primary cause of death in PE |
| **Pulmonary infarction** | Distal small-vessel PE → lung tissue necrosis (only occurs in ~10% because bronchial circulation provides collateral supply) | Pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, wedge-shaped opacity on CXR (Hampton hump) |
| **Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** | Incomplete resolution of thrombus → organised thrombus → chronic ↑PVR → progressive RV failure | Progressive exertional dyspnoea months-years after PE; diagnosis by V/Q scan + right heart catheterisation; treatment: pulmonary endarterectomy |
| **Recurrent VTE** | Underlying risk factors persist → new DVT/PE | 10–30% recurrence rate at 5 years if anticoagulation stopped; higher if unprovoked |
| **Post-thrombotic syndrome** | ***Chronic venous insufficiency*** from DVT → valvular damage → venous hypertension [46] | Chronic leg swelling, pain, skin changes, ulceration |
| **Death** | RV failure, arrhythmia | 1–3% case mortality overall; up to 30% if massive PE untreated |

***Complications of DVT specifically*** [46]:
- ***Pulmonary embolism***
- ***Chronic venous insufficiency → leads to pulmonary hypertension***
- ***Chronic venous obstruction → leads to pulmonary hypertension***

### 4. Pneumonia

***Complications of pneumonia*** [47]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| ***Respiratory failure*** | Extensive alveolar consolidation → shunt → severe hypoxaemia | O₂, NIV, or IPPV |
| ***Lung abscess formation*** | Necrotising infection → cavitation (esp. *Klebsiella*, *S. aureus*, anaerobes, aspiration) | Prolonged antibiotics ± percutaneous/surgical drainage |
| ***Septicaemia with multi-organ failure*** | Bacteraemia → systemic inflammatory response → distributive shock → organ dysfunction | Sepsis bundle: fluids, broad-spectrum Abx, vasopressors, source control |
| ***Parapneumonic effusion ± empyema thoracis*** | Inflammatory exudate into pleural space → if infected → empyema | Thoracocentesis → if pus/low pH ( < 7.2)/positive culture → chest drain ± surgical decortication |
| ***Electrolyte abnormalities (hypoNa from SIADH)*** | Lung inflammation → ↑ADH secretion from posterior pituitary → water retention → dilutional hypoNa | Fluid restriction; treat underlying pneumonia |
| ***Cardiac complications: acute MI, arrhythmia (esp AF)*** | Systemic inflammation + hypoxia → myocardial stress → demand ischaemia; atrial inflammation → AF | Standard ACS/AF management |

***Causes of unresolving pneumonia*** [47]: host factors (COPD, aspiration, immunosuppression), resistant organisms (Pseudomonas, MRSA, Acinetobacter), unusual pathogens (TB, fungi, Nocardia), complicated pneumonia (empyema, abscess), non-infectious mimics (malignancy, organising pneumonia)

### 5. COPD

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Acute exacerbations** | Viral/bacterial infection + air pollution → ↑airway inflammation → ↑airflow obstruction → acute-on-chronic respiratory failure | ↑SOB, ↑cough, ↑sputum; if hospitalised, 5-year mortality ~50% |
| **Cor pulmonale** | Chronic hypoxia → hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction → ↑PVR → chronic ↑PAP → RV hypertrophy → RV failure | ↑JVP, peripheral oedema, hepatomegaly, RV heave, loud P2, TR murmur |
| **Polycythaemia** | Chronic hypoxia → ↑EPO → ↑RBC production | ↑Hct → hyperviscosity → ↑risk of thrombosis (stroke, DVT/PE) |
| **Respiratory failure** (Type 2) | Decompensated hypoventilation → ↑CO₂ + ↓O₂ | CO₂ narcosis, flapping tremor, headache, confusion |
| **Pneumothorax** | Bullae rupture → air enters pleural space | Especially in emphysema; can be tension |
| **Lung cancer** | Shared risk factor (smoking) → 4× ↑risk | Weight loss, haemoptysis, new persistent cough |
| **Depression and anxiety** | Chronic breathlessness + functional limitation → psychological distress | ↓QoL, ↓adherence, ↑exacerbations |
| **Osteoporosis** | Chronic steroid use + systemic inflammation + inactivity + smoking | Vertebral fractures → kyphosis → further ↓chest wall compliance |

### 6. Asthma

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Status asthmaticus** (near-fatal asthma) | Severe bronchospasm + mucus plugging → respiratory failure | Silent chest, exhaustion, respiratory arrest |
| **Pneumothorax / pneumomediastinum** | Air trapping → alveolar rupture | Sudden pleuritic pain, subcutaneous emphysema |
| **Irreversible airflow obstruction** | Chronic airway remodelling (subepithelial fibrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy) → fixed narrowing | Progressive decline in FEV₁ despite treatment; asthma-COPD overlap |
| **Steroid side effects** (chronic/repeated oral steroids) | Iatrogenic Cushing's, osteoporosis, DM, adrenal suppression, cataracts, immunosuppression | Minimise OCS use; emphasise ICS + biologics for severe asthma |

### 7. Interstitial Lung Disease / IPF

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Progressive respiratory failure** | Inexorable fibrosis → ↓gas exchange area → ↓DLCO → exertional then resting hypoxaemia |
| ***Pulmonary hypertension*** | Destruction of pulmonary vascular bed + hypoxic vasoconstriction → ↑PVR → RV failure [48] |
| **Acute exacerbation of IPF** | Rapid, unexplained worsening (diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on UIP) → bilateral GGO on HRCT → high mortality ( > 50%) |
| **Lung cancer** | IPF is an independent risk factor (8–14% of IPF patients develop lung cancer) |
| ***Infections*** | Immunosuppressive therapy (if used for non-IPF ILD) → opportunistic infections [48] |

### 8. OSA

***Complications*** of obstructive sleep apnoea [49]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Hypertension*** | Repetitive arousals → intermittent sympathetic surges → sustained ↑SNS activity → ↑BP; also ↑oxidative stress → endothelial dysfunction |
| ***Diabetes mellitus / metabolic syndrome*** | Intermittent hypoxia → insulin resistance; also shared risk factor (obesity) |
| ***Cardiovascular events*** (MI, stroke, AF) | Chronic intermittent hypoxia + sympathetic activation + endothelial dysfunction → accelerated atherosclerosis; intrathoracic pressure swings → atrial stretch → AF |
| **Motor vehicle accidents** | Excessive daytime sleepiness → ↓reaction time → ↑crash risk (2–7× ↑ risk) |
| **Pulmonary hypertension** | Chronic nocturnal hypoxia → HPV → ↑PVR → RV strain |
| **Cognitive impairment and mood disturbance** | Fragmented sleep → ↓memory, ↓attention; also ↑depression and irritability |

### 9. Post-Surgical Dyspnoea and Respiratory Complications

***Post-operative complications causing dyspnoea*** are extremely high-yield [50][51]:

***Pulmonary complications*** [50]:
- ***Atelectasis*** — the commonest cause of post-op fever in the first 24–48 hours. Mechanism: anaesthesia + pain + immobility → ↓deep breathing → small airway collapse → V/Q mismatch → hypoxia
- ***Pneumonia*** — especially aspiration pneumonia (↓consciousness post-GA) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (immobility, mechanical ventilation)
- ***Bronchospasm*** — pre-existing asthma/COPD exacerbated by intubation/anaesthetic agents
- ***ARDS*** — systemic inflammation (sepsis, massive transfusion, aspiration) → diffuse alveolar damage
- ***Acute exacerbation of COPD***
- ***Pulmonary embolism*** — immobility + surgery + hypercoagulability (Virchow's triad all triggered)
- ***Respiratory failure***

***Cardiac complications*** [50]:
- ***AF*** — most common post-operative arrhythmia, especially after thoracic/oesophageal surgery (atrial irritation from surgical manipulation + sympathetic surge + electrolyte disturbances)
- ***Myocardial infarction*** — stress-induced demand ischaemia (Type 2 MI) in patients with underlying CAD

***Other post-operative causes of dyspnoea*** [51]:
- ***Post-operative haematoma*** (after thyroid surgery): ***usually in paratracheal region below strap muscles → venous obstruction → acute laryngeal oedema → risk of airway compromise; S/S: large, tense, firm immobile neck swelling + SOB; Mx: cut subcuticular stitches and stitches holding strap muscles (evacuate all blood) → call seniors for intubation*** [51]
- ***Bilateral RLN injury*** (after thyroid surgery): ***dyspnoea + stridor upon extubation → require immediate re-tube ± tracheostomy*** [51]
- ***Laryngospasm from hypocalcaemia*** (after total thyroidectomy → hypoPTH): ***severe hypoCa can lead to laryngospasm requiring emergency intubation/surgical airway*** [51]
- ***Tracheomalacia*** (after removal of large goitre): floppy tracheal wall collapses on inspiration [51]
- ***Chylothorax*** (after oesophageal surgery): thoracic duct damage → milky pleural effusion → ↓lung volume [50]

<Callout title="Post-Thyroidectomy Dyspnoea — DDx" type="error">

When a patient develops acute dyspnoea after thyroidectomy, consider these causes in order of urgency [51]:

1. **Haematoma** → neck swelling + hypovolaemic shock + laryngeal oedema → open wound immediately
2. **Bilateral RLN irritation/injury** → stridor + airway obstruction → re-intubate ± tracheostomy
3. **Laryngospasm from hypocalcaemia** → check calcium → IV calcium gluconate → intubate if needed
4. **Injury to trachea / pneumothorax** → CXR → chest drain
5. **Tracheomalacia** → floppy trachea → positive pressure ventilation ± tracheostomy

This is a classic exam question. The first step for haematoma is **open the wound at the bedside** — do NOT wait to go to theatre.

## C. Complications of Treatment Modalities

### 1. Oxygen Therapy

| Complication | Mechanism | When to Worry |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| **CO₂ narcosis in COPD** | Excessive O₂ → ↓hypoxic drive → hypoventilation → ↑CO₂ → respiratory acidosis → ↓consciousness | Always use controlled O₂ (SpO₂ 88–92%) in known/suspected CO₂ retainers |
| **Oxygen toxicity** | Prolonged high FiO₂ ( > 60% for > 24–48 h) → free radical generation → oxidative damage to alveolar epithelium → ARDS-like picture | Minimise FiO₂ to lowest level maintaining target SpO₂ |
| **Absorption atelectasis** | High FiO₂ → nitrogen washout from alveoli → ↓alveolar splinting → collapse of poorly ventilated alveoli | Especially in alveoli with low V/Q ratios |
| **Retinopathy of prematurity** | Excessive O₂ in neonates → abnormal retinal vessel proliferation | Strict O₂ monitoring in NICU |

### 2. Mechanical Ventilation (NIV and IPPV)

***Complications of mechanical ventilation*** [35]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| ***Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)*** | Endotracheal tube bypasses upper airway defences → aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions → nosocomial pneumonia | Head-of-bed elevation 30–45°, oral hygiene, subglottic suction, minimise sedation, daily sedation holidays |
| ***Barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema)*** | ***Volume-limited ventilation → ↑alveolar pressure → alveolar rupture*** [35] | Use pressure-limited ventilation; lung-protective strategy (TV 6 mL/kg IBW, plateau pressure < 30 cmH₂O) |
| ***Atelectasis*** | Inadequate PEEP → alveolar collapse; endobronchial intubation → single-lung ventilation | Appropriate PEEP; confirm ETT position (4–6 cm above carina) |
| ***Patient-ventilator asynchrony*** | ***↑SOB, ↑work of breathing, ↑duration of ventilation; causes: airway-related (ETT malposition, blocked tube), ventilator-related (circuit leak, inadequate humidification), inappropriate settings, underlying disease, complications (VAP, PTX), or anxiety/pain*** [35] | Identify and treat reversible causes; sedation if needed |
| **VILI (ventilator-induced lung injury)** | Volutrauma (overdistension), atelectrauma (cyclic opening/closing of alveoli), biotrauma (inflammatory cascade from mechanical stress) | Lung-protective ventilation: low TV, adequate PEEP |
| **Haemodynamic compromise** | Positive pressure → ↓venous return → ↓preload → ↓CO | Particularly in hypovolaemic patients; may need fluid bolus |
| **ICU-acquired weakness** | Prolonged immobility + corticosteroids + neuromuscular blocking agents → critical illness myopathy/neuropathy | Early mobilisation, minimise NMBAs, daily sedation holidays |
| **Tracheal stenosis** (late) | Prolonged ETT cuff pressure → tracheal mucosal ischaemia → fibrosis → stenosis | Monitor cuff pressure ( < 25 cmH₂O); consider tracheostomy if ventilation > 10–14 days |

### 3. Anticoagulation (for PE/DVT)

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Major bleeding** | Excessive anticoagulation → ↓clotting | For warfarin: vitamin K ± PCC/FFP; for heparin: protamine; for DOACs: specific reversal agents (idarucizumab for dabigatran, andexanet alfa for factor Xa inhibitors) |
| **Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)** | Anti-PF4/heparin antibodies → platelet activation → paradoxical thrombosis | Stop all heparin immediately; switch to non-heparin anticoagulant (argatroban, fondaparinux) |
| **Warfarin skin necrosis** | Protein C (short half-life) depleted before other factors → transient hypercoagulable state → microvascular thrombosis in skin | Bridge with heparin during warfarin initiation |

### 4. Thrombolysis (for Massive PE)

| Complication | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Intracranial haemorrhage** | ~1–3% | Strict adherence to contraindications; lower dose if possible |
| **Major extracranial bleeding** | ~5–10% | Careful patient selection; avoid in recent surgery, active bleeding |
| **Reperfusion injury** | Sudden restoration of flow → inflammatory cascade → transient worsening | Supportive care; usually self-limiting |

### 5. Bronchodilator Side Effects

| Drug | Side Effects | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Salbutamol (SABA)** | Tremor, tachycardia, hypokalaemia, palpitations | β₂ stimulation in skeletal muscle (tremor) and heart (↑HR); β₂-mediated K⁺ shift into cells |
| **Ipratropium (SAMA)** | Dry mouth, urinary retention (rare), acute glaucoma (if nebulised into eyes) | Anticholinergic effects |
| **Theophylline** | Nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, seizures, arrhythmias | Narrow therapeutic index; phosphodiesterase inhibition |

### 6. Corticosteroid Side Effects (from Chronic Use)

Relevant because many dyspnoea-causing conditions require long-term steroids (asthma, COPD, ILD):

| System | Complication | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Metabolic | Cushing syndrome, DM, weight gain | ↑Gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance, ↑appetite |
| MSK | Osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, myopathy | ↓Osteoblast activity, ↑osteoclast; ↓protein synthesis in muscle |
| Immune | Immunosuppression → infections (TB reactivation, fungal, PJP) | ↓T-cell function, ↓inflammatory response |
| GI | Peptic ulcer (esp. with NSAIDs) | ↓Prostaglandin → ↓mucosal protection |
| Adrenal | Adrenal suppression → adrenal crisis on abrupt withdrawal | Exogenous steroid → ↓ACTH → adrenal atrophy |
| Other | Cataracts, glaucoma, skin thinning, easy bruising | Multiple mechanisms |

### 7. Chest Drain Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention/Management |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Malposition** | Insertion too high/low/deep | Confirm position with CXR; use ultrasound guidance |
| **Infection / empyema** | Contamination through drain site | Aseptic technique; prophylactic antibiotics not routinely indicated |
| **Intercostal vessel injury → haemothorax** | Insertion above rib → damage to neurovascular bundle running below each rib | Always insert above the upper border of the rib below |
| ***Re-expansion pulmonary oedema*** | ***Rapid re-expansion with restoration of blood flow into compressed capillaries → capillary damage with leakage; RFs: lung collapse > 3 days, high-volume drainage, early suction use; S/S: cough, SOB, desaturation; Mx: supportive + clamp drain*** [39] |
| **Subcutaneous emphysema** | Air leak along drain tract into subcutaneous tissue | Usually self-limiting; ensure drain is functioning |
| **Organ injury** (liver, spleen, diaphragm) | Incorrect level of insertion | Safe triangle: bordered by anterior border of latissimus dorsi, lateral border of pectoralis major, line superior to the horizontal level of the nipple, and apex below the axilla |

### 8. Transfusion-Related Complications (in Anaemia Treatment)

***Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO)*** [52]:
- ***Incidence: 1/10k***
- ***Pathogenesis: due to volume overload from any blood component, usually in pre-existing HF/CKD***
- ***S/S: respiratory distress (SOB, orthopnoea) in 6–12 h of completing transfusion***
- ***D/dx from TRALI: ↑CVP with pulmonary oedema picture in TACO (cf. non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema with normal/low CVP in TRALI)***
- ***Mx: O₂, diuretics ± ventilation if hypoxia***

**Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)**:
- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema within 6 hours of transfusion
- Mechanism: donor antibodies react with recipient neutrophils → neutrophil activation → capillary leak → pulmonary oedema
- Mx: supportive (O₂, ventilation); diuretics NOT helpful (unlike TACO)

---

## D. Complications of Specific Systemic Conditions Presenting with Dyspnoea

### Systemic Sclerosis [48][53]

***Mortality: 4× general population, majority related to cardiopulmonary involvement*** [53]:
- **ILD** → progressive restrictive lung disease → respiratory failure
- **Pulmonary arterial hypertension** (10–15%) → RV failure
- ***Scleroderma renal crisis*** (10–15%): ***abrupt malignant HTN, oliguric RF → can lead to ESRD in 1–2 months or death ≤ 1 year*** [53]
- **Cardiac** involvement: myocardial fibrosis → arrhythmias → HF
- **Aspiration pneumonia**: oesophageal dysmotility → GORD → microaspiration

### Eisenmenger Syndrome [54]

***Complications*** [54]:
- ***Cardiac: progressive right heart failure, arrhythmia, IE (rare)***
- ***Pulmonary: pulmonary artery thrombosis, massive haemoptysis due to rupture of major vessel***
- ***Systemic: stunted growth from hypoxia, polycythaemia, cerebral embolism/abscess***
- ***Prognosis: 30–40% 10-year mortality with mean age of death at 37 years if transplant not done***

### DKA [55]

***Complications of DKA treatment*** — these are as important as the disease itself:

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Hypokalaemia** | Insulin drives K⁺ intracellularly; also ongoing renal K⁺ losses | Always check K⁺ before starting insulin; replace K⁺ when < 5.5 mmol/L; do NOT give insulin if K⁺ < 3.5 |
| **Hypoglycaemia** | Insulin therapy without adequate glucose monitoring | Monitor glucose hourly; add dextrose when glucose < 14 mmol/L |
| **Cerebral oedema** | Rapid correction of hyperosmolality → osmotic shift of water into brain cells | More common in children; avoid too-rapid fluid correction and too-rapid glucose drop |
| **ARDS** | Unclear; possibly related to fluid overload or pulmonary inflammation | Careful fluid management |
| **Aspiration pneumonia** | ↓Consciousness + vomiting → aspiration | NGT if altered consciousness; protect airway |

### Chronic Pancreatitis [56]

***Pancreatic ascites and pleural effusion*** [56]:
- ***Due to disruption of pancreatic duct or ruptured pseudocyst with fistulation into peritoneal/pleural cavity***
- ***S/S: abdominal distension, dyspnoea, chest pain***
- ***Dx: ↑↑amylase concentration in pleural or ascitic fluid***
- ***Mx: octreotide (↓pancreatic secretion), endoscopic stents, surgical fistula correction if fail***

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Dyspnoea → Respiratory failure → Respiratory arrest → Cardiac arrest**: this is the common final pathway of all severe dyspnoea if untreated
2. **Heart failure complications**: cardiogenic shock (downward spiral of ↓CO → ↓coronary perfusion → more ischaemia), arrhythmias, cardiorenal syndrome, thromboembolic events
3. **MI mechanical complications**: papillary muscle rupture (acute MR), VSD, free wall rupture (tamponade) — all present with acute haemodynamic collapse and new SOB
4. **PE complications**: acute RV failure (cause of death), pulmonary infarction, CTEPH (chronic complication), post-thrombotic syndrome (DVT complication)
5. **Pneumonia complications**: sepsis/MOF, empyema, lung abscess, SIADH with hypoNa, cardiac complications (AF, MI)
6. **COPD complications**: cor pulmonale, polycythaemia, pneumothorax (bullae rupture), lung cancer, respiratory failure
7. **Post-thyroidectomy dyspnoea**: haematoma → bilateral RLN injury → hypocalcaemic laryngospasm → tracheomalacia — classic exam question
8. **Mechanical ventilation complications**: VAP, barotrauma, VILI, haemodynamic compromise, tracheal stenosis, ICU-acquired weakness
9. **O₂ therapy risks**: CO₂ narcosis in COPD (too much O₂), oxygen toxicity (prolonged high FiO₂), absorption atelectasis
10. **TACO vs TRALI**: TACO = volume overload (↑CVP, pulmonary oedema, responds to diuretics); TRALI = immune-mediated capillary leak (normal CVP, diuretics not helpful)
11. **DKA treatment complications**: hypokalaemia (check K⁺ before insulin), hypoglycaemia, cerebral oedema (children)
12. **Re-expansion pulmonary oedema**: after rapid re-expansion of collapsed lung; Mx: clamp drain + supportive

The RV gradually fails under the chronic pressure overload. Presents months to years after PE with progressive exertional dyspnoea, fatigue, and eventually signs of right heart failure. Diagnosis: V/Q scan (mismatched defects) plus right heart catheterisation (mean PAP greater than 20 mmHg). Definitive treatment: pulmonary endarterectomy (surgical removal of organised thrombus from pulmonary arteries) at a specialist centre. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty and riociguat (sGC stimulator) for inoperable cases.",
