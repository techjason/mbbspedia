## Complications of Nasal Congestion and Runny Nose

Nasal congestion and rhinorrhoea are, for most patients, self-limiting nuisances. But they can serve as the entry point for a cascade of complications that range from bothersome (post-nasal drip cough) to life-threatening (intracranial abscess). The key insight is that **the nose is not an isolated organ** — it communicates directly with the paranasal sinuses, the middle ear, the orbit, the lower airways, and the intracranial cavity. Infection, inflammation, or obstruction in the nose can therefore propagate through these anatomical connections.

I'll organise complications by the primary condition causing the nasal symptoms, then by anatomical direction of spread.

### 1. Complications of Acute Viral URTI (Common Cold)

***Complications*** of viral URTI [1]:

These arise because viral infection of the nasal mucosa impairs the local defence mechanisms (mucociliary clearance, epithelial barrier, local immunity), creating opportunities for secondary bacterial infection and downstream effects.

#### 1.1 Acute Rhinosinusitis

***Acute rhinosinusitis due to ↓mucociliary clearance with viral infection of mucosa*** [1].

- **Pathophysiology**: Viral cytopathic effect on ciliated epithelium → ciliary dysfunction → impaired mucociliary transport → mucus stasis within sinuses. Simultaneously, mucosal oedema obstructs the ostiomeatal complex → trapped secretions in a poorly ventilated sinus → reduced oxygen tension and lowered pH → ideal environment for bacterial proliferation.
- **Frequency**: Radiographic evidence of sinus involvement is present in up to 87% of common colds, but only ***0.5–2% progress to bacterial rhinosinusitis*** [1].
- **Clinical significance**: Most viral sinusitis resolves spontaneously. Bacterial superinfection (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis) is suggested by double sickening, symptoms > 10 days, or severe onset [1].

#### 1.2 Acute Otitis Media

***Acute otitis media (especially in children) due to Eustachian tube dysfunction and bacterial translocation from upper respiratory tract*** [1].

- **Pathophysiology**: The Eustachian tube (ET) connects the nasopharynx to the middle ear. Viral-induced nasopharyngeal mucosal oedema → ET obstruction → negative pressure in the middle ear → fluid transudation into the middle ear space (serous otitis media). Bacteria from the nasopharynx can ascend through the dysfunctional ET → secondary bacterial infection of the effusion → acute otitis media.
- **Why children are more susceptible**: The paediatric ET is shorter, more horizontal, and more flaccid than the adult ET → less effective drainage and more susceptible to obstruction. Also, adenoid hypertrophy (common in children) physically blocks the ET orifice.
- **Clinical features**: Otalgia (ear tugging in infants), fever, irritability, red bulging tympanic membrane, conductive hearing loss.

#### 1.3 Lower Respiratory Tract Involvement

***Lower respiratory involvement due to RSV, parainfluenza, influenza involvement of lungs*** [1].

- **Pathophysiology**: Certain respiratory viruses are not confined to the upper airways. RSV and parainfluenza virus have particular tropism for lower airway epithelium → bronchiolitis (infants), bronchitis, or viral pneumonia. Influenza can cause primary viral pneumonia or predispose to secondary bacterial pneumonia (classically S. aureus, S. pneumoniae).
- **Clinical features**: Worsening cough, dyspnoea, wheezing (bronchiolitis/bronchitis), or crepitations with consolidation (pneumonia).

#### 1.4 Asthma Exacerbation

***Asthma exacerbation ?due to ↑airway hyperreactivity with local inflammation*** [1].

- **Pathophysiology**: Viral infection of airway epithelium → release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines → recruitment of eosinophils and neutrophils → airway inflammation → exaggeration of pre-existing airway hyperreactivity in asthmatics. Also, viral damage to epithelium exposes subepithelial nerve endings → heightened bronchoconstrictor reflex. Rhinovirus is the single most common trigger of asthma exacerbations in both children and adults.
- **The "united airway" concept**: The nasal and bronchial mucosa are continuous and share the same pseudostratified ciliated epithelium. Inflammation in one compartment frequently affects the other. This is why allergic rhinitis and asthma so commonly coexist, and why treating nasal disease improves asthma control.

#### 1.5 Post-Viral Cough

***Post-viral cough: commonly persists past the time nasal and throat symptoms resolve*** [1].

- **Pathophysiology**: Viral infection strips the protective epithelial layer from the airways → exposed sensory nerve endings (C-fibres) become hypersensitive to normally innocuous stimuli (cold air, talking, laughing) → heightened cough reflex. Post-nasal drip also contributes by trickling mucus onto the pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa, triggering the cough reflex via vagal afferents.
- **Duration**: Can persist for 3–8 weeks after the initial infection. This is the single most common cause of subacute cough (3–8 weeks) and is frequently misdiagnosed as bronchitis or "needing antibiotics."

### 2. Complications of Acute Rhinosinusitis

***Complications: uncommon, due to spread beyond paranasal sinuses*** [1].

These are the **high-yield, exam-critical complications**. They are uncommon ( < 3% of bacterial ARS) but potentially devastating. The sinuses are surrounded by the orbit (laterally/superiorly) and the cranial cavity (superiorly/posteriorly), separated only by thin bony walls. Infection breaches these barriers by three mechanisms:
1. **Direct extension** through thin bone (e.g., lamina papyracea, posterior wall of frontal sinus)
2. **Thrombophlebitis** of valveless diploic veins (Breschet veins) that communicate between sinus mucosa and intracranial/orbital venous systems
3. **Osteomyelitis** with bony destruction

#### 2.1 Facial Complications

***Facial: facial cellulitis, osteomyelitis of sinus bones (Pott's puffy tumour)*** [1].

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Facial cellulitis** | Direct spread of infection from sinus mucosa through bone to overlying soft tissues | Erythema, warmth, swelling, tenderness overlying the affected sinus (usually maxillary or frontal) | IV antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate or ceftriaxone) |
| **Pott's puffy tumour** | **Osteomyelitis of the frontal bone** → subperiosteal abscess of the forehead. Despite the name, it is NOT a tumour — "puffy" describes the soft, doughy swelling. Named after Sir Percivall Pott (18th century surgeon) | Tender, fluctuant forehead swelling ("peau d'orange" overlying skin), fever, frontal headache. Most common in adolescents (frontal sinus is actively developing/pneumatising, with rich diploic blood supply) | IV antibiotics + surgical drainage of subperiosteal abscess + often frontal sinus drainage (Draf procedure or trephine) |

> **Why is Pott's puffy tumour more common in adolescents?** Because the frontal sinus completes pneumatisation during adolescence, and the developing diploic bone has a particularly rich blood supply that facilitates haematogenous spread of infection from the sinus mucoperiosteum to the outer table of the frontal bone.

#### 2.2 Orbital Complications (Chandler Classification)

***Orbit: preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess*** [1][13].

The orbit is separated from the **ethmoid sinus** by the **lamina papyracea** ("papyrus-like plate") — a paper-thin bone that is often dehiscent (has natural perforations for neurovascular passage). This is why ethmoid sinusitis is the most common source of orbital complications.

The **Chandler Classification** grades orbital complications by severity:

| Stage | Name | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features | Key Distinction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| I | **Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis** | Infection of eyelid tissues **anterior to the orbital septum**. The orbital septum is a fibrous barrier between the eyelid and the orbit | Eyelid swelling, erythema, warmth. **Normal eye movements, normal vision, no proptosis** | ***Not an emergency*** [13] — because the infection is confined to the eyelid and does not threaten the eye or brain |
| II | **Orbital cellulitis** | Infection has spread **posterior to the orbital septum** into the orbital fat/tissues. Diffuse inflammation of orbital contents | ***Proptosis, ophthalmoplegia ± diplopia (most important feature), pain with eye movement, ± visual impairment ± RAPD, chemosis, fever*** [13] | ***Ophthalmic emergency*** [13] — can progress to abscess, visual loss, or intracranial spread |
| III | **Subperiosteal abscess** | Pus collects between the periorbita and the lamina papyracea (between the orbital wall bone and the orbital periosteum) | As above but often with displacement of the globe (laterally and inferiorly if medial wall abscess from ethmoid source), more severe proptosis | Requires **urgent surgical drainage** in addition to IV antibiotics [13] |
| IV | **Orbital abscess** | Discrete abscess within the orbital fat, posterior to the septum | Severe proptosis, complete ophthalmoplegia, marked visual loss, severe constitutional symptoms | Urgent surgical drainage + IV antibiotics |
| V | **Cavernous sinus thrombosis** | Infection spreads via valveless superior ophthalmic vein to cavernous sinus → septic thrombosis | **Bilateral** eye signs (because the cavernous sinuses communicate via intercavernous sinuses), CN III/IV/V1/V2/VI palsies, altered consciousness, high fever, rapid deterioration | Life-threatening emergency. IV antibiotics + anticoagulation (controversial) + possibly surgical drainage |

***Orbital cellulitis is an ophthalmic emergency*** [13]. The complications of orbital cellulitis include:
- ***Subperiosteal abscess (15–59%)*** [13]
- ***Orbital abscess (24%)*** [13]
- ***Intracranial extension: cavernous sinus thrombosis/CVST, brain abscess, epidural/subdural empyema*** [13]
- ***Visual loss due to optic neuritis or ischaemia due to compressive CRAO or orbital venous thrombophlebitis*** [13]

**Why does orbital cellulitis cause visual loss?** Two mechanisms:
1. **Compressive optic neuropathy**: swollen orbital contents compress the optic nerve directly → ischaemia → optic neuropathy (RAPD on examination).
2. **Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)**: raised intraorbital pressure exceeds retinal arterial perfusion pressure → retinal ischaemia → sudden painless visual loss.

<Callout title="Preseptal vs. Orbital Cellulitis — The Exam Classic" type="error">
The most critical distinction in the exam: **preseptal cellulitis has NORMAL eye movements and NORMAL vision** — it is a mild condition treated with oral antibiotics. **Orbital cellulitis has ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, and threatens vision** — it is an emergency requiring IV antibiotics and often surgical drainage. The key question at the bedside: "Can the patient move their eye in all directions? Is the vision affected?" [13]
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Intracranial Complications

***Intracranial: meningitis, intracranial abscess, septic cavernous sinus thrombosis*** [1].

These are the most feared complications of rhinosinusitis. They occur when infection breaches the posterior wall of the frontal sinus, the roof of the ethmoid sinus (fovea ethmoidalis), or spreads via valveless veins.

| Complication | Source Sinus | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features | Key Investigations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bacterial meningitis** | Any, esp. sphenoid, ethmoid | Direct extension through skull base or haematogenous spread → infection of meninges | Headache, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, altered consciousness. ***Complications of meningitis: basal meningeal adhesions → hydrocephalus, CN palsies (III, IV, VI commonest); arteritis/thrombophlebitis → cerebral infarction; parenchymal damage → seizures, intellectual impairment*** [14] | LP (after CT if focal signs), blood cultures, CT sinuses |
| **Epidural abscess** | Frontal (most common) | Infection penetrates posterior table of frontal sinus → pus collects between dura and inner skull table | Fever, headache, focal neurological signs (depending on location). May be clinically silent initially | CT/MRI with contrast → rim-enhancing collection |
| **Subdural empyema** | Frontal, ethmoid | Pus between dura and arachnoid mater. Rapidly progressive and extremely dangerous | Rapid deterioration: high fever, severe headache, seizures, hemiparesis, raised ICP signs. ***Look for severe headache, protracted vomiting, CN palsies and mental status changes*** [13] | MRI with contrast (superior to CT) → crescentic collection. Mortality ~10–20% even with treatment |
| **Brain abscess** | Frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid | Direct extension or haematogenous seeding → focal collection of pus within brain parenchyma, usually frontal lobe (from frontal sinusitis) | Headache, fever (may be absent), focal neurological deficits, seizures, raised ICP | CT/MRI with contrast → ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding oedema. ***Intracranial tumour, chronic subdural haematoma show similar imaging findings*** [11] |
| **Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST)** | Sphenoid (direct adjacency), ethmoid, or via ophthalmic veins | Infection spreads to cavernous sinus → septic thrombosis → obstruction of venous drainage from orbits and cranial nerves within the sinus | Bilateral proptosis, bilateral ophthalmoplegia (CN III, IV, VI traverse the cavernous sinus), CN V1/V2 sensory loss, high fever, altered consciousness, rapid deterioration | MRI/MRV or CT venography → non-enhancing/filling defect in cavernous sinus. Blood cultures. Mortality 20–30% |

> **Why do intracranial complications of sinusitis spread via veins rather than arteries?** Because the diploic veins (within the skull bones) and the emissary veins connecting the sinuses to the intracranial venous sinuses are **valveless**. This means blood (and therefore bacteria/infected thrombi) can flow in either direction — from sinus mucosa directly into the dural venous sinuses. There is no one-way valve to prevent retrograde spread. This is a fundamental anatomical concept.

<Callout title="When to Suspect Intracranial Complications of Sinusitis">
Red flags during treatment of acute sinusitis that should trigger **urgent CT/MRI and neurosurgical consultation**:
- High spiking fever not responding to appropriate antibiotics
- Severe or worsening headache out of proportion to sinus symptoms
- Altered mental status (drowsiness, confusion, agitation)
- Focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia)
- Seizures
- Signs of raised ICP (vomiting, papilloedema, CN VI palsy)
- Bilateral orbital signs (suggesting cavernous sinus involvement)
</Callout>

### 3. Complications of Chronic Rhinosinusitis

#### 3.1 Mucocoele

- **Pathophysiology**: Complete obstruction of a sinus ostium → entrapped mucous secretion → progressive expansion of the sinus as the mucocoele slowly expands under the pressure of accumulating mucus → erosion of surrounding bone (pressure necrosis) → extension into orbit (proptosis, diplopia) or intracranial cavity.
- **Most common site**: Frontal sinus (60–65%), then ethmoid.
- **Clinical features**: Slowly progressive unilateral proptosis (downward and lateral globe displacement if frontal mucocoele), periorbital fullness, frontal headache. If secondarily infected → **mucopyocoele** (acute presentation with pain, fever).
- **Imaging**: CT shows expanded, opacified sinus with thinning/erosion of bony walls. MRI differentiates from tumour.
- **Management**: Surgical drainage/marsupialisation via endoscopic approach.

#### 3.2 Chronic Mucosal Disease and Polyp Formation

- **Pathophysiology**: Persistent inflammation → mucosal remodelling → goblet cell hyperplasia, submucosal fibrosis, and oedematous polypoid degeneration (in Type 2 CRS). This creates a self-perpetuating cycle: polyps obstruct drainage → more stasis → more inflammation → more polyps.
- **Clinical impact**: Progressive bilateral nasal obstruction, anosmia (polyps block olfactory cleft), recurrent infections, reduced quality of life.

#### 3.3 Anosmia / Hyposmia

- **Conductive anosmia**: Nasal polyps or severe mucosal oedema physically block odorant molecules from reaching the olfactory neuroepithelium in the roof of the nose. This is reversible with effective medical or surgical treatment.
- **Sensorineural anosmia**: Chronic inflammation may damage the olfactory neuroepithelium itself over time, or post-viral olfactory nerve damage (especially with COVID-19, influenza). This is less reversible.
- **Impact**: Often underestimated — anosmia affects taste (flavour perception depends ~80% on olfaction), food safety (cannot smell gas leaks, smoke, spoiled food), and quality of life (depression, social isolation).

### 4. Complications of Allergic Rhinitis

#### 4.1 The Atopic March

***Atopic march: atopic dermatitis/food allergy (0–3y) → asthma (4–9y) → rhinoconjunctivitis (10+ y)*** [3].

- **Pathophysiology**: Allergic rhinitis is part of a systemic Th2-polarised immune dysregulation. The same genetic and immunological predisposition that drives nasal mucosal IgE sensitisation also affects bronchial mucosa (asthma), skin (eczema), and gut (food allergy). ***Early-onset atopic dermatitis is associated with ↑risk of progression into other forms of atopic conditions*** [3].
- **Clinical significance**: Treating AR aggressively (especially with allergen immunotherapy) may modulate the atopic march — there is evidence that AIT reduces the risk of developing asthma in children with AR.

#### 4.2 Asthma

- The "united airway" hypothesis: allergic rhinitis and asthma represent inflammation of the same continuous airway mucosa. Up to 40% of AR patients have asthma, and > 80% of asthmatics have AR.
- Uncontrolled AR worsens asthma control. Treating AR (especially with INCS) improves asthma outcomes.

#### 4.3 Otitis Media with Effusion (OME / "Glue Ear")

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic allergic nasopharyngeal mucosal oedema → Eustachian tube dysfunction → negative middle ear pressure → serous fluid accumulation in the middle ear.
- **Clinical impact**: Conductive hearing loss → speech and language delay in young children if untreated. Managed with treating the underlying AR; myringotomy ± grommets if persistent.

#### 4.4 Allergic Conjunctivitis

- Up to 60–70% of AR patients have concurrent allergic conjunctivitis (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis). Driven by the same IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation in the conjunctival mucosa.
- ***Usually associated with other atopic features: sneezing, rhinorrhoea, eczema*** [7].

#### 4.5 Sleep Disturbance and Quality of Life Impact

- Chronic nasal congestion (especially at night — worse when supine due to gravity-dependent venous pooling) disrupts sleep architecture → daytime fatigue, impaired concentration, reduced school/work performance.
- Children with chronic AR have impaired cognitive function and school performance comparable to that seen with chronic illness.

#### 4.6 Dental and Craniofacial Effects (Children)

- Chronic mouth breathing from nasal obstruction → altered craniofacial development:
  - **Adenoid facies**: elongated face, high-arched palate, dental malocclusion, open-mouth posture
  - **Dental caries**: mouth breathing dries the oral mucosa → reduced salivary buffering → ↑caries risk

---

### 5. Complications of Rhinitis Medicamentosa

***Drugs: topical OTC → rhinitis medicamentosa*** [4].

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Rebound congestion (the defining feature)** | α-receptor downregulation → withdrawal vasodilatation → worse congestion than the original disease |
| **Mucosal atrophy and metaplasia** | Chronic vasoconstriction → ischaemic damage to nasal mucosa → loss of cilia, squamous metaplasia, submucosal fibrosis |
| **Psychological dependence** | Patients become psychologically dependent on the spray because any attempt to stop causes intolerable congestion. This is a real and significant barrier to treatment |
| **Epistaxis** | Atrophic, fragile mucosa bleeds easily with minor trauma (nose blowing, digital manipulation) |

---

### 6. Complications of Nasal Trauma

***Trauma ± blood*** [4].

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Septal haematoma** | Blunt nasal trauma → bleeding between the perichondrium and septal cartilage. The haematoma strips perichondrium from cartilage → loss of blood supply to avascular cartilage → **avascular necrosis** | An ENT emergency. If not drained within 24–72 hours → abscess formation → septal perforation → saddle nose deformity. Always examine the septum after any nasal trauma |
| **CSF rhinorrhoea** | Fracture of the cribriform plate (anterior skull base) → meningeal tear → CSF leaks into nasal cavity. ***Clear discharge following direct facial or head injury may represent CSF leakage from a skull fracture*** [4] | Risk of ascending meningitis if not treated. Confirm with β2-transferrin. Neurosurgical repair if persistent |
| **Nasal fracture with cosmetic deformity** | Displacement of nasal bones → visible deviation, dorsal hump, or depression | Closed reduction within 10–14 days (before bone healing); open septorhinoplasty if late presentation |

---

### 7. Complications of Nasal Foreign Body

***Nasal foreign body e.g. in toddlers*** [4].

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Secondary infection** | Foreign body obstructs mucociliary clearance → stagnant mucus → bacterial overgrowth (often anaerobes) → unilateral foul-smelling purulent/bloody discharge |
| **Mucosal ulceration and granulation tissue** | Chronic mechanical irritation of the nasal mucosa by the foreign body → ulceration → granulation tissue formation that may obscure the foreign body on examination |
| **Button battery necrosis** | Button batteries are particularly dangerous — they generate an electrical current when in contact with moist mucosa → **liquefactive necrosis** within 2–4 hours → rapid septal perforation, turbinate destruction. This is a **true emergency** requiring immediate removal |
| **Aspiration** | Failed or poorly planned removal attempts may push the foreign body posteriorly → aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree |
| **Rhinolith formation** | If a foreign body remains in situ for months-years, mineral salts (calcium, magnesium) deposit around it → forms a rhinolith (nasal stone) → chronic unilateral obstruction and infection |

<Callout title="Button Battery in the Nose — Time is Tissue!" type="error">
A button battery lodged in the nose is a **surgical emergency**. Liquefactive necrosis begins within hours and can cause septal perforation within 4 hours. Do NOT wait for specialist review — remove immediately if at all possible. This also applies to button batteries in the oesophagus (oesophageal perforation risk).
</Callout>

### 8. Complications of Chronic Nasal Obstruction (Any Cause)

These are the "downstream effects" of prolonged nasal breathing impairment, regardless of the underlying aetiology:

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)** | Chronic nasal obstruction increases upper airway resistance → contributes to pharyngeal collapse during sleep → apnoeas/hypopnoeas → intermittent hypoxia → daytime somnolence, cardiovascular risk |
| **Eustachian tube dysfunction / OME** | Nasopharyngeal obstruction (polyps, adenoids, tumour) → impaired ET opening → negative middle ear pressure → effusion |
| **Oral breathing complications** | Chronic mouth breathing → dry mouth (xerostomia) → ↑dental caries, halitosis, gingivitis. In children → adenoid facies, dental malocclusion |
| **Lower airway disease** | Loss of nasal air conditioning (warming, humidifying, filtering) → cold, dry, unfiltered air reaches lower airways → bronchial hyperreactivity, ↑infection risk, asthma worsening |
| **Chronic cough (post-nasal drip syndrome / upper airway cough syndrome)** | Mucus dripping from posterior nose onto pharyngeal and laryngeal mucosa → stimulates cough receptors (vagal afferents) → chronic cough. One of the three most common causes of chronic cough (alongside asthma and GERD) |

---

### 9. Complications Summary — Organised by Direction of Spread

This is the most systematic way to think about complications in an exam:

| Direction | Source → Destination | Complications |
|---|---|---|
| **Local** | Nasal cavity itself | Rhinitis medicamentosa, mucosal atrophy, anosmia, epistaxis, polyp formation, mucocoele |
| **Lateral** | Sinuses → orbit (via lamina papyracea) | ***Preseptal cellulitis, orbital cellulitis, subperiosteal abscess, orbital abscess*** [1][13] |
| **Superior** | Sinuses → intracranial cavity (via skull base) | ***Meningitis, epidural abscess, subdural empyema, brain abscess*** [1][14] |
| **Posterior** | Sinuses → cavernous sinus (via valveless veins) | ***Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis*** [1] |
| **Anterior** | Sinuses → overlying facial soft tissues/bone | ***Facial cellulitis, Pott's puffy tumour*** [1] |
| **Inferior** | Nose → nasopharynx → Eustachian tube → middle ear | Acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion [1] |
| **Inferior (airway)** | Nose → lower airways | Lower respiratory infection, asthma exacerbation, post-nasal drip cough [1] |
| **Systemic** | Allergic rhinitis → systemic atopy | Asthma, eczema, food allergy (atopic march) [3] |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications">

The same immunological mechanism (Type I hypersensitivity with mast cell degranulation) affects different mucosal surfaces progressively. Allergic rhinitis is often the final expression of this march. Early-onset atopic dermatitis is associated with increased risk of later developing AR and asthma. Treating AR aggressively with allergen immunotherapy may modulate this progression."
