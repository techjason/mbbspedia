## Complications of Constipation

Constipation is often dismissed as a trivial complaint, but untreated or chronic constipation can produce a cascade of complications — some merely uncomfortable, others genuinely life-threatening. The key to understanding these complications is recognising that constipation creates **two fundamental pathological states**: (1) **hard, retained stool** that directly damages the anorectal mucosa and accumulates in the colon, and (2) **chronic straining** that generates **persistently raised intra-abdominal pressure**. Nearly every complication flows from one or both of these mechanisms.

---

### 1. Local Anorectal Complications

These arise from the **direct mechanical effect** of hard stool on the anal canal and perianal tissues, and from the **repeated straining** that accompanies difficult evacuation.

#### 1.1 Haemorrhoids

- **Mechanism**: Chronic straining → ↑intra-abdominal pressure → ↑venous engorgement of the anal vascular cushions (located at 3, 7, 11 o'clock in lithotomy position). Simultaneously, repeated shearing forces during passage of hard stools cause **degeneration of the supporting fibroelastic tissue and smooth muscle** (Treitz's muscle) → the cushions displace caudally → prolapse and further engorgement [25]
- **Clinical presentation**: painless bright red PR bleeding (blood coating stool or on toilet paper — "outlet-type" bleeding), prolapsing perianal mass, pruritus ani from mucous discharge. Pain occurs only with **thrombosis** or **strangulation** of prolapsed haemorrhoids [25]
- **Grading** (internal haemorrhoids) [25]:
  - Grade I: bleed but do not prolapse
  - Grade II: prolapse on defecation but reduce spontaneously
  - Grade III: prolapse and require manual reduction
  - Grade IV: permanently prolapsed, irreducible
- **Prevention**: treating the constipation (↑fibre, ↑fluid, avoid straining) is the single most important measure to prevent haemorrhoidal disease

> ***"Bleeding suggests cancer, haemorrhoids, diverticular disorder and inflammatory bowel disease"*** [1]. Always consider haemorrhoids in a constipated patient with PR bleeding — but never assume bleeding is "just haemorrhoids" without excluding more serious causes.

#### 1.2 Anal Fissure

- **Mechanism**: passage of a large, hard stool → **mechanical tearing** of the anoderm (the delicate squamous epithelium below the dentate line) → acute fissure. The tear then causes **reflex spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS)** → ↓blood flow to the posterior midline (watershed zone) → ischaemia → impaired healing → the fissure becomes chronic [26]
- This creates a **vicious cycle**: fissure → pain on defecation → fear-avoidance (patient delays defecation) → stool accumulates and hardens further → next defecation tears the fissure open again → worsening pain → more avoidance
- **Location**: posterior midline in ~90% of cases (because the posterior commissure has the poorest blood supply — the terminal branches of the inferior rectal artery reach this area last) [26]
- **Chronic fissure features**: raised edges exposing white fibres of IAS at base, hypertrophied anal papilla proximally, sentinel skin tag distally [26]
- ***"Hx of constipation → severe sharp pain upon defecation"*** [4] — a classic association

#### 1.3 Rectal Prolapse

- **Mechanism**: chronic straining → repetitive ↑intra-abdominal pressure → weakening of the pelvic floor muscles (levator ani, particularly puborectalis) and their fascial attachments → the rectum "slides" through the pelvic floor and protrudes through the anus [6]
- **Types**: partial (mucosal only) vs complete (full-thickness, circumferential)
- Once prolapse occurs, it further compromises the anal sphincter mechanism → **faecal incontinence** (75% of patients with rectal prolapse) and paradoxically worsening constipation (obstructed defecation from the prolapsing tissue) [6]
- Risk factors include ***chronic straining, chronic constipation***, elderly females, multiparity, pelvic floor dysfunction [6]

#### 1.4 Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome (SRUS)

- **Mechanism**: chronic straining and excessive pelvic floor contraction → direct mucosal trauma from repeated forceful contact of the anterior rectal wall against the contracted puborectalis muscle, combined with ischaemia from mucosal prolapse and compression
- **Histology**: characteristic thickened mucosal layer, fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria, distortion of crypt architecture
- **Clinical features**: rectal bleeding, mucus discharge, tenesmus, and perineal pain — often misdiagnosed as IBD or malignancy until biopsy clarifies
- Strongly associated with dyssynergic defecation and rectal intussusception

---

### 2. Colonic and Intestinal Complications

These arise from the **chronic accumulation of faecal matter** within the colon and the **↑intraluminal pressure** generated by straining against a loaded, non-propulsive colon.

#### 2.1 Faecal Impaction and Overflow Incontinence

- **Mechanism**: chronic constipation → large, hard faecal mass accumulates in the rectum → the rectum distends chronically → **rectal stretch receptors accommodate** (desensitise) → the patient loses the urge to defecate → more stool accumulates → the mass becomes rock-hard and too large to evacuate voluntarily
- **Overflow incontinence** (paradoxical diarrhoea): liquid stool from above the impacted mass **seeps around** the obstruction and leaks out of the anus → the patient reports "diarrhoea" when they are actually severely constipated
- **Populations at risk**: elderly, demented, bedbound, institutionalised patients; psychiatric patients; children with behavioural constipation (encopresis)
- **Complications of impaction itself**:
  - **Stercoral ulceration**: pressure necrosis of the colonic mucosa from a hard faecal mass → mucosal ulceration, typically in the sigmoid or rectum. Can progress to **stercoral perforation** — a surgical emergency with high mortality (~30–50%)
  - **Intestinal obstruction**: massive faecal impaction can cause complete large bowel obstruction [15]
  - **Urinary retention (AROU)**: faecal loading in the rectum compresses the bladder neck and prostatic urethra → precipitates urinary retention, particularly in men with background BPH [22][23]

<Callout title="Constipation as a Precipitant of AROU" type="idea">
***Constipation*** is listed as a common **precipitating factor** for acute retention of urine [22][23]. In men with background prostatic enlargement, the loaded rectum presses against the posterior bladder wall and prostatic urethra, tipping a borderline situation into frank retention. ***"Treat reversible causes: stop offending drugs, treat constipation (e.g. fleet enema) and UTI"*** [22]. Relieving constipation can restore voiding without further intervention.
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Acquired Megacolon and Megarectum

- ***Acquired megacolon*** [1] — a complication of longstanding chronic constipation
- **Mechanism**: years of faecal retention → progressive colonic dilatation → loss of effective peristalsis (Laplace's law: as radius ↑, wall tension ↑ for the same pressure, but the ability to generate propulsive pressure ↓ because muscle fibres are overstretched beyond optimal length). Simultaneously, chronic rectal distension → **rectal hyposensitivity** → ever-larger volumes needed to trigger defecation urge → vicious cycle
- Defined as colonic diameter > 6.5 cm on imaging (or rectum > 6.5 cm on lateral radiograph)
- **Consequences**: intractable constipation refractory to medical therapy; may require subtotal colectomy in severe cases
- Distinguished from **congenital megacolon** (Hirschsprung disease) by the presence of ganglion cells on biopsy and absence of a transition zone

#### 2.3 Sigmoid Volvulus

- **Mechanism**: chronic faecal overloading from constipation → **elongation and dilatation of the sigmoid colon** → the already redundant sigmoid (with its narrow mesenteric attachment) becomes even more mobile → predisposed to **twisting around its mesenteric axis** [6][27]
- Constipation is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for sigmoid volvulus [27]
- Once torsion exceeds 180°, there is luminal obstruction; beyond 360°, there is mesenteric vascular occlusion → ischaemia → gangrene → perforation [27]
- **Clinical features**: acute onset colicky abdominal pain, massive abdominal distension, absolute constipation (obstipation), vomiting (late) [27]
- **AXR**: classic ***coffee bean sign*** — dilated ahaustral sigmoid loop arising from the pelvis, with 3 lines of sigmoid wall converging to the site of obstruction [27]
- Risk factors: ***bedbound, high-fibre diet (bulky stool), chronic constipation, laxative abuse*** [27]

#### 2.4 Diverticular Disease

- **Mechanism**: ***bowel weakening with aging + increased intraluminal pressure*** (from chronic straining with constipation) → outpouching of mucosa and submucosa at the weakest points of the colonic wall (where ***vasa recta penetrate the circular muscle***) → formation of **false diverticula** [10]
- The sigmoid colon is most commonly affected in Western populations because it has the **narrowest lumen** → generates the **highest intraluminal pressure** by Laplace's law [10]
- Constipation both **causes** diverticulosis (through ↑intraluminal pressure) and **results from** complicated diverticular disease (through fibrotic stricture formation from chronic diverticulitis)
- **Complications of diverticular disease** [10][28]:
  - Diverticulitis: clinical triad of ***lower abdominal pain (RLQ in Asia) + fever + leucocytosis*** [10]
  - Diverticular bleeding: ***painless massive PR bleeding*** (rupture of vasa recta) [10]
  - Perforation → peritonitis (classified by Hinchey staging) [28]
  - Abscess formation [28]
  - Fistula: most commonly **colovesical** (pneumaturia, faecaluria, recurrent dysuria) [10][28]
  - Intestinal obstruction: LBO from fibrosis and stricture [10]

#### 2.5 Intestinal Obstruction from Faecal Impaction

- Severe faecal impaction can cause **large bowel obstruction** — this is a distinct entity from mechanical obstruction by tumour or stricture
- **Mechanism**: the faecal mass becomes so large and hard that it physically occludes the colonic lumen, typically in the rectosigmoid
- Clinical features mirror those of any LBO: ***colicky abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting (late), absolute constipation*** [15]
- On AXR: ***multiple faecal densities throughout colon/rectum*** [15]
- Management: disimpaction (manual + enemas + high-volume PEG washout), NOT surgical unless peritonitis/perforation suspected

### 3. Extra-Intestinal Complications

Chronic constipation and the associated ↑intra-abdominal pressure have systemic effects that extend well beyond the GI tract.

#### 3.1 Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

- **Mechanism**: chronic straining → ***↑intra-abdominal pressure*** → overwhelms the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) → gastric content refluxes into the oesophagus [9]
- Constipation is listed as a contributing factor to GERD alongside pregnancy, obesity, and chronic cough [9]
- Over time, this can lead to oesophagitis, Barrett's oesophagus, and peptic stricture

#### 3.2 Urinary Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:------------|:---------|
| **Acute retention of urine (AROU)** | Faecal loading compresses the bladder neck/prostatic urethra, particularly in men with BPH → precipitates retention [22][23]. ***"Constipation is usually NOT a standalone aetiology of AROU but more often a precipitating factor with background prostatic enlargement"*** [23] |
| **Urinary incontinence (stress type)** | Chronic straining → ↑intra-abdominal pressure → can overwhelm a weakened urethral sphincter, particularly in women with pelvic floor laxity → stress urinary incontinence [29] |
| **Urinary tract infection** | Faecal impaction → incomplete bladder emptying (mechanical compression) → urinary stasis → bacterial colonisation |
| **Recurrent UTI in children** | Constipation is one of the most common causes of recurrent UTI in children — the loaded rectum compresses the bladder, impairing complete emptying |

#### 3.3 Hernias

- **Mechanism**: chronic straining → ***↑intra-abdominal pressure*** → forces peritoneal contents through weak points in the abdominal wall [12]
- Constipation is a well-recognised risk factor for inguinal hernia, femoral hernia, and incisional hernia [12]
- Inguinal hernia specifically: ↑pressure pushes abdominal contents through the inguinal canal (indirect) or through Hesselbach's triangle (direct)

#### 3.4 Varicose Veins

- **Mechanism**: chronic straining → ***↑intra-abdominal pressure*** → transmitted retrograde to the lower limb venous system → ↑venous pressure → progressive dilatation of superficial veins with valvular incompetence [13]
- ***Increased abdominal pressure such as chronic cough and constipation*** is listed as a risk factor for varicose veins [13]

#### 3.5 Pelvic Organ Prolapse (in Women)

- **Mechanism**: chronic straining → repetitive ↑intra-abdominal pressure + weakening of pelvic floor muscles and fascia → descent of pelvic organs: uterine prolapse, cystocele, rectocele, enterocele
- Bidirectional relationship: constipation causes pelvic floor weakening → prolapse occurs → prolapse worsens constipation (rectocele traps stool, cystocele alters pelvic dynamics)

---

### 4. Metabolic and Systemic Complications

#### 4.1 Hepatic Encephalopathy (in Cirrhotic Patients)

- **Mechanism**: constipation in a patient with cirrhosis is particularly dangerous because it increases the **intestinal transit time** → ↑time for colonic bacteria to produce **ammonia** (NH₃) from dietary protein and urea → ↑NH₃ absorption into the portal circulation → the cirrhotic liver cannot metabolise the NH₃ via the urea cycle → NH₃ crosses the blood-brain barrier → astrocyte swelling and neurotoxicity → hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
- ***Constipation*** is listed as a **precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy** [30]
- This is why **lactulose** (a laxative) is the first-line treatment for HE — it works by two mechanisms: (1) osmotic laxative effect → ↑frequency of bowel movements → ↓transit time → ↓NH₃ production and absorption; (2) acidification of colonic pH → converts NH₃ (absorbable) to NH₄⁺ (non-absorbable, trapped in the lumen and excreted) [30]
- **Clinical pearl**: the target for lactulose in HE is **2–4 soft bowel movements per day** — too little is ineffective, too much causes dehydration and hypokalaemia

<Callout title="Constipation Precipitates Hepatic Encephalopathy">
In a cirrhotic patient who becomes confused or drowsy, always check for constipation as a precipitating factor [30]. The management is straightforward: oral lactulose (or lactulose enema if unable to take orally) titrated to 2–4 stools/day + identify and treat any other precipitants (GI bleeding, infection, over-diuresis, drugs). This is a high-yield exam scenario.
</Callout>

#### 4.2 Electrolyte Disturbances from Laxative Misuse

- **Mechanism**: patients who self-treat constipation with excessive laxatives (particularly stimulant laxatives) can develop:
  - **Hypokalaemia**: stimulant laxatives ↑colonic K⁺ secretion + watery diarrhoea from overdosing → K⁺ loss [31]
  - **Hyponatraemia**: excessive water loss in stool relative to Na⁺ in severe diarrhoea from laxative overuse
  - **Metabolic acidosis**: loss of HCO₃⁻ in stool (the colon secretes HCO₃⁻ in exchange for Cl⁻)
  - **Dehydration**: excessive fluid loss in stool
- ***Stimulant laxative: hypoNa/K, metabolic acidosis, chronic constipation, melanosis coli*** [31]
- A vicious cycle: laxative abuse → electrolyte derangement (especially hypokalaemia) → hypokalaemia itself causes constipation → patient takes more laxatives → worsening derangement

#### 4.3 Psychosocial Impact

- Chronic constipation significantly impairs **quality of life** — comparable to other chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease
- Patients report anxiety about bowel habits, social embarrassment, restricted activities, reduced productivity
- Bidirectional relationship with ***depression*** [1]: constipation worsens mood, and depression worsens constipation
- In the elderly, chronic constipation is associated with increased healthcare utilisation, nursing home placement, and ↑mortality (likely a marker of overall frailty rather than a direct cause)

### 5. Complications in Special Populations

#### 5.1 Paediatric — Encopresis and Behavioural Consequences

- **Encopresis**: faecal soiling (involuntary passage of stool into underwear) in children > 4 years, most commonly due to **overflow incontinence** from chronic constipation with faecal impaction
- **Mechanism**: chronic faecal retention → megarectum → rectal hyposensitivity → child loses awareness of urge → liquid stool leaks around the impacted mass
- **Consequences**: social stigma, bullying, school avoidance, anxiety, depression — significant psychosocial impact on the child and family
- Management: **disimpaction** first (PEG at high dose), then **maintenance** (PEG at low dose for ≥6 months), behavioural modification (regular toilet sitting after meals, positive reinforcement), and gradual weaning

#### 5.2 Hirschsprung-Associated Enterocolitis (HAEC)

- The ***most severe and lethal complication*** of Hirschsprung disease [5]
- **Mechanism**: aganglionic segment → functional obstruction → faecal stasis → bacterial overgrowth → bacterial translocation through oedematous mucosa → enterocolitis → can progress to **toxic megacolon**, perforation, septic shock, and death [5]
- Can occur **before surgery, in the immediate postoperative period, or years after definitive repair** [5]
- Risk factors: delayed diagnosis of HD > 1 week, longer aganglionic segment, Trisomy 21, associated anomalies [5]
- **Management**: IV fluids, IV antibiotics, repeated rectal irrigations with saline, diverting ileostomy/colostomy if refractory [5]

#### 5.3 Post-Stroke and Immobilised Patients

- ***Bowel output: high fibre diet + stool softener (NOT laxative) → avoid constipation, fecal impaction, soiling*** [24]
- Untreated constipation in stroke patients can lead to faecal impaction → overflow incontinence → skin breakdown (perineal dermatitis) → pressure sores → infection
- Autonomic dysreflexia in patients with spinal cord injury above T6: faecal impaction or rectal distension can trigger a dangerous hypertensive crisis through uncontrolled sympathetic reflex below the level of the lesion

      question: "How does chronic constipation predispose to both diverticular disease AND sigmoid volvulus? Explain the distinct mechanisms.",
      markscheme: "Diverticular disease: chronic straining increases intraluminal pressure, especially in the sigmoid (narrowest lumen, highest pressure by Laplace's law), causing mucosal herniation at weakest points where vasa recta penetrate circular muscle. Sigmoid volvulus: chronic faecal overloading causes elongation and dilatation of the sigmoid colon; combined with a narrow mesenteric attachment, the loaded mobile sigmoid is predisposed to torsion around its mesenteric axis."

      question: "Why is constipation a precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotic patients? How does lactulose address this?",
      markscheme: "Constipation increases intestinal transit time, allowing more time for colonic bacteria to produce ammonia from protein/urea. Increased NH3 absorption into portal circulation overwhelms the cirrhotic liver's impaired urea cycle. NH3 crosses BBB causing astrocyte swelling and neurotoxicity. Lactulose works by: (1) osmotic laxative effect reducing transit time and decreasing NH3 production/absorption, (2) acidifying colonic pH converting absorbable NH3 to non-absorbable NH4+ which is trapped in the lumen and excreted. Target: 2-4 soft stools per day."

      question: "An 82-year-old nursing home resident with BPH develops acute urinary retention. On examination, the rectum is loaded with hard stool. Explain the pathophysiological link and outline the initial management.",
      markscheme: "Pathophysiology: faecal loading in the rectum compresses the bladder neck and prostatic urethra posteriorly. In a patient with background BPH (already narrowed prostatic urethra), this additional compression tips the balance into frank retention. Constipation is a precipitating factor not a standalone cause. Initial management: (1) Urethral catheterisation for bladder decompression; (2) Fleet enema or manual disimpaction to relieve constipation; (3) Start alpha-blocker for BPH; (4) Start maintenance laxative (PEG); (5) Monitor for post-obstructive diuresis; (6) Plan TWOC once constipation resolved."

    {
      question: "What is stercoral ulceration? Who is at risk and what is the mortality rate if perforation occurs?",
      markscheme: "Stercoral ulceration is pressure necrosis of the colonic mucosa caused by a hard impacted faecal mass pressing against the bowel wall, typically in the sigmoid colon or rectum. At-risk populations: elderly, bedbound, demented, institutionalised, psychiatric patients, chronic opioid users. If the ulcer erodes through the full thickness of the bowel wall, stercoral perforation occurs, which carries a mortality rate of approximately 30-50%. It is a surgical emergency requiring laparotomy."
