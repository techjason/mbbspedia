## Complications of Knee Pain — By Condition and By Treatment

Complications in knee pain arise from two broad sources: **(1) complications of the underlying condition** (what happens if the disease progresses or is inadequately treated) and **(2) complications of treatment** (what can go wrong with the interventions we offer). Both are high-yield for exams and essential for informed consent discussions with patients.

---

## A. Complications of Underlying Conditions

### 1. Osteoarthritis — Progressive Joint Destruction

OA is a chronic, irreversible, progressive disease. If left untreated or inadequately managed:

| Complication | Pathophysiological Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Progressive cartilage loss → bone-on-bone articulation** | Ongoing imbalance between cartilage synthesis and degradation → complete loss of articular cartilage → exposed subchondral bone → bone-on-bone contact → severe pain, crepitus, loss of function |
| **Fixed flexion deformity** | Chronic inflammation → posterior capsule fibrosis and shortening → the knee cannot be passively extended beyond a certain point. Why posterior capsule? Because the knee naturally rests in slight flexion when painful (antalgic posture), and prolonged immobilisation in this position → adaptive shortening |
| **Varus or valgus deformity** | Asymmetric cartilage loss → medial compartment loss (more common) → progressive varus angulation (bow-legged). This further concentrates load on the medial side → accelerates medial wear → self-perpetuating vicious cycle |
| **Quadriceps atrophy and weakness** | Pain → reflex quadriceps inhibition (arthrogenic muscle inhibition) → disuse atrophy → loss of dynamic knee stability → functional decline → falls in elderly |
| **Reduced mobility and systemic consequences** | Immobility from knee OA → cardiovascular deconditioning, obesity (worsening the OA), depression, social isolation, increased all-cause mortality in elderly. OA is not "just a joint problem" — it is a systemic health burden |
| **Secondary OA from other conditions** | Untreated meniscal tears, ACL deficiency, crystal arthropathy, and haemophilic arthropathy all lead to secondary OA as their end-stage complication |

---

### 2. Septic Arthritis — Rapid Joint Destruction

***Bacterial infection can destroy joint cartilage in a few days*** [9]. This is why septic arthritis is the most feared complication-generating condition:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Irreversible cartilage destruction** | Neutrophil-derived proteases (MMPs, elastase) + bacterial toxins directly degrade the cartilage matrix. Cartilage is avascular → once destroyed, it cannot regenerate → permanent loss of articular surface |
| **Osteomyelitis** | Contiguous spread of infection from the joint into the subchondral bone → chronic bone infection that is extremely difficult to eradicate (bone has limited blood supply in areas of necrosis → antibiotic penetration is poor) |
| **Secondary OA** | Even with successful eradication of infection, the damaged cartilage surface leads to accelerated degenerative change |
| **Sepsis and multiorgan failure** | Bacteraemia from the infected joint → systemic inflammatory response → septic shock → organ failure. Mortality of untreated septic arthritis is significant (up to 10–15% even with treatment in elderly/immunocompromised) |
| **Joint ankylosis** | Severe inflammation → intra-articular adhesions and fibrosis → loss of motion → functional ankylosis (fibrous union) |

---

### 3. Ligament Injuries — Instability and Secondary Damage

#### ACL Tear

***Complications of untreated ACL deficiency*** [3]:
- ***Early OA knee*** — Without the ACL, the tibia subluxes anteriorly during activity → abnormal loading patterns on the articular cartilage → accelerated wear. This occurs regardless of whether the ACL is reconstructed — even with reconstruction, the rate of OA is higher than in normal knees, but substantially less than if left untreated
- ***New cartilage/meniscus injury*** — The unstable knee is prone to further "giving way" episodes → each episode can cause additional meniscal tears or chondral damage. This is the main argument for reconstruction in active patients

***Complications of ACL reconstruction*** [3]:
- ***Graft failure*** — The reconstructed graft can stretch (laxity) or rupture (re-tear), especially with early return to sport or aggressive rehabilitation. Risk is ~5–10% at 10 years
- ***OA knee*** — Even a successfully reconstructed knee has higher rates of OA than the uninjured population. This is partly due to the initial injury (chondral bruising, meniscal damage) and partly due to altered biomechanics
- ***Arthrofibrosis*** — Excessive scar tissue formation within the joint → loss of ROM (especially terminal extension). Risk is highest if surgery is performed acutely before the haemarthrosis and inflammation settle — this is ***why timing is after haemarthrosis resolves and regaining ROM — require PT "prehab"*** [3]

#### MCL Tear

***Complications: knee instability, saphenous nerve injury*** [3].
- **Knee instability**: Grade III tears, if inadequately rehabilitated, may result in residual valgus laxity
- ***Saphenous nerve injury***: The saphenous nerve runs along the medial aspect of the knee, in close proximity to the MCL. Injury during trauma or surgery → numbness along the medial leg and foot. This nerve is purely sensory — no motor deficit

---

### 4. Meniscal Tears — Mechanical Complications and OA

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Locked knee*** | ***Bucket-handle tear*** — a large longitudinal tear where the central fragment displaces into the intercondylar notch → physically blocks knee extension. A true mechanical lock (not pseudo-locking from pain). Requires urgent arthroscopic reduction/meniscectomy [3] |
| **Persistent effusion** | Torn meniscal fragment irritates the synovium → chronic reactive synovitis → persistent effusion |
| **Secondary OA** | Loss of meniscal tissue (whether from the tear itself or from meniscectomy) → reduced load distribution → increased point stress on articular cartilage → accelerated degeneration. This is why meniscal preservation (repair over meniscectomy) is emphasised whenever possible |

---

### 5. Crystal Arthritis — Chronic Joint Destruction

#### Gout

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Chronic tophaceous gout** | Persistent hyperuricaemia → MSU crystal deposition in periarticular tissues, tendons, bursae, subcutaneous tissue → formation of **tophi** (organised granulomatous aggregates of MSU crystals surrounded by macrophages). Tophi can be disfiguring, ulcerate through skin, and destroy underlying bone |
| **Erosive arthropathy** | Tophi erode bone from the periarticular surface → characteristic "punched-out" erosions with overhanging edges on X-ray → progressive joint destruction → secondary OA |
| **Uric acid nephrolithiasis** | Hyperuricaemia → supersaturation of uric acid in urine (especially in acidic urine) → stone formation. Uric acid stones are radiolucent (cannot be seen on plain X-ray but visible on CT) |
| **Urate nephropathy** | Chronic: urate crystal deposition in renal medullary interstitium → chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis → CKD. Acute: massive urate load (e.g., tumour lysis syndrome) → uric acid crystal precipitation in renal tubules → acute oliguric renal failure |
| ***Gout → patellar bursitis*** [1] | MSU crystal deposition in the prepatellar bursa → crystal-induced bursitis mimicking or coexisting with septic bursitis |

#### Pseudogout (CPPD)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Chronic pyrophosphate arthropathy** | Chronic CPPD crystal deposition → progressive cartilage destruction resembling severe OA but with distinctive distribution (knee, wrist, MCP) → the so-called "pseudo-OA" pattern |
| **Crowned dens syndrome** | CPPD crystal deposition around the odontoid process → acute neck pain and stiffness mimicking meningitis or polymyalgia rheumatica |

---

### 6. Haemophilia — ***Haemophilic Arthropathy***

***Haemarthrosis (up to 80%)*** — ***most common site: major weight-bearing joints, e.g., ankles, knees, elbows*** [7].

***Late complications*** [7]:
- ***Haemophilic arthropathy: occurs in up to 50% in severe haemophilia***
  - ***Target joint: a prior bleed results in joint damage and inflammation → predisposes to further bleeding*** [7]
  - ***Pathology: multifactorial due to synovial hypertrophy, cartilage destruction, secondary OA*** [7]
  - ***Presentation: typically as joint pain, stiffness, contractures developing in adolescence*** [7]

> **Why does a "target joint" develop?** The first haemarthrosis causes iron deposition (haemosiderin) in the synovium → synovial hypertrophy and hypervascularity (making the synovium more friable and prone to bleeding) → subsequent bleeds occur more easily → a self-perpetuating cycle of bleeding and joint damage. Iron is directly toxic to chondrocytes and stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokines → cartilage destruction → secondary OA.

---

### 7. Baker's Cyst — ***Rupture***

***Ruptured popliteal (Baker's) cyst*** [1]:
- **Mechanism**: Increasing intra-articular pressure (from effusion in OA, RA, or meniscal tear) distends the cyst → the cyst wall eventually gives way → synovial fluid dissects inferiorly along the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle planes into the calf
- **Presentation**: Acute calf pain, swelling, and ecchymosis (crescent sign around the medial malleolus) → **mimics DVT** (pseudothrombophlebitis syndrome)
- **Why does it mimic DVT?** Both present with unilateral calf swelling, pain, and warmth. ***Ruptured Baker's cyst only occurs in pre-existing arthritis*** [7] — so always ask about a history of knee joint disease. Duplex USG differentiates the two
- **Complication of the rupture itself**: The inflammatory synovial fluid causes a chemical irritation of the calf tissues → may take 2–4 weeks to resolve. Compartment syndrome from a ruptured Baker's cyst is extremely rare but has been reported

---

### 8. Fractures Around the Knee

***Tibial shaft/plateau fractures — complications*** [3]:
- ***Compartment syndrome*** [3] — ***6 Ps: Pain (out of proportion, exacerbated by passive dorsiflexion of great toe — earliest and most sensitive), Pressure, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paraesthesia, Paralysis***

**Compartment syndrome explained from first principles** [22][23]:

***Mechanism***: ***Prolonged ischaemia when cell membrane is damaged and fluid leaks out into interstitial space in the muscle which are enclosed within a non-distensible fascial envelope*** [22]. Alternatively, ***post-ischaemic compartment syndrome occurs after revascularisation: ischaemic muscle → formation of oxygen free radicals → damage capillary walls → increased vascular permeability upon reperfusion → localised swelling and oedema → increased compartment pressure*** [22].

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Critical pressure** | ***Secondary ischaemia when pressure ≥ 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP*** [23] |
| **Most commonly affected** | ***Anterior compartment*** of the leg (contains tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, deep peroneal nerve) [22] |
| **Most devastating** | ***Posterior compartment*** involvement (contains the posterior tibial artery and tibial nerve — loss leads to foot ischaemia and sensory loss in the sole) [22] |
| **Earliest symptom** | ***Pain out of proportion to clinical situation*** [23] |
| **Most sensitive sign** | ***Pain with passive stretch*** (dorsiflexion of great toe stretches the deep posterior compartment / plantarflexion stretches the anterior compartment) [23] |
| **Management** | ***Emergent fasciotomy → lay open for oedema to resolve, then close after a few days. Consider prophylactic fasciotomy in OT if drastic ischaemia*** [23] |

If untreated → ***ischaemia, necrosis, fibrosis → subsequent contraction of Achilles tendon*** [7] (Volkmann's ischaemic contracture equivalent in the lower limb).

Other fracture complications:
- ***Limb ischaemia*** [3] — popliteal artery injury in knee dislocations or proximal tibial fractures
- ***Malunion/non-union*** [3]
- **DVT/PE** — fractures immobilise the limb → Virchow's triad (stasis + endothelial injury from fracture + hypercoagulability from trauma response) → venous thromboembolism
- **Infection** — especially in ***open fractures*** which are common in tibial fractures due to ***lack of significant soft tissue protection (especially anteromedial side)*** [3]
- **Post-traumatic OA** — articular fractures (tibial plateau) that are not anatomically reduced → step-off in the articular surface → point-loading → secondary OA

---

### 9. DVT Around the Knee

***DVT*** is listed as a ***serious disorder not to be missed*** [1] because:
- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: Thrombus propagates proximally or embolises to the pulmonary vasculature → acute right heart strain → hemodynamic collapse → death if massive. PE occurs in approximately 50% of untreated proximal DVTs
- **Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)**: Chronic venous hypertension from valvular damage → leg swelling, pain, skin changes (lipodermatosclerosis, venous ulcers). Occurs in 20–50% of DVT patients despite anticoagulation

---

### 10. Malignancy

***Primary bone tumours (e.g., osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma)*** [1] and metastases carry their own set of complications:
- **Pathological fracture**: Tumour replaces normal bone → structural weakness → fracture through abnormal bone with minimal trauma
- **Metastasis**: Primary bone tumours (especially osteosarcoma) metastasise haematogenously to the lungs
- **Complications of treatment**: Limb salvage surgery (risk of prosthesis failure, infection, limb-length discrepancy) vs. amputation (phantom limb pain, prosthetic challenges, psychological impact)

---

## B. Complications of Treatment

### 1. Total Knee Replacement (TKR)

***Specific complications of total replacement*** [3]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Immediate*** | ***Bone fracture*** | Intra-operative fracture during bone cuts or component impaction, especially in osteoporotic bone |
| ***Immediate*** | ***Vascular injury (popliteal artery in TKR)*** [3] | The popliteal artery lies posterior to the knee — at risk during posterior capsule release or during cementation when the knee is hyperflexed |
| ***Immediate*** | ***Nerve injury (CPN in TKR)*** [3] | The common peroneal nerve wraps around the fibular neck and can be stretched during correction of a fixed valgus or flexion deformity → foot drop. Incidence ~0.3–1.3% |
| ***Early*** | ***DVT/PE*** [3] | Virchow's triad: tourniquet use → stasis; surgical trauma → endothelial injury; post-operative immobility → stasis. All TKR patients receive thromboprophylaxis (LMWH, DOACs, or aspirin) |
| ***Early*** | ***Infection (difficult to detect and treat)*** [3] | Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) — bacteria form biofilms on the prosthetic surface → resistant to antibiotics and immune clearance. Early infection ( < 3 months): usually from intra-operative contamination (S. aureus, S. epidermidis). Presents with wound erythema, persistent drainage, fever |
| ***Late*** | ***Prosthesis infection*** [3] | Late haematogenous seeding (from dental procedures, UTI, skin infections) → biofilm formation → chronic PJI. May need two-stage revision (remove prosthesis → antibiotic spacer → 6 weeks IV antibiotics → re-implant) |
| ***Late*** | ***Patellar instability*** [3] | Malrotation of the components (internal rotation of tibial or femoral components) → patellar maltracking → subluxation or dislocation |
| ***Late*** | ***Aseptic loosening*** | ***Limited lifespan (usually > 15 years) due to aseptic loosening (due to periarticular foreign body reaction resulting in osteolysis and loosening)*** [21]. Polyethylene wear particles → macrophage phagocytosis → release of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 → osteoclast activation → periprosthetic bone resorption → component loosening → pain and instability → requires revision surgery |
| ***Late*** | ***Periprosthetic fracture*** | Bone around the prosthesis is stressed at the tip of the implant (stress riser) + osteoporotic bone → fracture adjacent to the prosthesis. Difficult to fix surgically |

> **Why does aseptic loosening happen?** Every step generates microscopic polyethylene (plastic) wear debris from the bearing surface. These particles are small enough (0.1–10 μm) to be phagocytosed by macrophages but too inert to be digested → frustrated phagocytosis → chronic inflammatory response → cytokine release → osteoclast recruitment → bone resorption around the implant → the implant becomes loose in its bony bed.

***Post-op care*** [3]:
- ***Early mobilisation (1 day after operation)***
- ***Avoid contact sports, extreme ROM of hip (angle of bed < 45°)***
- ***Survival of replacement (not requiring revision surgery): 15–20 years***

---

### 2. Knee Arthroscopy

***Complications of knee arthroscopy: damage to saphenous nerve and vein, peroneal nerve, popliteal vessels*** [3].

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Saphenous nerve/vein injury** | Medial portal placement → the saphenous nerve and its infrapatellar branch run medially → direct injury during portal insertion. Results in medial knee/leg numbness |
| **Common peroneal nerve injury** | Lateral portal placement or manipulation near the fibular neck → nerve stretch or direct injury → foot drop |
| **Popliteal vessel injury** | Posterior meniscal work → instruments can penetrate posteriorly → popliteal artery/vein injury. Extremely rare but catastrophic |
| **Infection** | Post-arthroscopic septic arthritis (~0.1–0.4%) — lower risk than open surgery but still possible |
| **Haemarthrosis** | Damage to intra-articular vasculature → blood accumulation → pain and swelling |
| **Arthrofibrosis** | Excessive scar tissue formation post-operatively → stiffness and loss of ROM |
| **DVT/PE** | Lower risk than TKR but still possible, especially with tourniquet use |

---

### 3. ACL Reconstruction

***Complications*** [3]:
- ***Graft failure*** — Re-rupture rate ~5–10% at 10 years. Higher with early return to sport, hamstring grafts in young athletes, allograft use
- ***OA knee*** — Despite reconstruction, the joint has already sustained cartilage and meniscal damage from the initial injury. Altered biomechanics persist even with a functioning graft
- ***Arthrofibrosis*** — Most common cause of poor outcome. Prevention: adequate prehabilitation, delayed surgery until full ROM regained, aggressive early post-operative ROM exercises
- **Donor site morbidity** (graft-specific):
  - ***Patellar tendon graft: anterior knee pain*** [3] (kneeling pain) + risk of patellar fracture or tendon rupture
  - ***Hamstring graft: poor initial healing*** [3] + hamstring weakness (may affect sprinting)
  - ***Quadriceps tendon: avoid injury to infrapatellar branch of saphenous nerve*** [3]
  - ***Allograft: risk of infection and immunologic reaction*** [3]

---

### 4. Complications of Medications

| Drug Class | Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **NSAIDs** | GI ulceration/bleeding, AKI, cardiovascular events, hypertension, fluid retention | COX-1 inhibition → ↓protective prostaglandins in gastric mucosa → erosion + ulceration. Renal prostaglandin inhibition → ↓afferent arteriolar dilatation → ↓GFR. COX-2 inhibition → prothrombotic imbalance (↓prostacyclin, ↑thromboxane) |
| **Colchicine** | Diarrhoea (dose-dependent), bone marrow suppression (overdose), fatal toxicity with CYP3A4 inhibitors | Binds tubulin → inhibits mitotic spindle → affects rapidly dividing cells (GI mucosa, bone marrow). No antidote for overdose |
| **Corticosteroids (systemic, prolonged)** | Osteoporosis, AVN, hyperglycaemia, infection, Cushing's, adrenal suppression, myopathy | Steroids stimulate osteoclasts + inhibit osteoblasts → bone loss. AVN: mechanism uncertain but may involve fat embolism to subchondral vessels or direct lipocyte hypertrophy → increased intraosseous pressure |
| **Corticosteroids (intra-articular, repeated)** | Accelerated cartilage loss, post-injection flare, septic arthritis (if contaminated), soft tissue atrophy | Steroids are catabolic to cartilage matrix at high local concentrations → chondrocyte apoptosis. Recommended limit: 3–4 injections per joint per year |
| **Allopurinol** | Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (DRESS/SJS/TEN) — associated with **HLA-B*5801** (prevalent ~6–8% in HK Chinese) | Immune-mediated type IV hypersensitivity → widespread skin and organ involvement. Mortality 20–25% for SJS/TEN. **Must screen HLA-B*5801 before starting** |
| **Methotrexate (for RA)** | Hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression, interstitial pneumonitis, teratogenicity | Folate antagonist → impairs DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells. Supplement with folic acid to reduce side effects |
| **Biologic DMARDs (anti-TNF)** | Serious infections (TB reactivation, opportunistic infections), demyelinating disease, heart failure exacerbation | TNF-α is critical for granuloma maintenance (containing TB) and defence against intracellular pathogens → inhibition → reactivation of latent infections. Screen for latent TB before starting |

---

### 5. Osteotomy Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Under- or over-correction** | Inaccurate pre-operative planning or intra-operative execution → residual malalignment or over-correction into opposite deformity |
| **Non-union / delayed union** | Inadequate fixation, poor blood supply, smoking → failure of osteotomy site to heal |
| **Neurovascular injury** | Peroneal nerve at risk in lateral closing-wedge high tibial osteotomy; popliteal vessels at risk posteriorly |
| **Compartment syndrome** | Oedema from surgical trauma in a tightly fascial-bound compartment |
| **Stiffness** | Post-operative immobilisation → adhesions and capsular contracture |

---

## C. Complications of Immobility from Knee Pain

Regardless of the cause, severe knee pain leading to immobility has its own cascade of complications — particularly in the elderly:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE)** | Immobility → venous stasis (Virchow's triad) |
| **Muscle atrophy** | Disuse → rapid quadriceps wasting (measurable within 1 week of immobilisation) |
| **Joint contracture** | Prolonged flexed position → adaptive shortening of hamstrings and posterior capsule → fixed flexion deformity |
| **Pressure sores** | Immobility + poor nutrition → skin breakdown over bony prominences |
| **Depression and social isolation** | Pain → inability to participate in activities → psychological deterioration. ***Depression*** is listed as a ***masquerade*** for knee pain [1] — it can both cause and result from chronic knee pain |
| **Falls and fractures** | Quadriceps weakness + impaired proprioception → balance impairment → falls → hip fractures (especially in osteoporotic elderly) |
| **Cardiovascular deconditioning** | Reduced physical activity → worsened cardiovascular fitness → increased all-cause mortality |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary - Complications">

1. **Septic arthritis** can destroy cartilage within days → irreversible joint damage, osteomyelitis, sepsis, ankylosis. This is why it is treated as an emergency.

2. **TKR complications by timing**: Immediate (fracture, popliteal artery injury, CPN palsy) → Early (DVT/PE, infection) → Late (aseptic loosening, prosthesis infection, periprosthetic fracture, patellar instability). Prosthesis survives 15–20 years; aseptic loosening from polyethylene wear particle-induced osteolysis is the main long-term failure mode.

3. **Compartment syndrome**: Pain out of proportion (earliest symptom), pain with passive stretch (most sensitive sign). Pressure ≥ 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP. Treatment: emergent fasciotomy. Anterior compartment most commonly affected; posterior compartment most devastating.

4. **ACL deficiency → secondary meniscal and chondral damage → early OA**. ACL reconstruction complications include graft failure, arthrofibrosis, and donor site morbidity.

5. **Haemophilic arthropathy**: Target joint concept — prior bleed → synovial hypertrophy → predisposes to further bleeding → progressive cartilage destruction → secondary OA.

6. **Baker's cyst rupture** mimics DVT — always differentiate with duplex USG.

7. **Allopurinol hypersensitivity** (DRESS/SJS/TEN) — screen HLA-B*5801 before prescribing in HK Chinese patients.

8. **Immobility from knee pain** itself causes DVT, contracture, atrophy, falls, depression, and cardiovascular deconditioning — a major driver of morbidity in the elderly.
