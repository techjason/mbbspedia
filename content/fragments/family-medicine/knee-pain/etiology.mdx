# Knee Pain

## Definition

**Knee pain** is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints encountered in both primary care and emergency settings. It refers to any pain localised to or around the knee joint — anteriorly, medially, laterally, posteriorly, or diffusely — arising from pathology of intra-articular structures (cartilage, menisci, ligaments, synovium, bone) or peri-articular structures (tendons, bursae, muscles, nerves).

The knee is the largest synovial joint in the body and arguably the most frequently injured, owing to its position between two long lever arms (femur and tibia) and its reliance on soft-tissue stabilisers rather than bony congruence for stability.

> **Why is the knee so vulnerable?** Unlike the hip (a deep ball-and-socket with inherent bony stability), the knee is essentially two convex condyles sitting on a flat tibial plateau. Stability depends almost entirely on ligaments, menisci, and muscles — so when any of these fail, pain and dysfunction follow quickly.

---

## Epidemiology

- **Prevalence**: Knee pain affects approximately 25% of adults at any given time, making it the second most common musculoskeletal complaint after low back pain [1][2].
- **Age distribution**:
  - Young adults (15–35): trauma-related (ACL tears, meniscal injuries, patellofemoral syndrome, fractures), overuse injuries (runner's knee, IT band syndrome, Osgood–Schlatter in adolescents)
  - Middle-aged (35–55): degenerative meniscal tears, early osteoarthritis, crystal arthropathies (gout, pseudogout)
  - Elderly ( > 55): ***osteoarthritis*** (by far the commonest cause), crystal arthropathies, insufficiency fractures, ***referred pain from the hip or spine*** [1]
- **Sex**: OA knee is more common in ***females*** [3]; ligamentous injuries (particularly ACL) are 2–8× more common in females in sports settings; gout is more common in males (M:F ≈ 5:1) [5]
- **Hong Kong context**: With an ageing population and high prevalence of obesity, OA knee is a major burden. Gout prevalence in HK is rising (estimated ~3% in men). Septic arthritis, while uncommon, must always be excluded in the acutely swollen hot knee.

## Risk Factors

| Category | Specific Risk Factors |
|---|---|
| **Demographics** | ***Increasing age***, ***female sex*** (for OA), male sex (for gout, ligament injury in certain sports) |
| **Constitutional** | ***Obesity*** (every 1 kg of body weight = ~4 kg load across the knee during walking), ***low bone density*** |
| **Biomechanical** | Malalignment (genu varum/valgum), leg length discrepancy, flat feet (pes planus), muscle weakness (esp. quadriceps) |
| **Previous injury** | ***Previous trauma*** (meniscal tear, ligament injury, fracture → secondary OA), recurrent dislocations |
| **Occupational/Activity** | Repetitive kneeling (prepatellar bursitis — "housemaid's knee"), running/cycling (ITBS, patellofemoral syndrome), heavy manual labour |
| **Genetic** | Family history of OA, chondrocalcinosis (familial CPPD — ***AD inheritance, CCAL1/2 mutation***) [6] |
| **Metabolic** | Hyperuricaemia (gout), haemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, Wilson's disease (secondary CPPD) [6] |
| **Joint disease** | Pre-existing RA, crystal arthropathy, haemophilia (haemarthrosis → haemophilic arthropathy) [7] |
| **Systemic** | Diabetes mellitus (Charcot arthropathy, increased infection risk), immunosuppression, chronic kidney disease |

## Anatomy and Function

Understanding knee anatomy is essential because the history and examination findings point you directly to the damaged structure.

### Bony Anatomy
- **Femur**: Two large condyles (medial and lateral) articulate with the tibial plateau. The medial condyle extends more distally — this is why the normal alignment of the knee has a slight valgus angle (~5–7°).
- **Tibia**: The tibial plateau has medial and lateral compartments separated by the intercondylar eminence (tibial spine). The medial plateau is concave (more congruent); the lateral plateau is convex (less inherently stable — relies more on meniscus).
- **Patella**: The largest sesamoid bone in the body, embedded within the quadriceps tendon. It articulates with the trochlear groove of the femur to form the **patellofemoral joint**. Function: increases the mechanical advantage of the quadriceps by up to 50% by increasing the lever arm.
- **Fibula**: The proximal fibula does NOT articulate with the knee joint proper but serves as the attachment for the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and biceps femoris.
- **Three compartments**: ***medial, lateral, patellofemoral*** — each can be independently affected by OA [3].

### Menisci
- Two C-shaped fibrocartilaginous structures sitting on the tibial plateau.
- **Medial meniscus**: Larger, C-shaped, firmly attached to the deep layer of the MCL → less mobile → more prone to injury (medial:lateral tear ratio ≈ 2:1).
- **Lateral meniscus**: Smaller, more circular, not attached to the LCL → more mobile → less commonly torn.
- **Function**: Load distribution (absorb ~50% of load in extension, ~85% in flexion), shock absorption, joint stability, lubrication, proprioception.
- **Blood supply**: The outer 1/3 ("red zone") has blood supply from the perimeniscal capillary plexus → can heal → amenable to **meniscal repair with suture**. The inner 2/3 ("white zone") is avascular → cannot heal → requires **partial meniscectomy** if torn [3].

### Ligaments
- **Cruciate ligaments** (intra-articular but extra-synovial):
  - **ACL** (anterior cruciate ligament): Prevents anterior translation of tibia on femur and resists internal rotation. Origin: posterior intercondylar area of lateral femoral condyle. Insertion: anterior intercondylar area of tibia.
  - **PCL** (posterior cruciate ligament): Prevents posterior translation of tibia on femur. Strongest knee ligament. Origin: medial femoral condyle. Insertion: posterior intercondylar area.
- **Collateral ligaments** (extra-articular):
  - **MCL** (medial collateral ligament): Resists valgus stress. Has deep and superficial layers; deep layer attached to medial meniscus (hence combined MCL + medial meniscal injuries).
  - **LCL** (lateral collateral ligament): Resists varus stress. Runs from lateral femoral epicondyle to fibular head. NOT attached to lateral meniscus.
- **Other stabilisers**: Posterolateral corner (LCL + popliteus + arcuate ligament), posteromedial corner, iliotibial band, popliteofibular ligament.

> **The "Unhappy Triad" (O'Donoghue's triad)**: ACL + MCL + medial meniscus injury — classically from a valgus force with external rotation (e.g., football tackle). Modern evidence suggests the lateral meniscus is actually more commonly injured with acute ACL tears, but the classic triad remains a favourite exam topic.

### Bursae
- **Prepatellar bursa**: Anterior to patella → "housemaid's knee" (prepatellar bursitis from kneeling).
- **Infrapatellar bursa**: Deep (between patellar tendon and tibia) and superficial (between patellar tendon and skin) → "clergyman's knee."
- **Pes anserine bursa**: Medial, inferior to joint line, at insertion of sartorius, gracilis, semitendinosus (mnemonic: **S**ay **G**race before **T**ea, or **SGT** — Sartorius, Gracilis, semi-Tendinosus). Pes anserine bursitis causes medial knee pain below the joint line.
- **Suprapatellar bursa**: Communicates with the joint space → effusions collect here first (test with the "patellar tap" or "bulge test").
- ***Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst)***: Not a true bursa but a distension of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa. ***Usually arises in association with underlying joint disease*** (OA, RA, meniscal tear). ***Presents with posterior knee pain and stiffness and a mass or swelling behind the knee*** [2]. Can rupture and mimic DVT (pseudothrombophlebitis).

### Muscles
- **Quadriceps** (anterior): Rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus medialis. Primary knee extensor. Vastus medialis oblique (VMO) is critical for patellar tracking.
- **Hamstrings** (posterior): Biceps femoris (lateral), semimembranosus, semitendinosus (medial). Primary knee flexors.
- **Popliteus**: "Unlocks" the knee from full extension by internally rotating the tibia.
- **Gastrocnemius**: Crosses the knee posteriorly; relevant in Baker's cyst anatomy.
- ***Iliotibial band (IT band)***: ***Shared aponeurosis of tensor fasciae latae and gluteus maximus***. ***Extends from iliac tubercle to anterolateral tubercle of tibia (Gerdy's tubercle)***. Overuse → ***inflammation and impingement against lateral femoral condyle*** → IT band syndrome [3].

### Neurovascular
- **Popliteal artery**: Lies posterior and deep in the popliteal fossa — vulnerable in posterior knee dislocations and proximal tibial fractures. **Always check distal pulses** after knee trauma.
- **Common peroneal nerve**: Wraps around the fibular neck — vulnerable to injury from fibular fractures, tight casts, or lateral knee surgery → foot drop.
- **Saphenous nerve**: Medial aspect — can be damaged during medial knee arthroscopy.
- ***Complications of knee arthroscopy: damage to saphenous nerve and vein, peroneal nerve, popliteal vessels*** [3].

### Alignment
- **Normal tibiofemoral angle (TFA)**: ~5–7° valgus.
- **Mechanical axis**: A line from centre of femoral head to centre of ankle. Normally passes through or just medial to the centre of the knee.
  - If the axis falls **medial** to the knee centre → **varus** malalignment (bow-legged) → overloads the **medial** compartment → medial OA.
  - If the axis falls **lateral** to the knee centre → **valgus** malalignment (knock-kneed) → overloads the **lateral** compartment → lateral OA.
- ***Standing scanogram of bilateral LL*** is used to assess alignment [3].

## Etiology (Hong Kong Focus) and Pathophysiology

The causes of knee pain are best approached by **age** and **mechanism** (traumatic vs. atraumatic, acute vs. chronic). The ***masquerades checklist*** reminds us to consider ***depression, diabetes, and spinal dysfunction (referred pain)*** as non-obvious causes [1].

### A. Degenerative / Wear-and-Tear

#### 1. Osteoarthritis (OA) — ***The Commonest Cause of Knee Pain in HK***

***Definition: Chronic wear and tear process involving a joint; degeneration is only one of the causes*** [3].

**Aetiology** [3]:
- ***Primary (degenerative)***: ***More common in elderly > 70y as OA knee***
- ***Secondary***: ***May be seen in young < 50y — must ask about previous trauma and chronic joint instability***
  - ***Defective load***:
    - Force: ***obesity, occupational overuse***
    - Area: ***joint dysplasia***
  - ***Defective cartilage***:
    - Damage: ***trauma, haemophilia***
    - Diseases: ***inflammatory (e.g., RA), metabolic (e.g., gout), infection***
    - Unsupported: ***AVN***

**Pathophysiology** (understanding this explains ALL the symptoms and signs):
1. **Cartilage degradation**: Chondrocytes fail to maintain the balance between synthesis and degradation of the extracellular matrix. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and aggrecanases break down type II collagen and proteoglycans → loss of cartilage resilience and shock absorption.
2. **Subchondral bone changes**: Loss of cartilage → increased stress on subchondral bone → reactive sclerosis (thickening). Microfractures in sclerotic bone allow synovial fluid intrusion → **subchondral cysts**. Bone at joint margins proliferates → **osteophytes** (the body's attempt to redistribute load over a wider area).
3. **Synovial inflammation**: Cartilage breakdown products enter synovial fluid → activate innate immune response → low-grade synovitis → effusion, warmth.
4. **Joint capsule changes**: Chronic inflammation → capsular thickening and fibrosis → reduced range of motion.
5. **Muscle weakness**: Pain → disuse → quadriceps atrophy → further loss of dynamic stability → accelerated degeneration.

> **Why does OA prefer weight-bearing joints?** Because axial loading accelerates cartilage wear. The knee bears ~3–6× body weight during stair climbing, which is why ***knee pain is worse on going downstairs (patellofemoral joint involvement)*** [3].

***Radiological features (LOSS)*** [3]:
- ***Loss of joint space*** (earliest radiographic sign)
- ***Osteophytes***
- ***Subchondral cysts***
- ***Subchondral sclerosis***

***Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) Classification*** [3]:

| Grade | Description |
|---|---|
| ***Grade 0*** | ***No joint space narrowing (JSN)*** |
| ***Grade 1*** | ***Possible osteophytes, doubtful JSN*** |
| ***Grade 2*** | ***Definite osteophytes*** |
| ***Grade 3*** | ***Definite JSN*** |
| ***Grade 4*** | ***Bone-on-bone deformity*** |

***Radiographic views for OA knee*** [3]:
- ***Weightbearing AP***: ***medial vs lateral compartment***
- ***Lateral***: ***anteromedial vs posteromedial (e.g., posterior osteophytes)***
- ***Skyline***: ***patellofemoral joint space***
- ***Valgus stress / Varus stress***: ***assess medial / lateral joint space***
- ***Standing scanogram***: ***alignment***
- ***+/- Schuss view (30° flexion)***: ***more sensitive for early OA***

***Classification of OA progression: WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index)*** [3].

#### 2. Meniscal Degeneration
- In middle-aged and elderly patients, meniscal tears are often **degenerative** (not traumatic). The meniscal tissue loses water content and becomes brittle → horizontal cleavage tears from normal activities.
- May co-exist with OA and contribute to mechanical symptoms.

---

### B. Traumatic / Mechanical

#### 1. Meniscal Tears

**Mechanism**: Rotational force on a flexed, weight-bearing knee (e.g., twisting while the foot is planted).

***Tear patterns*** [3]:
- ***Vertical/Longitudinal tear → may progress to Bucket Handle Tear*** (a large longitudinal tear that displaces centrally like a bucket handle → causes **locked knee** because the displaced fragment blocks extension)
- ***Radial Tear → may progress to Parrot Beak Tear***
- ***Horizontal Tear → may progress to Flap Tear***

**Pathophysiology**: Torn meniscal fragment catches between femoral condyle and tibial plateau during movement → mechanical symptoms (locking, catching, giving way).

**Blood supply and healing** (critical for management decisions):
- Outer 1/3 (red-red zone): Good blood supply → can heal → **meniscal repair with suture**
- Middle 1/3 (red-white zone): Intermediate → either repair or meniscectomy
- Inner 2/3 (white-white zone): Avascular → cannot heal → **partial meniscectomy** [3]

***Management*** [3]:
- ***Conservative: preferred for < 1 cm meniscal tear*** — ***RICE, analgesics, rehabilitation (encourage ROM, muscle strengthening)***
- ***Operative: arthroscopic surgery***
  - ***Indications: failed conservative treatment, bucket-handle tear, associated ligament injury, locked knee***
  - ***Meniscal repair with suture: outer 1/3, vertical tear***
  - ***Partial meniscectomy: inner 1/3 (e.g., radial tear, horizontal tear)***
  - ***Either one if middle 1/3***

#### 2. Ligament Injuries

**ACL Tear**:
- Mechanism: Non-contact pivoting injury, sudden deceleration, hyperextension, valgus + external rotation.
- Pathophysiology: ACL is the primary restraint against anterior tibial translation. Torn ACL → anterior instability → giving way during pivoting activities. The ACL has poor blood supply (intra-articular environment bathed in synovial fluid washes away the haematoma needed for healing) → rarely heals spontaneously.
- Acute presentation: Audible "pop," immediate swelling (haemarthrosis within 2 hours — because the ACL is vascular enough to bleed but not enough to heal), inability to continue activity.
- Examination: Lachman test (most sensitive), anterior drawer test, pivot shift test.

**PCL Tear**:
- Mechanism: Dashboard injury (direct blow to proximal tibia with knee flexed), fall on flexed knee.
- Pathophysiology: PCL prevents posterior tibial translation. Less functionally disabling than ACL tear in most patients because the PCL is stronger and secondary restraints compensate.
- Examination: Posterior drawer test, posterior sag sign.

**MCL Injury**:
- Mechanism: Valgus force (blow to lateral knee).
- Pathophysiology: MCL resists valgus opening. Usually heals well non-operatively because it has good blood supply (extra-articular).
- Examination: Valgus stress test at 0° and 30° flexion.

**LCL Injury**:
- Mechanism: Varus force (blow to medial knee). Less common than MCL.
- Always check for associated posterolateral corner injury and common peroneal nerve injury (foot drop).

#### 3. Patellar and Extensor Mechanism Injuries

***Patella fracture*** [3]:
- Mechanism: Direct blow (dashboard injury, fall on knee) or indirect (forceful quadriceps contraction).
- Pathophysiology: Disrupts the extensor mechanism → inability to actively extend the knee (extension lag).

**Patellar dislocation**:
- Mechanism: Usually lateral dislocation from a twisting injury with valgus force. More common in young females, those with patella alta, trochlear dysplasia, increased Q-angle.
- Pathophysiology: Vastus medialis oblique (VMO) is the primary dynamic medial stabiliser of the patella; if weak or if lateral forces dominate, the patella subluxes laterally.
- Examination: Positive apprehension test (patient becomes anxious when you push patella laterally with knee near extension).

#### 4. Fractures Around the Knee
- Distal femoral fractures, tibial plateau fractures, proximal fibular fractures.
- ***Tibial plateau fractures***: High-energy (young adults — think road traffic accident) or low-energy (elderly with osteoporosis — think fall from standing). Valgus force → lateral tibial plateau fracture (more common). Varus force → medial plateau fracture (less common but more severe). Always assess for neurovascular injury and compartment syndrome.

---

### C. Inflammatory / Crystal Arthropathies

#### 1. Gout

"Gout" from Latin *gutta* = "drop" (medieval belief that disease was caused by a drop of bad humour into the joint).

- ***Epidemiology***: ***Prevalence ~1–2%, ↑ in developed countries. M >> F ≈ 5:1*** [5].
- ***Pathophysiology***: Supersaturation of monosodium urate (MSU) in synovial fluid → crystal precipitation → phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages → NLRP3 inflammasome activation → IL-1β release → intense acute inflammatory response.
- **Knee involvement**: The knee is the 2nd most common joint affected by acute gout (after the 1st MTP — podagra). ***Gout → patellar bursitis*** [1].
- **Why monoarticular?** Crystal deposition depends on local factors (temperature, pH, mechanical stress). Peripheral joints are cooler → lower urate solubility → more crystal formation.

#### 2. Pseudogout (CPPD Crystal Deposition Disease)

"Pseudo" = false + "gout" → clinically mimics gout but caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals.

- ***Epidemiology***: ***Prevalence 4–7% (10–15% in 65–75y, 30–60% in > 85y)***. ***↑ with age (rare < 55y)*** [6].
- ***Pathophysiology***: ***Excessive pyrophosphate production: ↑ATP breakdown by chondrocytes → pyrophosphate formation (PPi). PPi normally converted by ALP to inorganic phosphate → under influence of growth-promoting factors, PPi complexes with calcium to form crystals*** [6].
- ***Chondrocalcinosis***: ***Radiological calcification in hyaline cartilage and/or fibrocartilage***. ***Commonly present in CPPD disease but not always. Not specific for CPPD disease as it is commonly present among normal population especially OA*** [6].
- ***Secondary causes***: ***Haemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism (3.35×), Wilson's disease, hypomagnesaemia, hypophosphatasia*** [6]. → Always screen for metabolic causes in a young patient with chondrocalcinosis!
- The knee is the **most commonly affected joint** in pseudogout.

> ***Pseudogout (chondrocalcinosis)*** is specifically listed as a cause of knee pain [1].

#### 3. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

- ***Epidemiology***: ***0.3–0.4% in Chinese*** (lower than Caucasians). ***Peak age 35–55y, F > M = 3:1*** [8].
- The knee is commonly affected in established RA, usually as part of a symmetrical polyarthritis affecting small joints first.
- Pathophysiology: Autoimmune synovitis → pannus formation → cartilage and bone erosion → joint destruction.

#### 4. Spondyloarthropathies
- ***Spondyloarthropathy*** is listed as a rare cause of knee pain [1].
- Includes ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, IBD-associated arthritis.
- Characteristically asymmetric, oligoarticular, lower limb predominant. Enthesitis (inflammation at tendon/ligament insertion) is a hallmark.

---

### D. Infectious

#### Septic Arthritis — ***A Rheumatological Emergency***

- ***Bacterial infection can destroy joint cartilage in a few days*** [9].
- ***Most common organism in adults: S. aureus*** [9].
- ***Risk factors***: ***Extremes of age, chronic arthritis (RA, crystal arthritis, severe OA), prosthetic joints, intra-articular injection, IVDU, DM, immunocompromised*** [9].
- ***Knee is the most commonly affected joint ( > 90%)*** [9].
- ***Clinical features: High fever, monoarthritis (80–90%) with joint pain, swelling, warmth, restricted ROM, effusion*** [9].
- ***Hot, swollen tender joint = septic arthritis until proven otherwise, even without fever, ↑WBC, ↑ESR/CRP*** [9].
- **Pathophysiology**: Bacteria reach the joint via haematogenous spread (most common), direct inoculation (trauma, surgery), or contiguous spread from adjacent osteomyelitis. Bacteria trigger intense neutrophilic inflammation → proteolytic enzymes destroy cartilage matrix → if untreated, permanent joint destruction within days.

---

### E. Periarticular / Soft Tissue

#### 1. ***Iliotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS)***

- ***Most common cause of lateral knee pain*** [3].
- ***Risk factors: Repetitive flexion and extension of knee (runners, weightlifters, cyclists), genu varum, hip abductor weakness*** [3].
- ***Pathophysiology: Inflammation → impingement against lateral femoral condyle*** [3].
- ***Special tests demonstrate pain over lateral femoral condyle at 30° flexion: Noble's test, Renne test*** [3].
- ***Management: Conservative (lifestyle modifications, analgesics, local steroid injections, physiotherapy). Operative if failed conservative treatment for 6 months (percutaneous/open release of iliotibial band)*** [3].

#### 2. Prepatellar Bursitis ("Housemaid's Knee")
- Cause: Repeated kneeling → friction and inflammation of the prepatellar bursa.
- Pathophysiology: Chronic microtrauma → bursal wall thickening and fluid accumulation. If infected (often through a break in skin over the knee), becomes **septic bursitis** (most commonly S. aureus).
- Presentation: Swelling anterior to the patella (distinct from joint effusion — a bursal swelling does not communicate with the joint and the patella tap is negative). Warm, tender if inflamed/infected.

#### 3. Pes Anserine Bursitis
- Medial knee pain below the joint line. Common in obese women with OA knee.
- Pathophysiology: Friction between the pes anserine tendons and the tibial insertion site → bursitis.

#### 4. Patellar Tendinopathy ("Jumper's Knee")
- Overuse injury of the patellar tendon at its origin from the inferior pole of the patella.
- Common in jumping athletes (basketball, volleyball).
- Pathophysiology: Repetitive tensile loading → collagen microtears → failed healing response with neovascularisation and mucoid degeneration (not true inflammation — hence "tendinopathy" not "tendinitis").

#### 5. ***Baker's Cyst (Popliteal Cyst)***
- ***Popliteal synovial cysts that usually arise in association with underlying joint disease*** [2].
- ***Cyst forms as an enlargement of gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa*** [2].
- ***Presents with posterior knee pain and stiffness and a mass or swelling behind the knee*** [2].
- **Pathophysiology**: Knee effusion (from OA, RA, meniscal tear) → increased intra-articular pressure → synovial fluid forced through a one-way valve mechanism into the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa → cyst formation. The valve mechanism means fluid enters but cannot return easily → progressive distension.
- **Complication**: ***Ruptured popliteal (Baker's) cyst*** → fluid tracks down the calf → acute calf pain, swelling, and ecchymosis → mimics DVT (pseudothrombophlebitis syndrome) [1].

---

### F. Referred Pain and Masquerades

<Callout title="Don't Forget the Hip!" type="error">
Hip pathology commonly presents as knee pain via the obturator nerve (L2-L4), which supplies both the hip joint and the medial aspect of the knee. In children, always examine the hip when a child presents with knee pain — you may miss a slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or Perthes disease!
</Callout>

- ***Spinal dysfunction (referred pain)***: Lumbar radiculopathy (L3/L4 → anterior knee; L5/S1 → lateral/posterior knee) [1].
- ***Sciatica***: ***Non-specific term that describes variety of leg and back symptoms. Radiculopathy (nerve root compression) at L5–S1 from a herniated (prolapsed) disc. Pain, numbness, tingling in the distribution of sciatic nerve. Sharp or burning pain that radiates down the posterior or lateral aspect of leg usually to foot or ankle*** [2].
- ***Depression***: Can present as chronic pain including knee pain [1].
- ***Diabetes***: Diabetic neuropathy → altered pain perception; Charcot arthropathy; increased infection risk [1].

---

### G. Paediatric Causes (Age-Related)

***Key principle: In children, always think age-related causes*** [4]:

| Age | Common Causes |
|---|---|
| **0–5 years** | Septic arthritis, transient synovitis ("irritable hip" — but child localises to knee), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), trauma (NAI?) |
| **5–10 years** | ***Perthes disease*** (***idiopathic AVN of proximal femoral epiphysis, boys aged 5–10y***) [4], transient synovitis |
| **10–16 years** | ***SCFE*** (***obese boys aged 10–15y***) [4], ***Osgood–Schlatter disorder*** [1], osteochondritis dissecans, patellofemoral syndrome |
| Adolescents | Avulsion fractures, stress fractures, bone tumours (***osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma***) [4] |

***Osgood–Schlatter disorder*** [1]:
- Traction apophysitis of the tibial tuberosity. Common in active adolescents (especially boys) during growth spurts.
- Pathophysiology: Repetitive traction on the immature tibial tuberosity by the patellar tendon → micro-avulsion → inflammation and new bone formation → painful bony prominence at the tibial tuberosity.
- Self-limiting — resolves when the growth plate closes.

---

### H. Vascular

#### 1. ***Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis / AVN)*** [1]
- Disruption of blood supply to subchondral bone → bone infarction → collapse.
- Sites in the knee: Medial femoral condyle most common (Spontaneous Osteonecrosis of the Knee — SONK, now more accurately called subchondral insufficiency fracture of the knee).
- Risk factors: Corticosteroid use, alcohol, SLE, sickle cell disease, post-traumatic.
- Pathophysiology: Loss of blood supply → osteocyte death → structural weakening → subchondral collapse → secondary OA.

#### 2. Popliteal Artery Entrapment
- ***Entrapment of popliteal artery with activity*** → ***patients present with intermittent claudication but lack atherosclerotic risk factors*** [2].
- Pathophysiology: Anomalous course of the popliteal artery relative to the gastrocnemius/popliteus → dynamic compression during exercise.
- Typically young, muscular patients.

---

### I. Neoplastic

- **Benign**: Osteochondroma, giant cell tumour (around the knee is the most common location), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS).
- **Malignant**: ***Osteosarcoma*** (most common primary malignant bone tumour in adolescents; distal femur/proximal tibia is the classic site), ***Ewing's sarcoma*** [4], chondrosarcoma, metastatic disease (in elderly).
- ***Synovial chondromatosis*** [1]: Metaplasia of the synovium → formation of cartilaginous loose bodies within the joint. Causes mechanical symptoms (locking, catching) and progressive OA.

---

### J. Other / Rare

- ***Sarcoidosis*** [1]: Can cause acute or chronic arthritis, typically of the ankle but also knee.
- ***Paget's disease of bone*** [1]: ***Predilection for skull, T-L spine, pelvis, LL long bones*** [10]. ***Pain is mild-moderate, deep persistent rest pain, ↑ with weightbearing and at night*** [10]. Can cause secondary arthritis of the knee.
- ***Haemophilia***: ***Haemarthrosis is the most common presentation (up to 80%), most commonly in major weight-bearing joints including the knee*** [7]. ***Target joint concept: a prior bleed results in joint damage and inflammation → predisposes to further bleeding. Haemophilic arthropathy: synovial hypertrophy, cartilage destruction, secondary OA*** [7].
- Chronic compartment syndrome: ***Typically affects young heavy-muscled athletes. Reversible form of acute compartment syndrome that develops when increased hydrostatic pressure within a skeletal muscle compartment compromises local tissue perfusion*** [2].
- ***Psychogenic factors relevant, especially with possible injury compensation*** [1].

## Classification

Knee pain can be classified by several frameworks:

### By Anatomical Location
| Location | Common Causes |
|---|---|
| **Anterior** | Patellofemoral syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, prepatellar bursitis, Osgood-Schlatter, patellar fracture/dislocation, quadriceps tendon rupture, fat pad impingement |
| **Medial** | Medial meniscal tear, MCL injury, pes anserine bursitis, medial OA, medial plica syndrome |
| **Lateral** | ***ITBS*** (most common cause of lateral knee pain), lateral meniscal tear, LCL injury, lateral OA, proximal tibiofibular joint pathology |
| **Posterior** | ***Baker's cyst***, PCL injury, posterior meniscal tear, popliteal artery entrapment, DVT, referred from hip/spine |
| **Diffuse** | OA (advanced), RA, septic arthritis, crystal arthropathy, fracture |

### By Onset
- **Acute** (< 2 weeks): Trauma (ligament/meniscal injury, fracture), septic arthritis, crystal arthritis, haemarthrosis
- **Chronic** ( > 6 weeks): OA, chronic meniscal degeneration, patellofemoral syndrome, overuse injuries, referred pain

### By Age (see Paediatric section above)

### By Mechanism
- **Traumatic**: Ligament tears, meniscal tears, fractures, dislocations
- **Atraumatic**: OA, crystal arthritis, septic arthritis, referred pain, neoplasm

---

## Clinical Features

### A. Symptoms (with Pathophysiological Basis)

#### 1. Pain
- **Character and location** help localise the structure:
  - ***Knee pain worse on going downstairs***: ***Patellofemoral joint involvement*** [3]. Why? Going downstairs requires eccentric contraction of the quadriceps against a flexed knee → maximal patellofemoral contact pressure at 30–60° flexion → pain from damaged patellofemoral cartilage.
  - Pain worse going **upstairs**: More suggestive of tibiofemoral OA or meniscal pathology (weight-bearing load).
  - Pain at rest / night pain: Concerning for infection, malignancy, AVN, or advanced OA (bone-on-bone). ***Paget's disease: deep persistent rest pain, ↑ with weightbearing and at night*** [10].
  - Pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest: OA pattern. Why? Activity increases mechanical stress on damaged cartilage.
  - Pain at specific point in arc of motion ("clunk"): Meniscal tear or loose body catching.

- **Onset**:
  - Sudden onset with trauma: Ligament injury, fracture, meniscal tear, dislocation.
  - Sudden onset without trauma: Crystal arthritis (gout/pseudogout), septic arthritis, spontaneous osteonecrosis.
  - Gradual onset: OA, overuse injuries, referred pain.

- **Radiation**:
  - Pain referred from hip → anterior/medial knee (obturator nerve L2-L4).
  - Pain referred from spine → follows dermatomal distribution (L3 → medial knee, L4 → anteromedial leg, L5 → lateral leg).

#### 2. Swelling
- **Rapid swelling (within 2 hours)**: **Haemarthrosis** — blood in the joint. Think: ACL tear (70% of acute haemarthroses), patellar dislocation, osteochondral fracture, peripheral meniscal tear, tibial plateau fracture. Why so fast? Disruption of a vascular structure → blood pours into joint space.
- **Gradual swelling (over 24–48 hours)**: Reactive effusion from meniscal tear, ligament sprain, OA flare, early infection. Why slower? Synovial inflammation and increased fluid production take time.
- **Intermittent swelling**: OA (effusion with flares), crystal arthritis (episodic).
- **Continuous swelling**: Capsule thickening (chronic OA, RA), chronic synovitis.
- **Posterior swelling**: Baker's cyst.

#### 3. ***Stiffness***
- ***Morning stiffness < 30 minutes after immobility*** → OA pattern [3]. Why? Overnight immobility → thickening of synovial fluid → takes a few minutes for the joint to "loosen up."
- Morning stiffness > 30–60 minutes → inflammatory arthritis (RA, crystal arthritis, spondyloarthropathy). Why? Active synovial inflammation → significant fluid accumulation and capsular distension → takes longer to resolve.
- ***Stiffness, locking of joints, instability*** [3].

#### 4. Mechanical Symptoms
- **Locking**: Inability to fully extend the knee.
  - **True locking**: A physical block — displaced bucket-handle meniscal tear, loose body. The knee is stuck in a fixed degree of flexion and cannot be passively extended.
  - **Pseudo-locking**: Pain-mediated inhibition of extension (effusion, patellofemoral pain). The knee CAN be passively extended but the patient won't due to pain.
- **Catching/Clicking**: Intermittent sensation of something catching inside the joint. Meniscal tear, plica, chondral flap.
- **Giving way**: Sudden unexpected buckling.
  - Ligamentous instability (ACL deficiency → giving way during pivoting).
  - Quadriceps weakness / inhibition (pain → reflex quadriceps inhibition → leg buckles).
  - Meniscal tear → locked fragment momentarily blocks movement.
  - Patellofemoral instability → patellar subluxation.

#### 5. Reduced Function
- **Difficulty with stairs** (patellofemoral), **squatting** (meniscal/posterior horn), **walking** (generalised OA), **running/pivoting** (ACL).
- ***Loss of function*** [3], ***deformity*** [3].

#### 6. Systemic Symptoms
- Fever, malaise, weight loss → think infection (septic arthritis), malignancy, inflammatory arthritis.
- Skin rash → psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, gonococcal arthritis, SLE.
- Preceding sore throat/diarrhoea/urethritis → reactive arthritis (post-streptococcal, post-enteric, post-urogenital).

### B. Signs (with Pathophysiological Basis)

#### 1. Inspection
- **Swelling**: Effusion (suprapatellar pouch fullness, loss of normal knee contour), localised bursal swelling (prepatellar, infrapatellar), Baker's cyst (posterior).
- ***Deformity***: ***Genu varum*** (bow-legged — medial OA), ***genu valgum*** (knock-kneed — lateral OA), ***fixed flexion deformity*** (posterior capsule contracture in severe OA/RA).
  - ***Flexion deformity: extension lag (correctable on passive) vs fixed flexion contracture*** [3].
    - **Extension lag**: The examiner can passively extend the knee fully, but the patient cannot actively do so. This indicates quadriceps weakness (e.g., after patella fracture, post-operative).
    - **Fixed flexion contracture**: The knee cannot be fully extended even passively. This indicates posterior capsule/ligament contracture (chronic OA, RA).
- **Muscle wasting**: Quadriceps atrophy (especially VMO) — occurs rapidly with disuse from pain. Measure thigh circumference 10–15 cm above the patella bilaterally.
- **Skin changes**: Erythema (infection, crystal arthritis, cellulitis), surgical scars, psoriatic plaques, tophaceous deposits (gout).
- **Alignment**: Varus/valgus deformity. Recurvatum (hyperextension — PCL deficiency or generalised hypermobility).

#### 2. Palpation
- **Warmth**: Indicates active inflammation (septic arthritis, crystal arthritis, RA flare, acute meniscal tear). Compare with the opposite knee.
- **Tenderness**:
  - **Joint line tenderness** (medial or lateral): Meniscal tear, OA, early chondral damage. The joint line is palpated with the knee at 90° flexion.
  - **Medial/lateral collateral ligament tenderness**: MCL/LCL injury.
  - **Tibial tuberosity tenderness**: Osgood-Schlatter, patellar tendinopathy (at inferior pole of patella).
  - **Pes anserine tenderness**: Below medial joint line — pes anserine bursitis.
  - **Lateral femoral condyle tenderness**: ITBS.
- **Effusion**:
  - **Bulge test** (sweep test): For small effusions. Milk fluid from medial parapatellar gutter → then stroke lateral side → watch for bulge returning on medial side.
  - **Patellar tap**: For moderate effusions. Compress suprapatellar pouch → push patella sharply against femur → feel a "tap." Not sensitive for large or small effusions.
  - **Ballottement**: For large effusions.
- ***Bony enlargement at affected joints*** [3] — Osteophyte formation in OA.
- ***Crepitus***: ***Reduced ROM with crepitations*** [3]. Why? Roughened cartilage surfaces grating against each other during movement. Fine crepitus = cartilage; coarse crepitus = bone-on-bone.

#### 3. Range of Motion
- Normal knee ROM: 0° (full extension) to ~135–150° (full flexion). Some individuals have 5–10° hyperextension.
- ***Limited ROM with crepitus*** [3] — hallmark of OA.
- Active ROM limited more than passive ROM → suggests pain or muscle weakness.
- Passive ROM limited → suggests mechanical block (meniscal tear, loose body, capsular contracture).

#### 4. Special Tests

| Test | What It Tests | Positive Finding | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lachman test** | ACL | Increased anterior translation with soft/absent endpoint at 20–30° flexion | ACL is the primary restraint to anterior tibial translation |
| **Anterior drawer** | ACL | Anterior translation at 90° flexion | Same as above but less sensitive (hamstrings guard at 90°) |
| **Pivot shift** | ACL | Sudden reduction (clunk) of subluxed lateral tibial plateau during extension→flexion with valgus + internal rotation | Demonstrates dynamic rotatory instability from ACL deficiency |
| **Posterior drawer** | PCL | Posterior translation at 90° flexion | PCL prevents posterior tibial displacement |
| **Posterior sag sign** | PCL | Tibia sags posteriorly with hip and knee at 90° | Gravity pulls tibia posteriorly without PCL restraint |
| **Valgus stress (30°)** | MCL | Increased medial opening | MCL resists valgus force |
| **Varus stress (30°)** | LCL | Increased lateral opening | LCL resists varus force |
| **McMurray test** | Meniscus | Pain/click during extension from full flexion with tibial rotation | Trapped meniscal fragment is compressed between condyle and plateau |
| **Apley grind test** | Meniscus | Pain with axial compression + rotation in prone position | Compresses torn meniscus between femur and tibia |
| **Thessaly test** | Meniscus | Pain/locking at 20° flexion while rotating on single leg | Loads the meniscus dynamically |
| ***Grind test (axial compression)*** | ***Small joints: OA*** [3] | Pain with axial loading | Damaged cartilage surfaces compressed together |
| **Patellar apprehension** | Patellar instability | Patient anxiety/guarding when patella pushed laterally | Prior dislocation → fear of recurrence |
| ***Noble's test*** | ***ITBS*** [3] | ***Pain over lateral femoral condyle at 30° flexion*** | IT band tightest over lateral epicondyle at ~30° |
| ***Renne test*** | ***ITBS*** [3] | Pain with single-leg squat at 30° flexion | Same mechanism |

#### 5. Neurovascular Examination
- **Always check distal pulses** (dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial) after trauma — especially knee dislocation (popliteal artery injury risk up to 40%).
- **Peroneal nerve function**: Dorsiflexion (L4-L5) and eversion — ask patient to walk on heels. Common peroneal nerve wraps around the fibular neck and is vulnerable.
- **Sensation**: Dermatomal distribution to assess for referred pain; also check for peripheral neuropathy.

## Degenerative vs. Inflammatory Arthritis — A Key Distinction

| Feature | Degenerative (OA) | Inflammatory (RA, Crystal) |
|---|---|---|
| Morning stiffness | ***< 30 min*** | > 30–60 min |
| Pain pattern | Worse with use, better with rest | May be worse at rest, improves with use |
| Swelling | Bony (osteophytes), intermittent effusion | Soft, boggy synovitis, persistent |
| Warmth | Mild or absent | Significant |
| Joint distribution | ***Weight-bearing joints*** | Small joints of hands/feet (RA), any (gout) |
| Systemic features | Absent | Present (fever, fatigue, weight loss) |
| Radiographic | LOSS (Loss of joint space, Osteophytes, Subchondral cysts/sclerosis) | Periarticular osteopenia, erosions, uniform joint space narrowing |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **OA is the commonest cause of knee pain in HK**, especially in the elderly. Key radiographic features = **LOSS** (Loss of joint space, Osteophytes, Subchondral cysts, Subchondral sclerosis). Kellgren-Lawrence grading system classifies severity (Grade 0–4). Always assess all 3 compartments with appropriate views.

2. **Anatomy dictates presentation**: Medial meniscus tears are more common (attached to MCL); ACL injuries cause haemarthrosis within 2 hours; Baker's cysts arise from underlying joint disease and can rupture to mimic DVT.

3. **Septic arthritis is an emergency**: Hot, swollen, tender joint = septic arthritis until proven otherwise. Knee is the most common site. S. aureus is the most common organism.

4. **Crystal arthritis**: Gout (MSU crystals, negatively birefringent) vs. pseudogout (CPPD crystals, positively birefringent, chondrocalcinosis on X-ray). Always screen for metabolic causes of CPPD in young patients.

5. **In children, always examine the hip**: SCFE and Perthes disease refer pain to the knee via the obturator nerve. Know the age-related differential.

6. **IT band syndrome**: Most common cause of lateral knee pain. Pain at 30° flexion over lateral femoral condyle.

7. **Meniscal tear management** depends on zone: outer 1/3 = repair; inner 2/3 = partial meniscectomy. Bucket-handle tears and locked knees need surgery.

8. **Masquerades**: Always consider referred pain from hip/spine, depression, diabetes (Charcot arthropathy, neuropathy), and psychogenic factors.
