## Complications of Menstrual and Vaginal Complaints

Complications arise either from the **underlying condition itself** (e.g. PID → tubal damage → infertility) or from **treatment** (e.g. hysterectomy → surgical complications). I'll systematically cover both, grouped by clinical scenario, always linking back to pathophysiology so you understand *why* each complication occurs rather than just memorising lists.

### 1. Complications of Abnormal Uterine Bleeding

#### 1A. Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA)

This is the single most common systemic complication of chronic heavy menstrual bleeding.

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pathophysiology** | Chronic menstrual blood loss → ongoing loss of iron (each mL of blood contains ~0.5 mg iron). When loss exceeds dietary absorption (~1–2 mg/day), iron stores deplete → ferritin falls → serum iron falls → transferrin rises (body "reaches" for more iron) → insufficient iron for haem synthesis → microcytic hypochromic anaemia |
| **Prevalence** | IDA is ***present in ~20% of females, especially at childbearing age*** [3]. HMB is the commonest cause of IDA in premenopausal women. |
| **Clinical features** | Fatigue, pallor, exertional dyspnoea, palpitations, dizziness, pica (craving ice or soil), koilonychia (spoon nails), glossitis, angular cheilitis |
| **Diagnosis** | ↓Hb, ↓MCV, ↓ferritin (< 30 μg/L is diagnostic; < 15 confirms depletion), ↓serum iron, ↑TIBC, ↓transferrin saturation |
| **Management** | Oral iron (ferrous sulphate 200 mg BD–TDS, contains ~65 mg elemental iron per tablet) for ≥ 3 months beyond normalisation of Hb to replenish stores. IV iron (ferric carboxymaltose) if oral intolerant, severe anaemia, or rapid correction needed. **Crucially**: treat the underlying cause of HMB simultaneously. |
| **Why it matters** | Anaemia impairs quality of life, work productivity, exercise tolerance, and cognition. Severe anaemia can precipitate high-output cardiac failure. In pregnancy, untreated IDA ↑risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight. |

<Callout title="Exam Pearl">
Menorrhagia (HMB) is the **commonest cause of iron deficiency anaemia in premenopausal women**. Conversely, if a premenopausal woman presents with IDA, always ask about her periods — HMB is the answer until proven otherwise [3].
</Callout>

#### 1B. Endometrial Hyperplasia and Carcinoma

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pathophysiology** | Chronic anovulation → **unopposed oestrogen** → continuous endometrial proliferation without progesterone-induced secretory transformation or shedding → progressive endometrial hyperplasia → if undetected, can progress to atypical hyperplasia → endometrial carcinoma (risk ~30% for atypical hyperplasia). |
| **At-risk populations** | PCOS, obesity (peripheral aromatisation), perimenopausal anovulation, tamoxifen use, oestrogen-secreting tumours |
| **Prevention** | Regular progestogen opposition (LNG-IUS, cyclical progestogens, COCP) in any woman with chronic anovulation to prevent endometrial hyperplasia |
| **Why this complication is important** | Endometrial cancer incidence is **rising** in HK and globally, driven largely by the obesity epidemic and metabolic syndrome [4] |

#### 1C. Impact on Quality of Life and Mental Health

This is under-recognised but extremely real:
- Chronic HMB or unpredictable bleeding → social embarrassment, activity restriction, missed work/school
- Chronic pelvic pain (endometriosis, adenomyosis) → depression, anxiety, relationship strain
- ***Masquerades checklist: Depression*** [1] — always consider depression as a coexisting condition (and sometimes a masquerading cause for the complaint itself)
- ***"Is the patient trying to tell me something?" — Can be very relevant. Consider various problems and sexual dysfunction*** [1]

#### 1D. Haemorrhagic Shock (Acute Severe AUB)

- Rare but life-threatening, especially with ruptured ectopic pregnancy, massive fibroid haemorrhage, or coagulopathy
- ***Causes of haemorrhagic hypovolaemic shock include ruptured ectopic pregnancy, post-partum haemorrhage, uterine or vaginal haemorrhage, spontaneous haemorrhage due to bleeding diathesis*** [18]
- ***Clinical features: ↑sympathetic outflow → vasoconstriction → pallor, peripheral cyanosis, cold extremities, delayed capillary refill, empty peripheral veins, tachycardia, sweating*** [18]

### 2. Complications of Specific Menstrual Conditions

#### 2A. Fibroids (Leiomyomata)

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Presentation |
|---|---|---|
| **Anaemia** (from chronic HMB) | Submucosal fibroids → ↑endometrial surface area + fragile vasculature → chronic blood loss | Fatigue, pallor, microcytic anaemia |
| **Pressure effects** | Large fibroids compress adjacent organs | Urinary frequency/retention (anterior fibroid compresses bladder), constipation (posterior fibroid compresses rectum), ureteric obstruction → hydronephrosis (lateral cervical fibroids) |
| **Degeneration** | Fibroid outgrows blood supply → ischaemic necrosis. Types: hyaline (commonest, asymptomatic), red/carneous (pregnancy — acute pain), cystic, calcific (postmenopausal) | Acute pelvic pain, tenderness over fibroid, low-grade fever |
| **Torsion** | Pedunculated subserosal fibroid twists on its stalk → vascular compromise | Acute abdominal pain, mimics ovarian torsion |
| **Infertility** | Submucosal fibroids distort cavity → impaired implantation. Large intramural fibroids may compress tubal ostia | Subfertility, recurrent miscarriage |
| **Pregnancy complications** | Fibroids are oestrogen/progesterone-responsive → grow during pregnancy | Miscarriage, preterm labour, malpresentation (fibroid occupies pelvis → breech), obstructed labour, postpartum haemorrhage (impaired myometrial contraction) |
| **Malignant transformation** | Leiomyosarcoma — extremely rare (< 0.5% of fibroids). Controversial whether it arises from pre-existing fibroids or de novo | Rapid growth (especially postmenopausal), pain. Suspect if fibroid grows after menopause. |

#### 2B. Endometriosis

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Infertility** | Adhesions distort tubal-ovarian anatomy → impaired ovum pick-up. Endometriomas damage ovarian tissue. Peritoneal inflammation creates hostile environment for sperm/embryo. Altered endometrial receptivity. Present in 25–50% of infertile women. |
| **Chronic pelvic pain** | Cyclical inflammation, fibrosis, nerve infiltration by deep endometriotic nodules → central sensitisation → pain becomes chronic and neuropathic |
| **Ovarian endometrioma ("chocolate cyst")** | Ectopic endometrial tissue on ovary → cyclical bleeding within cyst → accumulation of old blood (dark brown = "chocolate") → progressive enlargement. Risk of rupture (chemical peritonitis from spillage of cyst contents). Risk of malignant transformation (endometrioid or clear cell ovarian carcinoma — rare but recognised, ~1%) |
| **Adhesions** | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → organs become adherent (e.g. ovary stuck to pelvic sidewall, bowel adherent to uterus, obliterated Pouch of Douglas) → pain, bowel/ureteric obstruction |
| ***Fistula formation*** | Deep infiltrating endometriosis can penetrate bowel wall, bladder, or vagina. ***Enterovaginal fistula → passage of gas or faeces through vagina*** [25]. Rare but documented. |
| **Bladder/ureteric involvement** | Endometriotic implants on bladder → cyclical haematuria (catamenial haematuria). Ureteric involvement → obstruction → hydronephrosis |

#### 2C. Adenomyosis

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Progressive dysmenorrhoea** | Intramyometrial endometrial tissue swells cyclically → worsening pain with each cycle |
| **HMB + IDA** | Enlarged uterus + impaired myometrial contraction → chronic heavy bleeding |
| **Infertility** | Altered junctional zone contractility → impaired implantation. Often coexists with endometriosis. |

#### 2D. PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)

PCOS is far more than a menstrual complaint — its complications are metabolic, reproductive, and psychological:

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Endometrial hyperplasia / carcinoma** | Chronic anovulation → unopposed oestrogen (as above). Risk 2–6× increased. |
| ***Type 2 diabetes mellitus*** | ***Insulin resistance*** → hyperinsulinaemia → eventual β-cell failure → T2DM. ***PCOS is a manifestation of metabolic syndrome*** [4] |
| ***Dyslipidaemia*** | Insulin resistance → ↑hepatic VLDL production → ↑TG, ↓HDL-C, ↑LDL-C [4] |
| ***Cardiovascular disease*** | Clustering of risk factors: obesity, HTN, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, chronic inflammation |
| ***Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease*** | ***Manifestation of metabolic syndrome*** [4] |
| **Infertility** | Anovulation → inability to conceive. PCOS is the commonest cause of anovulatory infertility. |
| **Obstructive sleep apnoea** | Obesity + possible androgen effects on upper airway → OSA. Prevalence markedly ↑ in PCOS. |
| **Psychological** | Depression, anxiety, poor self-esteem (related to hirsutism, acne, obesity, infertility) |
| **Pregnancy complications** | If conception achieved (often with ovulation induction): ↑risk of gestational DM, pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, C-section |

### 3. Complications of Vaginal/Cervical Infections

#### 3A. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) — Complications

PID is the single most important complication of untreated cervicitis (Chlamydia, gonorrhoea). Its complications are devastating and often irreversible.

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Tubal factor infertility** | Salpingitis → tubal mucosal damage → fibrosis → tubal occlusion or impaired ciliary function → ova cannot be transported → infertility. Risk: ~10% after 1 episode, ~25% after 2, ~50% after 3 episodes. | Most feared long-term complication. Often "silent" PID (subclinical Chlamydia) causes damage without the patient ever knowing she had PID. |
| **Ectopic pregnancy** | Tubal damage impairs transport of fertilised ovum → implantation occurs in damaged tube → ectopic pregnancy. Risk ↑6–10× after PID. | ***Ectopic pregnancy remains a potentially lethal condition so always be "ectopic minded"*** [1] |
| **Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA)** | Extension of infection → walled-off collection of pus involving tube, ovary, and adjacent structures | Persistent fever despite antibiotics, palpable tender mass. May require drainage (USS-guided or surgical). Rupture → generalised peritonitis → sepsis → life-threatening emergency. |
| ***Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome*** | ***Perihepatitis*** — infection spreads along paracolic gutters or via lymphatics/haematogenous route → inflammation of liver capsule (Glisson's capsule) → "violin string" adhesions between liver surface and anterior abdominal wall [22] | RUQ pain mimicking cholecystitis or biliary colic. Can be missed if PID not considered. Elevated LFTs sometimes present. |
| **Chronic pelvic pain** | Post-inflammatory adhesions → traction on pelvic organs → chronic intermittent pain. Altered pain processing (central sensitisation). | Present in ~18% of women post-PID |
| ***Peritonitis*** | ***Spread of infection beyond adnexa*** [22] | Generalised abdominal tenderness, guarding, rigidity — surgical emergency |
| ***Obstetric complications*** | ***Ectopic pregnancy, prematurity, premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, septic abortion, post-abortal PID*** [22] | Underscores the importance of pre-conception STI screening |

<Callout title="Why Chlamydia Screening Matters So Much" type="error">
***Chlamydia*** is often completely asymptomatic (up to 70% of women) yet causes "silent" salpingitis → tubal damage → infertility and ectopic pregnancy. By the time the patient presents with infertility, the damage is done and irreversible. This is why opportunistic screening of sexually active young women is so important — ***Chlamydia PCR*** [1] catches the infection before it ascends.
</Callout>

#### 3B. Complications of Gonorrhoea

***Complications of untreated gonorrhoea in females:*** [22]
- ***Pelvic inflammatory disease***
- ***Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome***
- ***Peritonitis***
- ***Bartholinitis***
- ***Infertility***
- ***Obstetric complications: ectopic pregnancy, prematurity, PROM, chorioamnionitis, septic abortion, post-abortal PID***

***In children:*** [22]
- ***Vulvovaginitis***
- ***Ophthalmia neonatorum*** (gonococcal conjunctivitis of the newborn — acquired during passage through infected birth canal → purulent discharge within days of birth → corneal ulceration → blindness if untreated. Prevented by prophylactic eye drops at birth.)

***Disseminated gonococcal infection (0.5–3%):*** [22]
- ***Purulent arthritis or triad of tenosynovitis, dermatitis, polyarthralgia***
- ***Can affect endocardium and meninges***

#### 3C. Complications of Genital Herpes (HSV)

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Recurrent episodes** | HSV establishes latency in sacral dorsal root ganglia (S2–S4) → periodic reactivation triggered by stress, illness, immunosuppression, menses, UV exposure → recurrent vesicular eruptions |
| **Neonatal herpes** | Transmission during vaginal delivery when active lesions present → devastating neonatal infection (disseminated disease, encephalitis, skin-eye-mouth disease). Mortality up to 30% for disseminated disease. This is why ***patients must be educated to report HSV history to obstetricians*** [23]. Active primary genital herpes at time of delivery → Caesarean section recommended. |
| **Urinary retention** | Sacral radiculitis (HSV-induced inflammation of sacral nerve roots) → neurogenic bladder → acute urinary retention |
| **Meningitis** | HSV meningitis (Mollaret's meningitis if recurrent) — usually benign and self-limiting but distressing |
| **Psychological impact** | Significant anxiety, shame, relationship difficulties — often disproportionate to the actual clinical severity |

#### 3D. Complications of Trichomoniasis

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Pregnancy complications** | Untreated trichomoniasis associated with preterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight |
| **HIV acquisition** | Trichomoniasis causes mucosal inflammation → breaks in epithelial barrier + recruitment of CD4+ T cells to inflamed mucosa → ↑susceptibility to HIV acquisition (estimated 1.5–2× increased risk) |
| **Recurrent/persistent infection** | "Ping-pong infection" if partner not treated [22] |

#### 3E. Complications of Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Pregnancy complications** | BV associated with preterm labour, PPROM, chorioamnionitis, postpartum endometritis. Anaerobic bacteria ascend → decidual inflammation → prostaglandin release → preterm contractions |
| **Post-surgical infection** | BV prior to gynaecological surgery (hysterectomy, D&C, termination) → ↑risk of post-operative pelvic infection. This is why some centres screen and treat BV before planned procedures |
| **↑STI acquisition** | Disrupted vaginal flora → ↓protective lactobacilli → ↑susceptibility to Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV |

---

### 4. Complications of Specific Treatments

#### 4A. Complications of Hormonal Therapy

| Treatment | Complications | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| **COCP** | VTE (DVT, PE), arterial thromboembolism (stroke, MI — especially in migraine with aura), breast cancer (small ↑risk), cervical cancer (modest ↑risk with prolonged use), hepatic adenoma (rare) | Oestrogen → ↑hepatic synthesis of clotting factors (fibrinogen, II, VII, X) → prothrombotic state. ↓antithrombin III. |
| **Progestogen-only methods (DMPA)** | Irregular bleeding, weight gain, ↓bone mineral density (reversible after cessation), delayed return of fertility (DMPA) | DMPA suppresses ovulation → hypo-oestrogenic state → ↓osteoblast activity → bone loss |
| **GnRH agonists** | Menopausal symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, mood changes), osteoporosis (if used > 6 months without add-back therapy) | Pituitary desensitisation → ↓FSH/LH → ↓oestrogen → "medical menopause" |
| **LNG-IUS** | Irregular bleeding/spotting (first 3–6 months), hormonal side effects (acne, breast tenderness, mood changes — usually mild), perforation (rare, ~1/1000 insertions), expulsion (~5%) | Local progestogenic effects; mechanical complications during insertion |
| **Tamoxifen** | Endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer (↑2–7×), VTE | Tamoxifen is anti-oestrogenic on breast but **pro-oestrogenic on endometrium** (partial agonist) |

#### 4B. Complications of Surgical Treatment

| Procedure | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Hysterectomy** | **Early**: haemorrhage, infection (wound, vault, UTI), VTE, anaesthetic complications, bladder/ureteric/bowel injury (0.5–1%). **Late**: vaginal vault prolapse (loss of uterosacral ligament support), premature menopause (if ovaries removed — "surgical menopause" → need HRT), sexual dysfunction, psychological impact |
| **Myomectomy** | Haemorrhage (may require blood transfusion), infection, uterine scar → risk of uterine rupture in future pregnancy (especially if myometrium breached deeply), adhesion formation → future infertility or pain, recurrence of fibroids (~15–30% over 5 years) |
| **Endometrial ablation** | Failure (return of bleeding), haematometra (blood trapped behind cervical stenosis or tubal obstruction), uterine perforation (rare), pregnancy after ablation (dangerous — abnormal placentation, ectopic, miscarriage) → must use contraception |
| **Hysteroscopy** | Uterine perforation (0.1–1%), fluid overload (from distension media — can cause hyponatraemia, pulmonary oedema), infection, cervical laceration |
| **Laparoscopy (for endometriosis, ectopic, torsion)** | Port-site bleeding/hernia, visceral injury (bowel, bladder, vascular), gas embolism (very rare), shoulder-tip pain (diaphragmatic irritation from CO₂), adhesion formation |
| **Uterine artery embolisation (UAE)** | Post-embolisation syndrome (pain, fever, nausea — self-limiting), fibroid expulsion (if submucosal → may pass per vagina), premature ovarian failure (non-target embolisation of ovarian blood supply — ↑risk in women > 45), infection, very rarely uterine necrosis |

#### 4C. Complications of Methotrexate (for Ectopic Pregnancy)

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Treatment failure** | ~10–15% of single-dose methotrexate fails → β-hCG does not decline adequately → requires repeat dose or surgical intervention |
| **Tubal rupture** | Can occur even after starting methotrexate (particularly in first week as trophoblastic tissue initially swells before regressing) → patients must be counselled to present immediately with severe pain/haemodynamic instability |
| **Bone marrow suppression** | Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase → ↓DNA synthesis in all rapidly dividing cells → ↓WBC, platelets, RBCs. Usually mild at doses used for ectopic. |
| **Hepatotoxicity** | Direct hepatotoxic effect → monitor LFTs |
| **Stomatitis, GI upset** | Mucositis from inhibition of rapidly dividing GI epithelial cells |

---

### 5. Complications of Tampon Use — Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)

This is specifically highlighted in the lecture slides as a ***serious disorder not to be missed*** [1].

***Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome:*** [26]
- ***Cause: various exotoxins from S. aureus → acts as superantigens to activate large numbers of T cells → systemic inflammation ensues***
- ***Classically associated with use of tampons and nasal packing for epistaxis, but ≥ 1/2 are non-menstrual related***
- ***Clinical features develop rapidly (≤ 48h):***
  - ***Hypotension: sBP ≤ 90 mmHg due to widespread 3rd-spacing***
  - ***Skin: widespread erythematous, macular desquamating rash (sunburn-like) involving palms and soles ± mucosal involvement (eye, vaginal, oropharynx)***
  - ***Multiorgan failure***

| Feature | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Why tampons?** | Prolonged retention of absorbent tampon → creates warm, moist, protein-rich environment ideal for S. aureus proliferation → if toxin-producing strain (TSST-1), superantigen is absorbed through vaginal mucosa → massive non-specific T-cell activation (~20% of T cells, vs < 0.01% in conventional antigen response) → cytokine storm → capillary leak, hypotension, multiorgan failure |
| **Management** | Remove tampon immediately. IV antistaphylococcal antibiotics (flucloxacillin/clindamycin — clindamycin specifically inhibits toxin production). Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation. ICU for organ support. |
| **Prevention** | Use lowest-absorbency tampon needed, change regularly (every 4–8 hours), alternate with pads |

---

### 6. Complications Relating to Vulvovaginal Conditions

#### 6A. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome / Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis — Vulvovaginal Sequelae

While SJS/TEN is primarily a dermatological emergency, its vulvovaginal complications are frequently overlooked and highly relevant to this topic:

***Vulvovaginal complications of SJS/TEN:*** [27]
- ***Acute phase: erosive/ulcerative vaginitis, vulvar bullae, urethritis (up to 2/3) ± urinary retention and genital erosions***
- ***Long-term sequelae: labial agglutination, introital stenosis, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, urinary retention, haematocolpos*** [27]

These complications occur because the vulvovaginal epithelium (mucosal surface) is involved in the same full-thickness epidermal necrosis that affects the skin → healing by secondary intention → scarring → adhesion formation → stenosis.

#### 6B. Sexual Dysfunction

***Sexual dysfunction is very common in women with menstrual/vaginal complaints:*** [28]
- ***Lack of sexual interest (40% prevalence in women at 6-month assessment)***
- ***Inability of orgasm (14%)***
- ***Pain during coitus (12%)***
- ***Anxiety on performance (7%)***

| Cause | Mechanism of Sexual Dysfunction |
|---|---|
| **Chronic dyspareunia** (endometriosis, atrophic vaginitis, PID sequelae) | Pain during intercourse → avoidance behaviour → ↓desire → relationship strain |
| **Vaginismus** | Involuntary spasm of pelvic floor muscles (often psychogenic or post-traumatic) → inability to achieve penetration |
| **Vulvodynia** | Chronic vulval pain syndrome of unknown aetiology → pain with touch/intercourse |
| **Post-hysterectomy** | Some women report altered sexual sensation (loss of uterine contractions during orgasm, cervical stimulation). Evidence mixed — many women report improved sexual function after resolution of HMB/pain. |
| **Psychological** | Depression, anxiety, body image issues (PCOS — hirsutism, obesity), relationship difficulties, history of sexual abuse |

***"Is the patient trying to tell me something? — Needs careful consideration; possible sexual dysfunction"*** [1]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications">

1. **IDA** is the commonest complication of chronic HMB — present in ~20% of reproductive-age women [3]. Always check Hb and ferritin.

2. **Chronic anovulation → unopposed oestrogen → endometrial hyperplasia → carcinoma**. This sequence is preventable with progestogen opposition.

3. **PID complications** are devastating and often irreversible: tubal infertility (~10% per episode), ectopic pregnancy (6–10× risk), chronic pelvic pain, TOA. ***Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome*** (perihepatitis) can mimic biliary disease [22].

4. **Chlamydia** is the "silent" destroyer — up to 70% asymptomatic, yet causes tubal damage → infertility. ***Chlamydia PCR screening*** is essential [1].

5. ***Ectopic pregnancy remains a potentially lethal condition — always be "ectopic minded"*** [1].

6. ***Tampon toxic shock syndrome*** is a serious, life-threatening complication caused by staphylococcal superantigens [1][26].

7. ***Gonorrhoea complications in females: PID, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis, peritonitis, bartholinitis, infertility, obstetric complications. In children: ophthalmia neonatorum*** [22].

8. **PCOS** is a metabolic syndrome — complications extend far beyond menstrual irregularity to include T2DM, CVD, NAFLD, and endometrial cancer [4].

9. **Surgical complications** of hysterectomy include bladder/ureteric injury (0.5–1%), VTE, vault prolapse, and surgical menopause if ovaries removed.

10. ***SJS/TEN vulvovaginal sequelae***: labial agglutination, introital stenosis, vaginal dryness, dyspareunia — often overlooked but cause significant long-term morbidity [27].
