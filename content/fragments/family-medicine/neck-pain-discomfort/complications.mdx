## Complications of Neck Pain/Discomfort and Its Underlying Conditions

When we talk about "complications" of neck pain, we are really discussing two interrelated categories:

1. **Complications of the underlying conditions** that cause neck pain — i.e., what happens if the disease progresses or is not treated
2. **Complications of the treatments** used for neck pain — both conservative and surgical

Both are high-yield exam topics. Let's work through them systematically from first principles.

### 1. Complications of Untreated or Progressive Underlying Conditions

#### 1.1 Cervical Spondylosis — The Degenerative Cascade and Its Consequences

Cervical spondylosis itself is the "probability diagnosis" [1] — the commonest cause of neck pain. Left untreated, the degenerative cascade produces increasingly serious consequences:

| Stage | Pathophysiology | Clinical Complication |
|---|---|---|
| **Axial pain only** | Facet degeneration, disc desiccation → nociceptor stimulation | Chronic pain, disability, reduced quality of life, psychological impact (depression, anxiety) |
| ***Radiculopathy*** | Osteophytes or disc prolapse encroach on the intervertebral foramen → nerve root compression | Persistent dermatomal pain, sensory loss, ***motor weakness and trophic changes (dry, scaly, inelastic, blue/cold skin) in long-standing compression*** [2]; muscle wasting due to chronic denervation |
| ***Myelopathy*** | Progressive spinal canal stenosis → cord compression → ischaemia + direct mechanical injury → demyelination and neuronal death | ***Weakness, numbness, clumsiness in arms with UMN signs*** [4]; gait instability; bladder/bowel dysfunction (late); **irreversible cord damage** if untreated — T2 signal change on MRI (myelomalacia) represents gliosis that will NOT recover |
| ***Instability*** | Loss of disc height + facet degeneration → segmental hypermobility | ***Instability*** [2] → abnormal motion → risk of acute cord compression with minor trauma (e.g., a fall causing hyperextension in a patient with pre-existing stenosis) |

> **Why is myelopathy the most feared complication of spondylosis?** Because the cervical cord carries ALL the motor and sensory pathways for the limbs, trunk, and autonomic function. Compression here causes a **global neurological catastrophe** — quadriparesis, sensory loss below the level, and sphincter dysfunction. Unlike peripheral nerves, the spinal cord has very limited capacity for regeneration.

<Callout title="The 'Minor Fall' Disaster" type="error">
A patient with pre-existing cervical stenosis who sustains a hyperextension injury (e.g., a simple fall) can develop **acute central cord syndrome** — disproportionate weakness in the upper limbs (because the central cord carries the cervical motor fibres) with relative sparing of the lower limbs. This is the classic complication of cervical spondylosis + minor trauma. Examiners love this scenario.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Whiplash — Complications and Chronicity

***Strains, sprains and microfractures of the facet joints, especially after a whiplash injury, are difficult to detect and are often overlooked as a cause of persistent pain*** [1].

| Complication | Mechanism | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **Chronic whiplash-associated disorder** | Central sensitisation + psychosocial factors (catastrophising, fear-avoidance, litigation) → persistent pain > 6 months | 20-40% of whiplash patients develop chronic symptoms |
| **Cervicogenic headache** | Upper cervical facet joint injury → referred pain via trigeminocervical nucleus → chronic occipital/temporal headache | Common |
| **Vertebral artery dissection** | Hyperextension/rotation injury tears the intima of the vertebral artery → intramural haematoma → posterior circulation stroke | Rare but catastrophic |
| **Disc herniation** | Acute annular tear from shear forces → delayed disc prolapse → radiculopathy or myelopathy | Uncommon; may present weeks to months after injury |
| **TMJ dysfunction** | Impact forces transmitted to TMJ → capsular injury, disc displacement → jaw pain, clicking, restricted opening | Often overlooked |

#### 1.3 Cervical Radiculopathy — Complications of Prolonged Nerve Root Compression

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Permanent motor deficit** | Prolonged compression → Wallerian degeneration of motor axons → denervation atrophy of myotomal muscles; reinnervation may be incomplete |
| **Chronic neuropathic pain** | Peripheral nerve injury → ectopic discharge from damaged axons + central sensitisation (wind-up in the dorsal horn) → persistent burning, shooting pain even after structural cause is addressed |
| ***Trophic changes*** | Chronic loss of sympathetic and trophic neural input to skin → ***dry, scaly, inelastic, blue/cold skin*** [2] |
| **Progression to myelopathy** | A large central disc herniation or progressive osteophytic narrowing that initially caused only root compression can eventually compress the cord |

#### 1.4 Cervical Myelopathy — Complications of Cord Compression

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Manifestation |
|---|---|---|
| **Irreversible quadriparesis** | Chronic cord compression → ischaemic necrosis of grey matter + demyelination of white matter → gliosis (myelomalacia) | Progressive UMN weakness of all four limbs; may be sudden if acute decompensation occurs |
| **Neurogenic bladder** | Loss of corticospinal tract input to the pontine micturition centre and sacral parasympathetic outflow → detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia | Urinary urgency, frequency → retention → overflow incontinence |
| **Bowel dysfunction** | Loss of voluntary control of external anal sphincter + impaired rectal sensation | Constipation, faecal incontinence (late) |
| **Autonomic dysreflexia** | Cord lesion above T6 → loss of descending sympathetic modulation → noxious stimulus below the level (e.g., bladder distension) triggers massive reflex sympathetic discharge → severe hypertension, bradycardia, flushing/sweating above the level | Medical emergency; usually in spinal cord injury but can occur in severe myelopathy |
| **Respiratory compromise** | High cervical cord compression (C3-C5 — phrenic nerve) → diaphragmatic weakness | Dyspnoea, sleep-disordered breathing, respiratory failure (rare unless very high lesion or acute injury) |

#### 1.5 Atlantoaxial Instability (RA) — Complications

The cervical spine in RA is a ticking time bomb:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Spastic quadriparesis, sensory and sphincter disturbance*** | Progressive atlantoaxial subluxation → cord compression at the cervicomedullary junction [8] |
| ***Basilar invagination → medullary compression*** [8] | C1/C2 invaginates into foramen magnum → compression of the medulla oblongata → respiratory arrest, cardiovascular collapse |
| **Sudden death** | Acute subluxation during intubation, minor trauma, or cervical manipulation → acute cord transection at cervicomedullary junction |
| **Vertebrobasilar insufficiency** | Subluxation kinks or compresses the vertebral arteries → posterior circulation ischaemia → vertigo, drop attacks, visual disturbance |

<Callout title="RA and Anaesthesia — A Lethal Combination If Not Anticipated" type="error">
***Patients with RA and cervical instability are at risk of severe injury and death due to a variety of insults including falls, whiplash injuries, and intubation*** [8]. Always screen RA patients for cervical instability before any procedure requiring intubation. Failure to do so is a recurring medicolegal issue.
</Callout>

#### 1.6 Arterial Dissection — Complications

***Presentation of complications of aortic dissection*** (applicable principles also to cervico-cephalic dissection) [3]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Ischaemic stroke** | Carotid dissection → intimal flap acts as nidus for thrombus → embolism to MCA territory; vertebral dissection → posterior circulation stroke (brainstem, cerebellum, occipital lobe) |
| ***Horner's syndrome*** | Intramural haematoma compresses postganglionic sympathetic fibres in the carotid sheath → ***miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis*** [3] |
| **Pseudoaneurysm** | Weakened vessel wall dilates → risk of rupture or further embolism |
| **Extension of dissection** | Dissection flap propagates proximally or distally → involves additional branch vessels → expanding territory of ischaemia |

#### 1.7 Vertebral Fracture/Dislocation — Complications

***Management of cervical spine injury — Prognosis*** [2]:
- ***Complete injury: recovery rare***
- ***Incomplete injury: most recovery occurs within ≤ 6 months, many can eventually walk with aids; loss of sphincter function is a poor prognostic factor***

Complications fall into **early** and **late** categories [14]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Early — Local** | ***Neurovascular injury*** [14] | Direct trauma to cord, nerve roots, or vertebral arteries |
| | ***Compartment syndrome*** [14] | Rarely in the neck per se, but relevant for associated limb injuries |
| | Wound infection / osteomyelitis | Open fractures, surgical wounds |
| **Early — Systemic** | DVT / PE | Immobility + hypercoagulable state from trauma; ***VTE prophylaxis essential*** [2] |
| | Aspiration pneumonia | Bulbar dysfunction in high cervical injuries; impaired cough in cord injury |
| | Stress ulceration | Cushing's ulcer (↑ ICP) or steroid-related; ***stress ulcer prophylaxis*** [2] |
| | Neurogenic shock | Cord injury above T6 → loss of sympathetic tone → bradycardia + hypotension (distributive shock) |
| **Late — Local** | ***Delayed/mal/non-union*** [14] | Inadequate immobilisation, poor blood supply, infection |
| | Post-traumatic kyphosis | Missed or inadequately treated compression fracture → progressive angular deformity |
| | Post-traumatic syringomyelia | CSF flow obstruction at injury site → intramedullary cystic cavity forms months to years later → progressive myelopathy |
| **Late — Systemic** | ***Pressure sores*** [2][14] | Prolonged immobility + sensory loss → tissue ischaemia → skin breakdown (sacrum, heels, occiput) |
| | ***Muscle atrophy and contractures*** [2][14] | Disuse and spasticity |
| | Chronic pain syndrome | Central neuropathic pain below the level of injury; extremely difficult to treat |
| | Depression | Very common post-SCI; screen actively |
| | Autonomic dysreflexia | As described above (lesion above T6) |

#### 1.8 Spinal Infection — Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Epidural abscess → cord compression** | Infection extends from disc/vertebral body into the epidural space → mass effect on the cord; surgical emergency |
| **Vertebral body destruction → pathological fracture → instability** | Osteomyelitis weakens cortical bone → collapse under axial load |
| **Septicaemia / septic shock** | Haematogenous seeding from vertebral focus; or vertebral infection as part of disseminated bacteraemia |
| **Paravertebral / psoas abscess** | TB spine characteristically produces large "cold" paravertebral abscesses that can track along fascial planes (e.g., psoas abscess presenting as groin mass) |
| **Kyphotic deformity** | Post-infective vertebral body collapse → angular kyphosis (gibbus deformity — classic of Pott's disease) |

#### 1.9 Complications of Specific "Pitfall" and "Masquerade" Conditions

| Condition | Key Complications |
|---|---|
| ***Fibromyalgia*** [1] | Chronic disability, opioid dependence (from inappropriate prescribing), depression, social withdrawal |
| ***Ankylosing spondylitis*** [1] | Chalk-stick fractures through fused spine (even from minimal trauma → high risk of cord injury); anterior uveitis; aortitis/AR; pulmonary fibrosis; cauda equina syndrome (rare) |
| ***PMR / GCA*** [1] | GCA → ***permanent blindness due to arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (AAION)***; posterior circulation stroke from basilar artery thrombosis [2] |
| ***Thyroiditis*** [1] | Progression to permanent hypothyroidism (especially if high titres of thyroid autoantibodies); rarely, thyroid storm in severe thyrotoxic phase |

---

### 2. Complications of Treatment

#### 2.1 Complications of Conservative Treatment

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Prolonged cervical collar use** | ***Pressure sores, weakening of muscles, soft tissue contractures, decreased pulmonary function, chronic pain syndrome*** [2] | Immobility → disuse atrophy of paraspinal muscles → loss of dynamic stabilisation → paradoxically worsens pain; skin compression → pressure necrosis |
| **NSAIDs (long-term)** | Peptic ulceration, GI bleeding; renal impairment; cardiovascular events (↑ MI/stroke risk) | COX-1 inhibition → ↓ mucosal prostaglandin protection → ulceration; ↓ renal prostaglandins → afferent arteriolar constriction → ↓ GFR; COX-2 inhibition → ↑ thromboxane:prostacyclin ratio → prothrombotic |
| **Opioids** | Dependence, tolerance, constipation, respiratory depression, opioid-induced hyperalgesia | μ-receptor downregulation → tolerance; chronic use paradoxically sensitises pain pathways (central sensitisation) |
| **Cervical manipulation** | Vertebral artery dissection → posterior circulation stroke | Rotation and extension → mechanical stress on vertebral artery intima → dissection; rare (~1 per 1-5 million manipulations) but devastating |
| **Epidural steroid injection** | Spinal cord injury, epidural haematoma, infection, dural puncture headache | Direct needle trauma to cord (cervical > lumbar risk); haematoma from vessel injury; infection introduction |

<Callout title="Cervical Manipulation and Vertebral Artery Dissection" type="error">
While the absolute risk is small, cervical manipulation (chiropractic or physiotherapy high-velocity thrust techniques) carries a well-documented risk of vertebral artery dissection. This is because the vertebral artery is tethered as it enters the transverse foramen of C1 — forceful rotation at this segment can shear the intima. Warn patients of this risk before any manipulative therapy, and **NEVER** manipulate the cervical spine if there are signs of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (dizziness, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, drop attacks on neck rotation — the "5 D's").
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Complications of Cervical Spine Surgery

Cervical spine surgery carries specific risks related to the critical anatomy of the neck. These complications apply across all surgical approaches but some are approach-specific.

##### 2.2.1 General Surgical Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Wound infection** | Bacterial contamination of surgical site; risk factors: DM, immunosuppression, prolonged surgery | Prophylactic antibiotics; wound care; drainage and antibiotics if infected |
| **DVT / PE** | Immobility post-operatively + surgical tissue factor release → hypercoagulable state | Mechanical prophylaxis (TED stockings, pneumatic compression); pharmacological prophylaxis (LMWH) |
| **Anaesthetic complications** | Aspiration, atelectasis, pneumonia; ***intubation risk in patients with cervical instability*** [14] | Fibreoptic intubation for patients with known instability (RA, fracture); chest physiotherapy post-op |

##### 2.2.2 Anterior Approach Complications (ACDF, Corpectomy)

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence | Key Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dysphagia** | Retraction of oesophagus and pharynx during anterior exposure → oedema, neuropraxia of pharyngeal plexus | Very common (up to 50% transient; < 5% persistent) | Usually resolves within weeks; severe cases may need speech therapy assessment |
| ***Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury*** | The RLN (branch of vagus) runs in the tracheo-oesophageal groove; vulnerable to retraction, stretching, or transection during anterior approach | 1-11% (mostly transient) | ***Unilateral: hoarseness and ineffective cough; bilateral: stridor and dyspnoea (airway obstruction)*** [3]; intraoperative nerve monitoring can reduce risk |
| **Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) injury** | External branch of SLN runs close to the superior thyroid artery → injury during dissection | Underrecognised | ***Loss of high pitch, poor volume, easy fatigue*** [14]; important to ask if patient is a professional singer pre-operatively |
| **Oesophageal perforation** | Direct injury during retraction or from protruding hardware | Rare (< 0.5%) | Can lead to mediastinitis (life-threatening); requires immediate repair |
| **Vertebral artery injury** | Lateral dissection too far from midline → direct injury to vertebral artery | Rare | Potentially fatal haemorrhage; may require endovascular treatment |
| **Graft/cage extrusion or subsidence** | Graft dislodgement or settling of intervertebral cage into softened endplates | 2-5% | May require revision surgery; more common in osteoporotic bone |
| **Adjacent segment disease (ASD)** | Fusion eliminates motion at the operated level → compensatory hypermobility at adjacent segments → accelerated degeneration | 10-25% over 10 years | This is the major long-term limitation of fusion surgery; disc arthroplasty (motion-preserving) was developed specifically to address this problem |
| **Pseudarthrosis (non-union)** | Failure of bony fusion across the graft → persistent micromotion → pain | 5-10% | More common in smokers (nicotine impairs osteoblast function), multilevel fusion; may require revision |
| ***Haematoma*** | Post-operative bleeding into the surgical site → compresses trachea/oesophagus → ***acute laryngeal oedema → risk of airway compromise*** | 1-2% | ***Management: cut subcuticular stitches and stitches holding strap muscles (evacuate all blood) → intubation*** [5][14]; this is a surgical emergency |

> **Why is a post-operative neck haematoma so dangerous?** The neck is an enclosed space. A haematoma in the paratracheal region compresses the internal jugular veins → ↑ venous pressure → laryngeal oedema → airway compromise. The venous obstruction is actually more dangerous than the mass effect of the haematoma itself. This is why the emergency protocol is to **open all wound layers at the bedside** to decompress the neck, even before calling the surgeon.

##### 2.2.3 Posterior Approach Complications (Laminectomy, Laminoplasty, Fusion)

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **Post-laminectomy kyphosis** | Removal of laminae eliminates the posterior tension band → loss of extension moment → progressive cervical kyphosis → can re-create anterior cord compression | Most common after laminectomy without fusion; laminoplasty preserves posterior elements and reduces this risk |
| **C5 palsy** | Tethering and posterior drift of the cord after decompression → stretching of the short C5 nerve root (shortest cervical root) → neuropraxia | 5-12%; presents 1-7 days post-op with deltoid weakness; usually recovers over weeks to months |
| **Wound infection (deep)** | Posterior approach has higher wound infection rates than anterior (more tissue dissection, proximity to hair-bearing skin) | May require washout, debridement, long-term antibiotics |
| **Epidural haematoma** | Bleeding from epidural veins into the spinal canal → cord compression | Rare but requires emergency surgical evacuation |
| **Axial pain ("neck-ache")** | Extensive paraspinal muscle dissection → denervation and fibrosis of posterior cervical muscles | Common after open posterior approaches; minimally invasive techniques aim to reduce this |
| **Screw malposition** | Lateral mass or pedicle screws may breach the cortex → vertebral artery injury (lateral) or cord injury (medial) | Intraoperative fluoroscopy or navigation reduces risk |
| **Adjacent segment disease** | Same mechanism as anterior fusion (see above) | Laminoplasty (motion-preserving) has lower ASD rates than laminectomy + fusion |

##### 2.2.4 Complications Specific to Thyroid/Anterior Neck Surgery (Cross-Reference)

Since anterior neck surgery for other conditions (thyroidectomy, carotid endarterectomy) shares the same anatomical territory, these complications are relevant and frequently tested:

***Complications of thyroidectomy*** [5][14]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Immediate*** | ***Haematoma → airway compromise*** | As above; ***management: remove all stitches from skin down to cervical fascia at bedside (first action!)*** [14] |
| | ***RLN injury*** | ***Unilateral: hoarseness; bilateral: airway obstruction (6 adductors > 2 abductors)*** [14] |
| | ***SLN injury*** | Loss of high pitch, vocal fatigue |
| ***Early*** | ***Hypoparathyroidism → hypocalcaemia*** | Inadvertent removal or devascularisation of parathyroid glands → ↓ PTH → ↓ Ca²⁺; ***most common complication*** [3]; ***symptoms: perioral numbness, carpopedal spasm, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign; severe hypoCa can lead to laryngospasm*** [14] |
| | ***Hungry bone syndrome*** | Pre-op hyperthyroidism → high bone turnover; sudden ↓ PTH post-op → ↑↑↑ bone ossification → sudden severe hypocalcaemia [3][5] |
| ***Late*** | Hypothyroidism | Expected after total thyroidectomy → lifelong T4 replacement |
| | Keloid/hypertrophic scar | Abnormal wound healing |

---

### 3. Complications of Chronic Neck Pain Itself

Regardless of the underlying cause, chronic neck pain (> 12 weeks) is itself a disease state with its own complications:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Chronic disability and reduced function** | Pain avoidance → deconditioning → further pain → vicious cycle |
| **Depression and anxiety** | Chronic pain → ↓ serotonin and noradrenaline in descending inhibitory pathways → both worsens pain perception AND causes mood disorder; bidirectional relationship |
| **Sleep disturbance** | Pain → difficulty falling/staying asleep → poor restorative sleep → ↑ pain sensitivity (sleep deprivation reduces pain thresholds) |
| **Medication overuse** | Chronic analgesic consumption → tolerance → dose escalation → dependence (opioids); medication overuse headache (analgesics) |
| **Occupational impact** | Inability to work → financial stress → worsened psychosocial state → chronicity |
| **Social isolation** | Withdrawal from activities and relationships → depression → further pain amplification |
| ***Cervicogenic headache*** | Referred pain from C1-C3 facet joints or upper cervical roots via the trigeminocervical nucleus → chronic headache [2] |

---

### 4. Summary Table — Complications by Condition

| Condition | Key Complications |
|---|---|
| ***Cervical spondylosis*** [1] | Radiculopathy → motor deficit, chronic neuropathic pain; myelopathy → quadriparesis, sphincter dysfunction, irreversible cord damage |
| ***Whiplash*** [1] | Chronic WAD (20-40%), cervicogenic headache, vertebral artery dissection (rare), delayed disc herniation |
| ***Disc prolapse*** [1] | Radiculopathy progression; central prolapse → myelopathy |
| ***Myelopathy*** [1] | Irreversible quadriparesis, neurogenic bladder/bowel, respiratory compromise (high lesion), autonomic dysreflexia |
| ***RA cervical instability*** [1] | Cord compression, basilar invagination, sudden death from intubation/trauma |
| ***Arterial dissection*** [1] | Ischaemic stroke, Horner's syndrome, pseudoaneurysm |
| ***Vertebral fracture*** [1] | Cord injury (complete/incomplete), neurogenic shock, DVT/PE, pressure sores, chronic pain |
| ***Spinal infection*** [1] | Epidural abscess → cord compression; sepsis; vertebral collapse; kyphotic deformity |
| ***Cervical spine surgery*** | Anterior: dysphagia, RLN injury, oesophageal perforation, haematoma, ASD; Posterior: C5 palsy, post-laminectomy kyphosis, wound infection |
| ***Chronic neck pain*** | Depression, disability, medication overuse, sleep disturbance, cervicogenic headache |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Most important complications to know for exams:**

1. ***Cervical myelopathy is the most feared complication of spondylosis*** — irreversible cord damage if not surgically decompressed in time
2. ***Post-operative haematoma after anterior cervical/thyroid surgery*** → acute airway compromise → ***first action: open all wound layers at the bedside*** [5][14]
3. ***RLN injury***: unilateral → hoarseness; ***bilateral → airway obstruction*** (because 6 adductors overpower 2 abductors when partially irritated) [14]
4. ***Hypocalcaemia*** is the ***most common complication of total thyroidectomy*** → perioral numbness, carpopedal spasm, Chvostek/Trousseau signs → severe cases → ***laryngospasm*** [3][14]
5. ***RA + cervical instability + intubation = risk of sudden death*** — always screen before anaesthesia [8]
6. ***Adjacent segment disease*** is the long-term price of cervical fusion (10-25% over 10 years)
7. ***Methylprednisolone should NOT be used in traumatic spinal cord injury*** [2]
8. ***Vertebral artery dissection*** is a rare but catastrophic complication of cervical manipulation
9. ***Complete spinal cord injury: recovery rare; loss of sphincter function is a poor prognostic factor*** [2]
10. **Chronic neck pain complications** are biopsychosocial: depression, disability, medication overuse, occupational impact

Immediate action: open all wound layers at the bedside (cut subcuticular stitches and stitches holding strap muscles to evacuate blood and decompress the neck). Then: protect airway (call for senior help, prepare for intubation), supplemental oxygen, arrange emergency return to theatre for haemostasis.",

      question: "What is adjacent segment disease and why does it occur after cervical spinal fusion?",
      markscheme: "Adjacent segment disease is accelerated degeneration of the disc and facet joints at levels immediately above and below a fused segment. It occurs because fusion eliminates motion at the operated level, transferring compensatory hypermobility and mechanical stress to the adjacent unfused segments. This affects 10-25% of patients over 10 years and is the major long-term limitation of fusion surgery. Motion-preserving procedures like disc arthroplasty and laminoplasty were developed to reduce this risk.",

      markscheme: "RA causes transverse ligament destruction leading to atlantoaxial subluxation. Neck hyperextension during laryngoscopic intubation can cause acute atlantoaxial dislocation with cervicomedullary cord compression, potentially causing quadriplegia or sudden death. Screening requires lateral C-spine XR with flexion/extension views. AADI of 4 mm or more indicates instability. Fibreoptic intubation or video laryngoscopy with inline stabilisation should be used.",

      question: "What is the mechanism of central cord syndrome following a hyperextension injury in a patient with cervical spondylosis?",
      markscheme: "Pre-existing cervical stenosis (from spondylosis) reduces the space available for the cord. Hyperextension causes infolding of the ligamentum flavum and posterior osteophytes, which pinch the cord from behind while the anterior disc/osteophyte complex compresses from the front. The central cord (carrying cervical motor fibres for the upper limbs in the central part of the lateral corticospinal tract) is disproportionately compressed, causing greater upper limb weakness than lower limb weakness, with variable sensory loss and bladder dysfunction.",
