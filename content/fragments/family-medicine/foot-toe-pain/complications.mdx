## Complications of Foot/Toe Pain Conditions

Complications are best understood not as random events but as the **natural consequences of the underlying pathophysiology when it progresses unchecked or when treatments themselves cause harm**. I will systematically cover complications arising from the major conditions that cause foot/toe pain, and then complications of the treatments themselves (surgical, pharmacological, interventional). For each complication I will explain *why* it occurs — the mechanism.

### 1. Complications of Peripheral Arterial Disease and Limb Ischaemia

#### 1.1 Complications of the Disease Itself

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| ***Progression from claudication to critical limb ischaemia*** | Progressive atherosclerotic narrowing → collaterals eventually become insufficient even for resting metabolic demand → rest pain → tissue necrosis. ***At 5 years: stable claudication 70–80%, worsening 10–20%, critical CLI 1–2%*** [5] | Non-critical ischaemia is not primarily a limb problem — it is a ***CVS risk marker***. The bigger killer is MI and stroke: ***non-fatal MI/stroke 20%, death 15–30% at 5 years*** [5] |
| ***Gangrene*** (dry and wet) | ***Dry gangrene***: gradual arterial occlusion → coagulative necrosis of tissue without infection → ***hard, dry, shrunken, clear line of demarcation***. ***Wet gangrene***: superimposed bacterial infection on ischaemic tissue → liquefactive necrosis → ***soft, moist, swollen, no clear demarcation, surgical emergency*** [6] | Dry gangrene can be observed; wet gangrene demands emergency debridement/amputation because the infection can spread systemically (sepsis) and proximally |
| ***Ulceration*** | Chronic ischaemia → skin cannot repair even minor trauma → breakdown at pressure areas (heel, MT heads, between toes, tip of toes [5]). Unlike venous ulcers (medial malleolus), arterial ulcers are ***distal, well-defined, "punched out," painful, with a pale or necrotic base*** | The inability to heal drives chronic pain and infection risk |
| ***Cardiovascular events (MI, stroke)*** | PAD is a ***CHD risk equivalent*** (ATP-III) [5]. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease — if it affects the leg arteries, the coronary and cerebral arteries are almost certainly affected too | ***Critical CLI at 1 year: alive with two limbs 50%, amputation 25%, CVS mortality 25%*** [5]. This is the single most important prognostic point |

#### 1.2 Complications of Ischaemia Itself [5][6][7]

##### A. ***Compartment Syndrome*** [5][6][7]

This deserves a deep dive because it is a **must-not-miss** surgical emergency, commonly tested.

***Mechanism***: ***Prolonged ischaemia (≥ 6 hours) + delayed revascularisation → fluid leaks out via damaged cell membranes → oedema within the non-distensible fascial compartment → intracompartmental pressure rises → secondary ischaemia when pressure ≥ 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP*** [5].

This creates a **vicious cycle**: ischaemia → cell damage → swelling → more ischaemia → more swelling.

***Site***: ***commonly calf, especially the anterior tibial compartment*** [5]. ***Involvement of the posterior compartment is the most functionally devastating*** because it contains the tibial nerve and the deep flexors — damage leads to permanent foot deformity and sensory loss [6].

***Clinical features*** [5][6][7]:
- ***Pain out of proportion to the clinical situation*** (***earliest symptom*** [5])
- ***Pain with passive stretch*** (***most sensitive sign*** [5]) — passively dorsiflexing the toes stretches the muscles within the compartment → excruciating pain
- ***Numbness in the distribution of nerves running within the compartment*** — ***numbness in the web space between first and second toes suggests compression of the deep peroneal nerve in the anterior compartment*** [6]
- ***Tense compartment*** on palpation
- ***Pulses can be present*** because ***SBP >> intracompartmental pressure*** — a palpable pulse does NOT rule out compartment syndrome [7]

***Management***: ***Emergent fasciotomy → lay open for oedema to resolve, then close after a few days*** [5]. ***Consider prophylactic fasciotomy in OT if drastic ischaemia*** [5]. ***Check compartment pressure ( < 20 mmHg of diastolic BP) if in doubt*** [5].

<Callout title="Classic Exam Trap" type="error">
The presence of **peripheral pulses does NOT exclude compartment syndrome**. Compartment syndrome is a **microvascular** phenomenon — the pressure required to occlude the large arteries (systolic BP) is far higher than the pressure causing capillary collapse and tissue ischaemia (≥ 30 mmHg). By the time pulses are lost, irreversible damage has long since occurred. Always diagnose by ***clinical signs (pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch)*** and ***compartment pressure measurement*** if in doubt [5][7].
</Callout>

##### B. ***Rhabdomyolysis*** [5][6][7]

***Mechanism***: ***Reperfusion → release of K⁺, lactic acid, myoglobin, and CK from damaged muscle cells into the systemic circulation*** [5][6].

| Consequence | Why |
|------------|-----|
| ***Hyperkalaemia → cardiac arrhythmia*** | K⁺ released from lysed myocytes; can cause fatal ventricular fibrillation. ECG changes: peaked T waves → widened QRS → sine wave → VF |
| ***Myoglobin → acute kidney injury (AKI)*** | Myoglobin is freely filtered by the glomerulus; in acidic urine, it precipitates as casts in the renal tubules → ***acute tubular necrosis (ATN)*** [6]. Also, myoglobin generates free radicals that are directly nephrotoxic |
| ***Lactic acidosis*** | Anaerobic metabolism during ischaemia produces lactate; reperfusion washes this into the systemic circulation |
| ***ARDS*** | Systemic inflammatory response from reperfusion injury → lung capillary leak [5] |

***Risk factors***: ***poor background renal function*** [5]

***Management*** [5][6][7]:
- ***Aggressive hydration*** (target UO > 200–300 mL/hour) — dilutes myoglobin in the tubules, maintains renal perfusion
- ***IV bicarbonate*** — ***↓ acidosis, ↓ myoglobin cast formation*** (alkalinising the urine prevents myoglobin precipitation in tubules) [5]
- ***Mannitol diuresis*** — osmotic diuretic forces high urine flow, flushing myoglobin from tubules [7]
- ***Dialysis*** if refractory AKI or hyperkalaemia [5]
- ***Post-op monitoring***: ***BP/pulse, urine output, APTT, RFT, cardiac monitor*** [7]

##### C. ***Reperfusion Injury*** [6]

***Mechanism***: ***Formation of oxygen-free radicals upon re-introduction of oxygenated blood to ischaemic tissue → direct oxidative tissue damage + WBC accumulation and sequestration in microcirculation → paradoxically prolongs the ischaemic interval because impaired nutrient flow persists despite restoration of axial blood flow*** [6].

This is why revascularisation, while life-saving, is not without harm — it can actually worsen tissue damage in the short term.

### 2. Complications of Diabetic Foot Disease

This is the **most devastating complication of diabetes** affecting the foot and the leading cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputation worldwide [4].

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Foot ulcers*** | ***25% lifetime risk, annual risk 2%/year*** [4]. RFs: ***previous foot ulceration (most important), neuropathy (80%), foot deformity, concomitant vascular disease*** [4]. Neuropathy → loss of protective sensation → unrecognised repetitive trauma → skin breakdown at pressure points (MT heads, heel, toes). Motor neuropathy → intrinsic muscle wasting → claw toes → altered biomechanics → abnormal pressure distribution. Autonomic neuropathy → dry skin (loss of sweating) → cracking → portal of entry for infection |
| ***Diabetic foot infections (cellulitis, osteomyelitis)*** | Ulcer provides a portal of entry; ***hyperglycaemia impairs neutrophil function*** (chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative burst are all blunted) → poor immune defence → polymicrobial infection. ***Osteomyelitis*** occurs when infection spreads from soft tissue to bone through a deep ulcer (probe-to-bone test positive) |
| ***Charcot arthropathy*** | ***Lack of proprioception → ligament laxity → joint instability + deformity → prone to damage by minor trauma → vasomotor changes due to autonomic neuropathy lead to exaggerated local inflammatory response → progressive bony destruction*** [4]. Complications of Charcot: ***stress fractures, subluxation/dislocations*** [4], collapse of midfoot arch (rocker-bottom deformity), pressure ulcerations over bony prominences |
| ***Amputation*** | The final common pathway when ischaemia + infection + neuropathy combine. ***BKA (most common type): 90% will walk again; AKA: 50% will walk again*** [6]. Unilateral BKA increases energy expenditure by 40%; bilateral BKA by 60–70% [6] |
| ***Autonomic complications*** | ***Cardiovascular: resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, exercise intolerance***; ***sudomotor: distal hypohidrosis → dry cracking skin (further ulceration risk)***; ***GI: gastroparesis***; ***genitourinary: bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction*** [4] |

> **The diabetic foot cascade**: Neuropathy → deformity + loss of sensation → unrecognised trauma → ulcer → infection → osteomyelitis → amputation. ***Every step in this cascade is potentially preventable*** with proper screening (annual foot examination with monofilament testing), education, footwear, and glycaemic control [4].

### 3. Complications of Gout [3]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Chronic tophaceous gout*** | Persistent hyperuricaemia → continued MSU crystal deposition → ***gouty tophi*** (collections of solid MSU crystals with surrounding inflammation and soft tissue destruction) at ***extensor surfaces, fingers, elbows, Achilles tendons, helix of ear*** [3]. Complications of tophi: ***ulceration with discharging whitish gritty material, infection, inflammation (erythema and pus discharge without infection → may mimic dactylitis)*** [3] |
| ***Progressive joint destruction*** | Chronic crystal-induced inflammation → pannus-like tissue → erosion of cartilage and bone. ***XR: "rat-bite" erosions with overhanging edges*** |
| ***Renal manifestations*** | ***Urate stones*** (uric acid nephrolithiasis — uric acid is poorly soluble in acidic urine → stones form in concentrated, acidic urine); ***uric acid nephropathy*** (crystal deposition in renal interstitium → chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis) [3] |
| ***Increasing flare frequency*** | ***In untreated patients, 2nd flare occurs ≤ 1 year (62%), ≤ 2 years (78%), ≤ 10 years (93%)*** [3]. ***Flares become progressively shorter intercritical period, increasingly prolonged, disabling, polyarticular and may be associated with fever*** [3] |
| ***Secondary infection of tophi*** | Tophi that ulcerate through the skin create a portal of entry for bacteria → secondary septic arthritis on a background of crystal arthropathy — a dangerous combination that can be difficult to diagnose (since the joint is already inflamed) |

---

### 4. Complications of Hallux Valgus [8]

**Disease complications** (from the deformity itself):
- ***Transfer metatarsalgia*** (2nd and 3rd MTPJ overload) — as the 1st ray becomes insufficient due to the deformity, load transfers to the lesser MTPJs → pain under 2nd/3rd MT heads [8]
- ***Bunionette*** (5th MTPJ) — widening of the forefoot leads to prominence of the 5th MT head → friction and pain
- ***OA of the 1st MTPJ*** — malalignment accelerates cartilage wear
- ***Plantar callosities*** — altered biomechanics → abnormal pressure distribution → skin thickening

***Surgical complications*** [8]:
- ***Avascular necrosis*** — osteotomy disrupts blood supply to the metatarsal head (especially distal osteotomies like Chevron)
- ***Non-union*** — failure of the osteotomy to heal (risk factors: smoking, inadequate fixation)
- ***Displacement*** — loss of fixation → recurrence of deformity
- ***Reduced ROM*** — excessive scar tissue or overtightening of the capsule → stiffness

---

### 5. Complications of Pes Planus (Flat Foot) [8]

- ***Tenosynovitis of calcaneonavicular ligament (spring ligament)*** — the collapsed arch places excessive strain on this ligament → ***permanent elongation → rupture → worsening arch collapse → secondary arthritis*** (a vicious cycle) [8]
- Progressive hindfoot valgus → lateral ankle impingement
- Secondary metatarsalgia from altered biomechanics
- If from tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction: tendon eventually ruptures → ***rigid flat foot deformity*** that is no longer correctable conservatively

---

### 6. Complications of Achilles Tendon Pathology

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Chronic tendinosis** → **complete rupture** | Untreated tendinopathy → progressive degeneration → threshold for rupture is lowered → rupture can occur with minimal force. ***Active ankle plantarflexion still possible*** after rupture (tibialis posterior, peroneus longus and brevis compensate), which is why rupture can be ***missed*** if only active ROM is tested without the Thompson test [8] |
| **Missed rupture** | If not diagnosed acutely → tendon ends retract → gap fills with scar tissue → chronic weakness, inability to push off, altered gait → compensatory overload of other structures (plantar fasciitis, knee pain). Late surgical repair is more complex and outcomes are inferior |
| **Post-surgical complications** | Wound healing problems (the skin over the Achilles has poor vascularity), sural nerve injury, re-rupture (~2–5% after surgical repair), deep vein thrombosis (from immobilisation) |

---

### 7. Complications of Ankle Sprains / Fractures

| Complication | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Chronic ankle instability** | Repeated lateral ankle sprains → attenuated ATFL/CFL → mechanical instability + functional instability (proprioceptive deficit). Leads to recurrent sprains, OA of the ankle joint |
| **Osteochondral lesion of the talus** | Medial ankle joint pain after inversion injury → interruption of cartilage + underlying bone at the medial talar dome. Can cause chronic pain, catching, effusion. Diagnosed by MRI; may require arthroscopic debridement + microfracture |
| **Post-traumatic OA** | Ankle fracture (especially involving the articular surface) → incongruent joint → accelerated cartilage wear → OA. Risk is highest with malreduced fractures or missed Lisfranc injuries |
| **Nerve injury after surgery** | ***Saphenous nerve (at mid-thigh and mid-leg)***: sensory to medial leg and medial foot. ***Sural nerve (at lateral leg)***: sensory to posterior leg and lateral foot [7] |
| **Syndesmotic injury** (high ankle sprain) | Disruption of the tibiofibular syndesmosis → widening of the mortise → ankle instability → requires fixation (syndesmotic screw or tightrope) |

---

### 8. Complications of Amputation [6]

***Indications for amputation (mnemonic: 3D)*** [7]:
- ***Dead***: ischaemia and unsalvageable
- ***Damage***: trauma / burns
- ***Danger***: gangrene / necrotising fasciitis / osteomyelitis / ascending sepsis / malignancy

***Principles*** [6]:
- Remove all infected tissues
- Ensure adequacy of blood supply to heal the amputation
- ***Preserve as much length of extremity as possible*** — improves rehabilitation opportunity

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| ***Early*** | ***Bleeding and haematoma formation*** | Surgical vascular injury; coagulopathy |
| | ***Wound infection*** | Contamination; poor perfusion of stump (especially in vascular disease) |
| | ***Phantom limb pain*** | Reorganisation of somatosensory cortex — the cortical representation of the amputated limb persists and generates spontaneous pain signals. Also, neuroma formation at the severed nerve endings sends abnormal afferent signals. Affects up to 80% of amputees. Treatment: gabapentinoids, mirror therapy, TENS |
| | ***Skin necrosis*** | ***Secondary to poor perfusion of stump*** [6] — if the amputation level was too distal for the available blood supply |
| ***Late*** | ***Stump ulceration*** | Pressure on poorly vascularised/poorly padded stump |
| | ***Stump neuroma*** | Cut nerve endings attempt to regenerate → form a disorganised ball of axonal sprouts (neuroma) → exquisitely tender on pressure |
| | ***Osteomyelitis*** | Infection reaching the exposed bone end, especially if wound healing was compromised |
| | ***Osteophyte formation in underlying bone*** | Periosteal reaction at the bone end → bony spurs that can cause socket discomfort |
| | ***Fixed flexion deformity*** | Prolonged immobilisation/improper positioning → contracture (especially hip flexion in AKA, knee flexion in BKA) → impairs prosthetic fitting |
| | ***Difficult mobilisation*** | Deconditioning, energy expenditure increase (40% BKA unilateral, 60–70% bilateral BKA, 100% AKA unilateral) [6], psychological factors, prosthetic issues |

<Callout title="Phantom Limb Pain — Why Does It Happen?">
After amputation, the brain's somatosensory cortex still has the "map" of the lost limb. Neurons that previously received input from the amputated foot now receive input from adjacent cortical regions (cortical remapping — Ramachandran). This mismatch generates pain in a limb that no longer exists. Additionally, the severed peripheral nerve endings form **neuromas** that fire spontaneously, sending nociceptive signals to the brain that are interpreted as originating from the absent limb. **Mirror therapy** (where the patient watches the reflection of their intact limb being moved, creating the visual illusion that the amputated limb is moving normally) can "retrain" the cortex and reduce phantom pain.
</Callout>

### 9. Complications of Specific Treatments

#### 9.1 Endovascular Interventions (PTA / Stenting) [7]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Arterial dissection / rupture*** | Balloon inflation or guidewire manipulation can tear the intima or even the full vessel wall |
| ***Distal embolisation*** | Balloon inflation can dislodge atherosclerotic debris → travels distally → occludes smaller arteries → "trash foot" / blue toe syndrome |
| ***Re-stenosis*** | Neointimal hyperplasia — smooth muscle cells proliferate in response to endothelial injury from the balloon/stent → progressive re-narrowing (typically 6–12 months). Drug-eluting stents reduce this |
| ***Contrast nephropathy*** | Iodinated contrast is directly toxic to renal tubular cells and causes renal vasoconstriction → AKI. Risk: pre-existing CKD, dehydration, diabetes |
| ***Access site complications*** | Haematoma, pseudoaneurysm, AV fistula at the femoral puncture site |

#### 9.2 Thrombolysis (for acute ischaemia) [6][7]

- ***Stroke and haemorrhage***: ***patients treated with endovascular procedures (thrombolysis) are associated with a higher risk of stroke and major haemorrhage including GI bleeding and haematoma at vascular puncture site*** [6]
- ***Contraindications: previous stroke/TIA, recent GI bleed, bleeding tendency, pregnancy*** [7]

#### 9.3 Corticosteroid Injections (for plantar fasciitis, gout, CPPD)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Plantar fascia rupture** | Corticosteroids inhibit collagen synthesis → weakens the fascia → risk of rupture, especially with repeated injections |
| **Fat pad atrophy** | Steroid diffuses into the calcaneal fat pad → adipocyte atrophy → loss of shock absorption → chronic heel pain |
| **Infection** | Any injection carries a small risk of introducing bacteria; must use strict aseptic technique and rule out septic arthritis before injecting |
| **Skin depigmentation / subcutaneous atrophy** | Local steroid effect on melanocytes and subcutaneous tissue |

#### 9.4 Allopurinol — Hypersensitivity Syndrome [3]

- ***Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS)***: severe drug reaction manifesting as SJS/TEN, DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), acute hepatitis, interstitial nephritis
- ***Strongly associated with HLA-B*5801*** — prevalence ~6–8% in HK Chinese
- Mortality rate of AHS: 20–25%
- Prevention: ***HLA-B*5801 screening mandatory before starting allopurinol in at-risk populations***; start low, go slow (100 mg/day, titrate gradually)

#### 9.5 NSAIDs (used widely across foot/toe pain conditions) [1]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **GI ulceration/bleeding** | COX-1 inhibition → ↓ protective prostaglandins in gastric mucosa → mucosal injury. Risk: elderly, concurrent anticoagulation, H. pylori, previous GI bleed |
| **Renal impairment** | COX inhibition → ↓ prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar vasodilation → ↓ GFR. Risk: CKD, dehydration, heart failure, concurrent ACEi/ARB |
| **Cardiovascular events** | COX-2 selective inhibition → imbalance between thromboxane A₂ (pro-thrombotic) and prostacyclin (anti-thrombotic) → ↑ thrombotic risk |
| **Hypertension** | Sodium and water retention from renal prostaglandin inhibition |

#### 9.6 Fluoroquinolone-Associated Achilles Tendon Damage [1]

- ***Fluoroquinolones*** (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) can cause ***Achilles tendinopathy and rupture*** [1]
- Mechanism: fluoroquinolones directly impair tenocyte proliferation and collagen synthesis; also ↑ matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity → tendon degradation
- Risk factors: age > 60, concurrent corticosteroids, CKD, prior tendon disorders
- This is an important ***drug-related masquerade*** for foot/toe pain — always check the drug history [1]

---

### 10. Complications of Peripheral Neuropathy [12]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Trophic changes*** | Denervation of skin → ***disuse atrophy, hair loss, brittle nails, trophic ulcers, Charcot joints*** [12] — the loss of trophic factors normally supplied by intact nerve fibres leads to tissue degeneration |
| ***Skeletal deformity*** | Motor neuropathy → muscle imbalance → ***claw toes, pes cavus, kyphoscoliosis*** [12] |
| ***Falls and injuries*** | Loss of proprioception + motor weakness → gait instability → falls → fractures |
| ***Neuropathic pain*** | Damaged nerve fibres fire spontaneously → chronic burning, shooting, electric-shock pain that is often ***refractory to conventional analgesics*** and requires gabapentinoids or amitriptyline [4] |

---

### 11. Complications of Rheumatoid Arthritis Affecting the Foot [3][10]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| ***Forefoot destruction*** | Symmetric MTPJ synovitis → pannus → erosion of cartilage and bone → ***hallux valgus, clawing/crowding of toes, subluxation of MT heads through plantar skin*** [3][10] → "walking on pebbles" |
| ***Flattening of arches*** | ***Flattening of transverse/longitudinal plantar arches may occur in arthritic conditions of foot (e.g., RA)*** [10] |
| ***Rheumatoid nodules on Achilles tendon*** | Subcutaneous nodules at pressure points → risk of Achilles rupture if the tendon is weakened |
| ***Secondary OA*** | Chronic joint damage → degenerative changes superimposed on inflammatory destruction |
| ***Vasculitic ulcers*** | RA-associated small vessel vasculitis → digital ischaemia → nail fold infarcts, digital ulcers |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of limb ischaemia:**
- Disease progression: claudication → critical limb ischaemia → gangrene (dry = observe; wet = emergency surgery). CVS events are the main killer (MI/stroke).
- Ischaemia complications: compartment syndrome (pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch, tense compartment — pulses may be present! → emergency fasciotomy) and rhabdomyolysis (K⁺ → arrhythmia; myoglobin → AKI → aggressive hydration + IV bicarbonate + mannitol ± dialysis).
- Reperfusion injury: oxygen free radicals → tissue damage + WBC sequestration in microcirculation.

**Diabetic foot cascade:** Neuropathy → deformity + loss of sensation → ulcer → infection → osteomyelitis → amputation. Every step is preventable.

**Gout complications:** Chronic tophaceous gout (tophi with ulceration/infection), progressive joint destruction, urate stones, uric acid nephropathy. Untreated: 62% second flare within 1 year.

**Amputation complications:** Early (bleeding, infection, phantom limb pain, skin necrosis); Late (stump ulceration, neuroma, osteomyelitis, fixed flexion deformity, difficult mobilisation). BKA: 90% walk again; AKA: 50%.

**Treatment complications:** PTA (dissection, distal embolisation, re-stenosis); thrombolysis (stroke, haemorrhage); corticosteroid injection (fascia rupture, fat pad atrophy); allopurinol (AHS with SJS/TEN — HLA-B*5801 screening mandatory in HK Chinese); NSAIDs (GI bleed, AKI, CVS events); fluoroquinolones (Achilles rupture).

Clinical features: pain out of proportion (earliest symptom), pain with passive stretch (most sensitive sign), numbness in nerve distribution (e.g., first web space for anterior compartment - deep peroneal nerve), tense compartment. Pulses present because systolic BP is much higher than intracompartmental pressure - large arteries are not occluded, but capillary perfusion is compromised. Treatment: emergency fasciotomy."

      question: "Why does rhabdomyolysis following limb revascularisation cause acute kidney injury, and how does IV bicarbonate help?",
      markscheme: "Mechanism of AKI: Damaged muscle cells release myoglobin into the circulation. Myoglobin is freely filtered by the glomerulus. In acidic urine, myoglobin precipitates as casts within the renal tubules causing tubular obstruction (cast nephropathy). Additionally, myoglobin generates reactive oxygen species that are directly toxic to tubular epithelial cells, causing acute tubular necrosis. IV bicarbonate helps by alkalinising the urine (raising urine pH above 6.5), which prevents myoglobin precipitation and cast formation in the tubules, and reduces the generation of myoglobin-derived free radicals."

      question: "Explain the mechanism of phantom limb pain after amputation and name two treatment approaches.",

Cortical remapping occurs where adjacent cortical regions invade the deafferented area, generating aberrant pain signals perceived as coming from the missing limb. (2) Peripheral: Severed nerve endings form neuromas that fire spontaneously, sending nociceptive afferent signals interpreted by the brain as originating from the absent limb. Treatment: (1) Gabapentinoids (gabapentin/pregabalin) to reduce neuronal excitability; (2) Mirror therapy - patient views reflection of intact limb being moved, creating visual illusion of normal amputated limb movement, retraining the cortex. Others: TENS, tricyclic antidepressants, nerve blocks."
