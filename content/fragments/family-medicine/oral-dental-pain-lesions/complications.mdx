## Complications of Oral/Dental Pain and Lesions

Complications arise when oral/dental conditions progress beyond the initial pathology — either because the disease itself is inherently aggressive (malignancy, deep space infection), because treatment carries iatrogenic risks (surgery, radiotherapy, immunosuppression), or because an apparently benign condition is not recognised or treated in time. This section covers complications organised by the category of the primary condition, with the pathophysiological "why" explained from first principles.

### 1. Complications of Dental Infections

The fundamental problem with dental infections is that bacteria reside in a confined, avascular space (the necrotic pulp chamber or periodontal pocket). Once infection breaches the periapical region, it enters the soft tissue planes of the head and neck — and the anatomy dictates where it spreads.

#### 1.1 Local Spread

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Periapical abscess** | Pulp necrosis → bacteria enter periapical tissue → walled-off abscess | Throbbing toothache, localised swelling over alveolus, tender to percussion, may develop draining sinus (fistula) on gingiva or skin |
| **Facial cellulitis** | Abscess breaches periosteum → spreads into overlying facial soft tissue | Diffuse facial swelling, erythema, warmth, tenderness; no fluctuance (cellulitis = not yet localised) |
| **Ludwig's angina** | Bilateral infection of sublingual + submandibular spaces (classically from lower molar infection breaching the lingual cortex of the mandible below the mylohyoid line) | Floor of mouth elevation, "woody" induration of submandibular region, drooling, dysphagia, stridor — **airway emergency**. Why bilateral? The sublingual spaces communicate freely across the midline |
| **Parapharyngeal / retropharyngeal abscess** | Spread along fascial planes from submandibular or peritonsillar space into the parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal space | Trismus, torticollis, "hot potato" voice, neck swelling, dysphagia. Retropharyngeal abscess may cause posterior pharyngeal wall bulging on lateral neck X-ray |
| **Mediastinitis** | Descending necrotising infection tracking along the deep cervical fascial planes into the superior mediastinum | Chest pain, sepsis, high mortality (40–50%). This is the most feared complication — the "danger space" (between alar and prevertebral fascia) extends continuously from the skull base to the posterior mediastinum at the level of the diaphragm |
| **Cavernous sinus thrombosis** | Infection from upper face (particularly nasolabial/"danger triangle of the face") or maxillary teeth spreads via valveless facial veins → ophthalmic veins → cavernous sinus | Headache, proptosis, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia (CN III/IV/VI within cavernous sinus), V1/V2 sensory loss, high fever, rapid deterioration. Bilateral involvement is classic |
| **Osteomyelitis of the mandible/maxilla** | Chronic or severe dental infection → spread to medullary bone | Persistent pain, swelling, fistula, sequestrum formation on imaging; more common in mandible (less vascular than maxilla) |

<Callout title="The 'Danger Triangle of the Face'" type="error">
The area bounded by the bridge of the nose and the corners of the mouth is drained by the anterior facial vein, which communicates via valveless veins with the pterygoid venous plexus and cavernous sinus. Squeezing a "pimple" or failing to treat an infection in this zone can lead to cavernous sinus thrombosis — a life-threatening intracranial complication. This is why mid-face infections demand aggressive antibiotic treatment.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Systemic Spread

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bacteraemia / Sepsis** | Dental infections (especially extraction, scaling, or spontaneous bacteraemia from periodontitis) allow oral bacteria (viridans streptococci, anaerobes) to enter the bloodstream → systemic inflammatory response → sepsis if uncontrolled |
| ***Infective endocarditis*** | ***Transient bacteraemia following dental procedures → bacteria adhere to damaged/prosthetic endocardium → vegetations*** [23]. This is precisely why IE prophylaxis exists for high-risk patients: ***prosthetic valve, previous IE, cyanotic CHD*** [23] |

#### 1.3 Complications of Chronic Periodontal Disease

- **Tooth loss** — progressive alveolar bone destruction → loosening → eventual loss of teeth. Periodontitis is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults
- **Systemic inflammatory burden** — chronic periodontitis is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, poorer glycaemic control in diabetes, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth). The proposed mechanism is chronic low-grade bacteraemia and systemic inflammation from the periodontal pocket
- **Aspiration pneumonia** — oral bacteria from periodontal disease can be aspirated into the lower respiratory tract, particularly in elderly, debilitated, or neurologically impaired patients

---

### 2. Complications of Oral Infections

#### 2.1 HSV Complications

***Complications of HSV*** [5]:
- ***Herpes keratitis: pain, blurring of vision*** [5] — HSV replicates in corneal epithelium → dendritic ulcer → if untreated, progresses to stromal keratitis → corneal scarring → one of the commonest causes for corneal transplant
- ***CNS involvement: meningitis (usually HSV-2), encephalitis (usually HSV-1)*** [5] — HSV-1 encephalitis has a predilection for the temporal lobes; carries high mortality if untreated (70%)
- ***Systemic involvement (if immunocompromised): oesophagitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, retinitis*** [5]
- ***Other manifestations: erythema multiforme, eczema herpeticum*** [5]
  - Erythema multiforme: HSV is the most common trigger (90% of EM cases) [11]; the immune response against HSV-infected keratinocytes causes collateral damage to normal skin
  - Eczema herpeticum: widespread HSV infection in patients with pre-existing atopic dermatitis — can be life-threatening

#### 2.2 GAS Pharyngitis Complications

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Peritonsillar abscess (quinsy)** | During or shortly after acute infection | Direct spread of infection through tonsillar capsule into peritonsillar space → abscess collection between capsule and pharyngeal constrictor muscle. Presents with severe unilateral throat pain, trismus, "hot potato" voice, uvular deviation |
| **Rheumatic fever** | 2–4 weeks after untreated GAS pharyngitis | Molecular mimicry: antibodies against GAS M protein cross-react with cardiac myosin, valvular glycoproteins, and neuronal tissue → immune-mediated inflammation of heart (carditis), joints (migratory polyarthritis), CNS (Sydenham's chorea), skin (erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules) |
| **Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis** | 1–3 weeks after pharyngitis or skin infection | Immune complex deposition in glomerular basement membrane → complement activation → glomerular inflammation |
| **Scarlet fever** | During acute GAS infection | Erythrogenic toxin (streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin) → diffuse erythematous "sandpaper" rash with circumoral pallor, "strawberry tongue", Pastia's lines |

#### 2.3 Peritonsillar Abscess Complications

- **Airway obstruction** — the abscess pushes the tonsil medially and inferiorly, narrowing the oropharyngeal airway
- **Aspiration** — spontaneous rupture of abscess → pus drains into the airway
- **Lemierre syndrome** — septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, classically caused by *Fusobacterium necrophorum*. Complicates pharyngeal infection → septic emboli to lungs (cavitating pneumonia), joints, liver. Presents as persistent fever + neck swelling/tenderness after pharyngitis ("postanginal sepsis")

---

### 3. Complications of Autoimmune / Vesiculobullous Oral Diseases

#### 3.1 Pemphigus Vulgaris

- ***Poor nutrition and weight loss*** — ***oral pain exacerbated by chewing or swallowing*** [7] → patients avoid eating → malnutrition, dehydration, muscle wasting
- **Secondary infection** — denuded mucosal and skin surfaces are a portal of entry for bacteria → cellulitis, sepsis. This is the most common cause of death in severe pemphigus
- **Complications of immunosuppressive treatment** — long-term systemic steroids cause osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, opportunistic infections, avascular necrosis. Rituximab carries risks of hepatitis B reactivation, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), hypogammaglobulinaemia. Azathioprine causes myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity
- **Oesophageal involvement** — pemphigus can extend to the oesophageal mucosa → painful dysphagia, oesophageal stricture

#### 3.2 Stevens-Johnson Syndrome / Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis

***SJS/TEN complications*** [10][21]:

**Acute complications**:
- ***Acute skin failure: dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, hypovolaemic shock, hypercatabolic state, multi-organ failure*** [21] — the denuded skin loses its barrier function (just like a burn), leading to massive transepidermal fluid loss
- ***Infections: 27% bacteremia; sepsis and septic shock as the main cause of death*** [21]
  - ***Most commonly S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae*** [21]
- ***Pulmonary: pneumonia, interstitial pneumonitis, acute respiratory failure (~25%)*** [21] — bronchial epithelial sloughing can cause airway obstruction and pseudomembrane formation
- ***GI: due to epithelial necrosis of oesophagus, small bowel, colon (uncommon)*** [21]

***Late ocular complications (60%)*** [10]:
- ***Symblepharon: adhesion of palpebral and bulbar conjunctivae*** — ***complicates conjunctival ulceration in acute phase; can lead to dry eye due to disruption of tear film dynamics*** [10]
- ***Conjunctival scarring: may cause chronic microtrauma to cornea*** [10]
- ***Ankyloblepharon: fusion of eyelid margins*** [10]
- ***Conjunctivalisation of cornea due to loss of limbal stem cells → conjunctiva grows over cornea*** [10]
- ***Corneal neovascularisation*** [10]

**Late mucosal sequelae**:
- ***Urogenital: vaginal adhesion, labial stenosis*** [21] (from scarring of genital erosions)
- Oral: mucosal scarring, sicca-like symptoms
- Oesophageal stricture (rare but disabling)

***Prognostication: SCORTEN scoring system*** [21]:
- ***Factors (1 point each): age > 40y, HR > 120, cancer/haematologic malignancy, BSA > 10%, serum urea > 10mmol/L, HCO₃⁻ > 20mmol/L, glucose > 14mmol/L*** [21]
- ***Mortality: 3.2% (0–1), 12.1% (2), 35.8% (3), 58.3% (4), 90% (5)*** [21]

<Callout title="SJS/TEN — Ocular Complications Are the Most Disabling Long-Term Sequelae" type="error">
Even after the skin has healed, ***60% of SJS/TEN patients have late ocular complications*** [10]. Symblepharon, corneal scarring, and limbal stem cell loss can cause progressive visual impairment and even blindness. This is why ***early ophthalmology involvement and amniotic membrane transplantation*** [10] in the acute phase are so critical — they reduce the severity of long-term scarring.
</Callout>

#### 3.3 Erythema Multiforme

***Complications are usually due to mucosal involvement*** [11]:
- ***Poor intake leading to fluid and electrolyte imbalance*** [11]
- ***Ocular involvement with keratitis, conjunctival scarring, visual impairment*** [11]
- Recurrent EM can significantly impact quality of life; some patients have > 6 episodes per year

#### 3.4 Behçet Disease

Complications reflect the systemic nature of this vasculitis [8]:
- ***Ocular (25–75%): bilateral panuveitis (± hypopyon), retinal vasculitis, optic neuritis*** [8] — recurrent uveitis can lead to **blindness** if inadequately treated. Behçet disease is one of the few conditions that causes hypopyon uveitis
- ***Vascular disease: VTE common and occurs early (53%)*** [8]; arterial aneurysms (especially pulmonary artery — risk of fatal haemoptysis)
- ***Neurological (< 10%)*** [8]: parenchymal CNS disease (meningoencephalitis) or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis
- ***Relapsing/remitting course, increased severity in young male Asians*** [8]

---

### 4. Complications of Premalignant Lesions

The primary complication is **malignant transformation** — this is why these lesions matter.

| Premalignant Lesion | Transformation Rate | Highest Risk Subtype/Location |
|---|---|---|
| ***Leukoplakia*** [1] | ~1–5% per year overall | ***Floor of mouth has highest risk*** [3]; ***speckled leukoplakia has the highest rate of malignant transformation*** [3] |
| ***Erythroplakia*** [3] | Up to 50% harbour invasive SCC or CIS at biopsy | Any location; the red colour IS the danger sign (thin dysplastic epithelium) |
| **Oral lichen planus** | ~1% over 5 years | Erosive/atrophic forms higher risk than reticular |
| **Oral submucous fibrosis** | 7–13% | Progressive fibrosis → trismus → limits surgical access if SCC develops |
| ***Plummer-Vinson syndrome*** [3] | ***Well-established relationship with the development of oral cancer*** [3] | Postcricoid region; oral cavity |

---

### 5. Complications of Oral Malignancy

Complications of oral SCC arise from the disease itself, its treatment, or both.

#### 5.1 Complications of the Disease

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **Local tissue destruction** | Tumour invades adjacent structures — bone, muscle, nerves, blood vessels | ***Trismus (pterygoid muscle involvement, may indicate skull base spread)*** [3]; ***tongue deviation/fasciculation/atrophy (hypoglossal nerve invasion)*** [3]; ***paraesthesia (lingual/mental nerve invasion)*** [3]; pathological fracture of mandible |
| **Regional lymph node metastasis** | Oral SCC spreads via lymphatics to cervical nodes | Present at diagnosis in a high proportion of oropharyngeal cancers [3]; enlarging neck mass; may compromise carotid artery (carotid blowout syndrome — catastrophic haemorrhage) |
| ***Distant metastasis*** | Haematogenous spread to lungs, liver, bone | Less common than regional spread for oral cavity SCC; more common for NPC — ***bone (75%), liver, lung, distant LN*** [4] |
| **Airway obstruction** | Large oropharyngeal or tongue base tumours obstruct the airway | May require emergency tracheostomy |
| **Malnutrition and cachexia** | Dysphagia + odynophagia → reduced oral intake; cancer-related cachexia (cytokine-mediated wasting) | Weight loss is a major negative prognostic factor in H&N cancer |
| **Aspiration pneumonia** | Impaired swallowing (tumour bulk, nerve involvement) → aspiration of food/secretions | Common cause of morbidity in advanced H&N cancer |

#### 5.2 Complications of Surgical Treatment

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention/Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Impaired articulation*** [3] | ***Resection of large tumours of tongue leading to decreased lingual contact with palate, lip and teeth*** [3] | ***Reconstruction using soft pliable fasciocutaneous free flaps for intraoral bulk and preservation of tongue mobility*** [3]; ***prosthetic augmentation*** [3]; speech therapy |
| ***Impaired swallowing*** [3] | Loss of tongue bulk and mobility; palatal defects; pharyngeal resection | ***Dental prosthesis for through-and-through palatal defects*** [3]; swallowing rehabilitation; may require gastrostomy for nutritional support |
| **Facial nerve injury** (parotid surgery) [24] | The facial nerve (CN VII) runs through the parotid gland, dividing it into superficial and deep lobes. Parotid surgery risks damage to any of its five branches | Intraoperative nerve monitoring; meticulous surgical technique; temporary weakness (neuropraxia) common, permanent damage uncommon with experienced surgeon |
| ***Frey syndrome*** [24] | ***Characterised by sweating and flushing of facial skin over parotid bed and neck during mastication*** [24]. ***Results from aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres between the otic ganglion and salivary tissues which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels*** [24] | Botulinum toxin injection; antiperspirant application; interposition of tissue flap (e.g., SCM muscle flap or dermis fat graft) between parotid bed and skin |
| **Shoulder dysfunction** (radical neck dissection) | ***Radical neck dissection removes the spinal accessory nerve (CN XI)*** [3] → denervation of trapezius → shoulder drop, winged scapula, inability to abduct shoulder above 90° | Modified radical neck dissection preserves CN XI when possible; physiotherapy post-op |
| **Flap failure** | Vascular compromise (thrombosis of anastomosed vessels) of free flap reconstruction | Close post-operative monitoring of flap (colour, temperature, capillary refill, Doppler); early return to theatre if compromise detected |
| **Orocutaneous fistula** | Breakdown of surgical wound → communication between oral cavity and skin | Wound care; may require secondary surgical closure; risk increased with prior radiation |

#### 5.3 Complications of Radiotherapy to the Head and Neck

Radiotherapy is a mainstay treatment for H&N cancer but carries significant acute and long-term side effects, many of which directly affect the oral cavity.

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Oral mucositis** | Acute (during RT, peaks week 3–5) | Radiation damages rapidly dividing mucosal epithelial cells → ulceration, inflammation | Severe pain, difficulty eating/drinking → malnutrition, dehydration; may require treatment breaks, opioid analgesia, NG/PEG feeding |
| **Radiation dermatitis** | Acute | Radiation damages skin epithelium and dermis | Erythema → dry desquamation → moist desquamation in severe cases |
| **Xerostomia** | Acute onset, often permanent | Radiation destroys salivary gland acinar cells (serous acini are exquisitely radiosensitive) → irreversible gland atrophy | Dry mouth → impaired taste → difficulty chewing/swallowing → dramatically increased dental caries risk → poor quality of life. This is one of the most distressing long-term sequelae |
| **Radiation caries** | Late (months–years) | Xerostomia → loss of salivary buffering, antimicrobial and remineralising functions → rampant dental decay, characteristically affecting the cervical (neck) region of teeth and incisal edges | Rapidly progressive, diffuse caries pattern unlike typical caries; requires aggressive preventive dentistry (fluoride trays, frequent dental review) |
| **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN)** | Late (months–years) | Radiation damages blood vessels in bone → hypovascular, hypocellular, hypoxic tissue → bone cannot heal after trauma (e.g., tooth extraction) → necrosis, secondary infection | Exposed necrotic mandible, pain, fistula, pathological fracture. **Prevention**: comprehensive dental assessment BEFORE RT → extract all teeth with poor prognosis before RT begins (and wait ≥ 2 weeks for healing before starting RT). **Why mandible > maxilla?** The mandible has a poorer blood supply (single inferior alveolar artery) compared to the maxilla (rich collateral supply from multiple branches of the maxillary artery) |
| **Trismus (radiation-induced fibrosis)** | Late | Fibrosis of masticatory muscles (masseter, medial/lateral pterygoids) and TMJ capsule | Progressive limitation of mouth opening; interferes with eating, dental care, oral hygiene. Prevention: jaw exercises during and after RT |
| **Dysphagia (radiation-related)** | Acute and late | Acute: mucositis → pain on swallowing. Late: fibrosis of pharyngeal constrictors → impaired peristalsis → chronic dysphagia | May require long-term gastrostomy; aspiration risk |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Late (months–years) | Radiation to neck includes the thyroid gland → thyroid follicular cell damage → insufficient hormone production | Screen with TSH every 6–12 months post-RT; treat with levothyroxine if hypothyroid |
| **Second primary malignancy** | Very late (years–decades) | Radiation-induced DNA damage in surrounding tissues → field cancerisation + radiation carcinogenesis | Increased risk of SCC, sarcoma, or thyroid cancer in the irradiated field |

<Callout title="Pre-RT Dental Assessment Is Mandatory">
All patients about to undergo head and neck radiotherapy MUST have a comprehensive dental assessment beforehand. Teeth with a hopeless prognosis are extracted BEFORE RT begins, and fluoride trays are fitted. This prevents the devastating complication of osteoradionecrosis, which can occur if a tooth in an irradiated field requires extraction later. ORN is extremely difficult to treat once established.
</Callout>

#### 5.4 Complications of Chemotherapy

- **Oral mucositis** — cytotoxic agents (cisplatin, 5-FU, methotrexate) damage rapidly dividing oral mucosal cells → painful ulceration, secondary infection, poor nutrition. Ice chips during infusion (cryotherapy) can reduce mucositis by causing local vasoconstriction
- **Neutropenic sepsis** — chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression → neutropenia → oral bacteria gain systemic access via mucosal breaks → sepsis
- **Candidiasis** — immunosuppression from chemotherapy predisposes to oral candidiasis

---

### 6. Complications of Salivary Gland Pathology

#### 6.1 Sialolithiasis / Sialadenitis

- **Recurrent infections** — obstructed ducts → stasis → repeated bacterial sialadenitis → progressive gland destruction → chronically damaged, fibrotic gland
- **Abscess formation** — untreated sialadenitis → parotid or submandibular abscess requiring surgical drainage
- **Ranula** — obstruction of sublingual gland duct → mucous extravasation → floor of mouth swelling. A "plunging ranula" extends through the mylohyoid muscle into the neck

#### 6.2 Post-Parotidectomy Complications [24]

- ***Facial nerve injury*** [24] — see Section 5.2 above
- ***Frey syndrome (gustatory sweating)*** [24] — ***aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres → innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels*** [24]
- **Salivary fistula** — leakage of saliva from the surgical wound; usually self-limiting
- **First bite syndrome** — intense pain in the parotid region with the first bite of each meal, due to loss of sympathetic innervation to the parotid; parasympathetic stimulation during eating causes unopposed contraction of myoepithelial cells
- **Aesthetic deformity** — concavity in the parotid region after superficial parotidectomy

---

### 7. Complications of Intubation (Relevant to Oral Structures)

Endotracheal intubation, commonly performed in the context of H&N surgery or any general anaesthesia, can damage oral structures [25]:

***Complications of intubation*** [25]:
- ***Dental damage*** — the most common medicolegal claim related to anaesthesia. The laryngoscope blade can chip or avulse upper incisors, particularly if they are already loose, crowned, or have periodontitis
- ***Lacerations of lips, gums, tongue, pharynx, oesophagus*** [25]
- ***Laryngeal trauma*** [25] — arytenoid dislocation, vocal cord haematoma
- ***Oesophageal or endobronchial intubation*** [25]

---

### 8. Summary Table: Complications by Primary Condition

| Primary Condition | Key Complications |
|---|---|
| Dental caries / abscess | Periapical abscess → cellulitis → Ludwig's angina → mediastinitis → sepsis; cavernous sinus thrombosis; osteomyelitis; IE (in susceptible patients) |
| Periodontal disease | Tooth loss; aspiration pneumonia; cardiovascular association |
| HSV | Herpes keratitis, encephalitis, EM, eczema herpeticum |
| GAS pharyngitis | Quinsy, rheumatic fever, PSGN, scarlet fever, Lemierre syndrome |
| Pemphigus vulgaris | Malnutrition, secondary infection/sepsis, treatment complications (steroid/immunosuppressant side effects) |
| SJS/TEN | Acute skin failure, sepsis, pulmonary complications, late ocular scarring (symblepharon, ankyloblepharon, corneal opacification), urogenital strictures |
| EM | Poor intake, ocular damage, recurrence |
| Behçet disease | Blindness (panuveitis), VTE/arterial aneurysm, neuro-Behçet |
| Leukoplakia / erythroplakia | Malignant transformation to SCC |
| Oral SCC | Local destruction (nerve invasion, bone invasion), LN metastasis, distant metastasis; treatment-related: impaired speech/swallowing, ORN, xerostomia, radiation caries, hypothyroidism |
| Salivary gland disease | Recurrent infection, abscess, facial nerve injury (post-surgery), Frey syndrome |
| Intubation | Dental damage, soft tissue laceration, laryngeal trauma |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Dental infection spread**: Follows fascial planes — periapical abscess → cellulitis → Ludwig's angina (airway emergency) → mediastinitis (40–50% mortality). The "danger triangle of the face" connects mid-face infections to the cavernous sinus via valveless veins.

**HSV complications**: ***Herpes keratitis (commonest cause for corneal transplant), encephalitis (HSV-1, temporal lobe), erythema multiforme (most common trigger)*** [5].

**GAS complications**: Rheumatic fever (molecular mimicry — 2–4 weeks post-infection) and PSGN (immune complex — 1–3 weeks). Peritonsillar abscess → Lemierre syndrome (septic IJV thrombophlebitis).

**SJS/TEN**: ***Acute skin failure → sepsis (27% bacteraemia, main cause of death)*** [21]. ***Late ocular complications in 60% — symblepharon, ankyloblepharon, corneal neovascularisation*** [10]. ***SCORTEN predicts mortality*** [21].

**Pemphigus**: Malnutrition from oral pain; secondary sepsis from denuded mucosa; steroid/immunosuppressant toxicity.

**Oral cancer treatment**: Key surgical complications = impaired speech/swallowing (glossectomy), shoulder drop (radical neck dissection — CN XI sacrifice), Frey syndrome (parotidectomy). Key RT complications = xerostomia (irreversible), osteoradionecrosis (mandible — prevent with pre-RT dental assessment), radiation caries, trismus, hypothyroidism.

**Premalignant lesion risk**: ***Speckled leukoplakia > erythroplakia > floor-of-mouth leukoplakia*** [3]. Oral lichen planus ~1% over 5 years. Regular surveillance is mandatory.
