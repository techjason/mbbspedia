## Complications of Abdominal Pain Conditions

Complications arise when the primary pathology progresses unchecked or as a consequence of treatment itself. Understanding complications from first principles means asking: **"What happens if this disease process continues?"** — the answer is almost always a progression along the spectrum of **inflammation → necrosis → perforation → sepsis → organ failure → death**.

This section covers complications in two broad categories:
1. **Complications of the primary abdominal conditions** (disease-related)
2. **Complications of surgical treatment** (iatrogenic)

---

### I. Complications of Primary Abdominal Conditions

#### A. Acute Appendicitis [3][23][29]

The natural history of untreated appendicitis follows a predictable cascade:

**Luminal obstruction → mucosal inflammation → transmural inflammation → venous congestion (appendiceal artery is an end-artery → no collateral rescue) → ischaemia → gangrene → perforation**

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Perforation*** | Necrosis of the appendiceal wall (worsened by the end-artery blood supply — once the appendiceal artery thromboses, the entire wall becomes ischaemic). Occurs in ***13-20% of patients*** [23]. Risk factors: ***male gender, ↑age, ≥ 3 comorbidities*** [23] | ***Walled-off perforation***: localised RLQ pain, inflammatory mass (phlegmon/abscess). ***Free perforation***: diffuse pain, generalised peritonitis [23]. Suspect when fever > 39.4°C, WBC > 15 × 10⁹/L, imaging shows RLQ fluid collection [29] | Walled-off + stable → Ochsner-Sherren. Free perforation/unstable → emergency appendicectomy [23] |
| ***Appendiceal abscess*** | Localised collection of pus from a walled-off perforation (omentum wraps around the inflamed appendix → containment → but ongoing bacterial proliferation) | Persistent/spiking fever, RLQ mass palpable, failure to improve with antibiotics | IV Abx + percutaneous image-guided drainage ± interval appendicectomy 6-8 weeks [23] |
| ***Generalised peritonitis*** | Free perforation → faecal and bacterial contamination of the entire peritoneal cavity | Diffuse abdominal pain, board-like rigidity, absent bowel sounds, sepsis | Emergency laparotomy + appendicectomy + peritoneal lavage [13][23] |
| ***Pylephlebitis*** (septic portal vein thrombosis) | Septicaemia in the portal venous system from the inflamed appendix → thrombosis and infection propagating via the portal vein → intra-hepatic abscesses [29] | ***High fever, chills, rigors, jaundice*** [29] | IV antibiotics + anticoagulation ± drainage of hepatic abscesses |

**Post-operative complications of appendicectomy** [10][23][29]:

| Timing | Complication | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Early ( < 1 week)** | ***Wound infection (5-10%)*** | Pain and erythema of wound on post-op day 4-5. Usually mixed Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides, Streptococcus). Mx: wound drainage + antibiotics [23] |
| | ***Intra-abdominal / pelvic abscess (~8%)*** | Spiking fever, malaise, anorexia post-op day 5-7. May be interloop, paracolic, pelvic, or subphrenic. Mx: drainage ± laparotomy [23] |
| | ***Post-operative ileus*** | Expected for 24-72h. > 4-5 days indicates continuing intra-abdominal sepsis (especially if fever) [23] |
| | ***Haemorrhage*** | Intra-abdominal, abdominal wall haematoma, scrotal haematoma [23] |
| **Late ( > 1 week)** | ***Adhesions*** | Most common long-term complication of any abdominal surgery. Causes: intestinal obstruction, chronic pelvic pain. Adhesive SBO is the #1 cause of SBO overall [23][25] |
| | ***Enterocutaneous fistula*** | Results from intraperitoneal abscess that fistulises to the skin [29] |
| | ***Stump appendicitis*** | Retained appendiceal stump with recurrent inflammation — rare but dangerous [23] |
| | ***Incisional hernia*** | Abdominal wall defect at the incision site [10] |

> **Why is perforation more common in children and the elderly?** In children, the omentum is underdeveloped and cannot effectively wall off the inflamed appendix → free perforation is more likely. In the elderly, reduced immune response leads to delayed diagnosis and late presentation → the appendix has more time to necrose before treatment.

#### B. Acute Cholecystitis [5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Empyema of gallbladder*** | Pus accumulates in the obstructed gallbladder (secondary bacterial infection in the setting of persistent cystic duct obstruction) | High fever, severe RUQ pain, rigors, high WBC — essentially an intra-abdominal abscess |
| ***Gangrenous cholecystitis*** | Prolonged ischaemia of the gallbladder wall (distension → vascular compromise) → necrosis | Clinical deterioration despite antibiotics; carries high risk of perforation |
| ***Gallbladder perforation*** | Gangrenous wall ruptures → bile and pus leak into the peritoneal cavity | Localised (if contained by adhesions) or generalised peritonitis. Type I (free perforation → peritonitis), Type II (localised abscess), Type III (cholecystoenteric fistula) |
| ***Emphysematous cholecystitis*** | Gas-forming organisms (Clostridium, E. coli) infect the gallbladder wall | Crepitus over RUQ; gas in gallbladder wall on CT. More common in ***diabetics***. Surgical emergency. |
| ***Mirizzi syndrome*** | Impacted stone in the cystic duct or Hartmann's pouch extrinsically compresses the common hepatic duct | Obstructive jaundice mimicking choledocholithiasis but with an intact CBD |
| ***Gallstone ileus*** | Large gallstone erodes through the gallbladder into the adjacent duodenum (cholecystoduodenal fistula) → enters the bowel lumen → impacts at the narrowest point (ileocaecal valve) → mechanical SBO | ***Rigler's triad on AXR: pneumobilia + SBO + ectopic gallstone*** [23]. Elderly women classically affected. |
| ***Cholangitis*** | Stone migrates into or co-existing stone in CBD → stasis + ascending infection | Charcot's triad / Reynold's pentad [2] |

---

#### C. Acute Pancreatitis [7][22][30]

Pancreatitis complications are divided into **local** and **systemic** categories. The Revised Atlanta Classification 2013 provides the framework for local complications.

**Local complications** [22][30]:

| Complication | Definition & Timing | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Acute peripancreatic fluid collection (APFC)*** | Non-encapsulated fluid collection within first 4 weeks; no necrosis | Often asymptomatic; detected incidentally on CT | ***Resolves spontaneously in 7-10 days; no drainage needed*** [30] |
| ***Acute necrotic collection*** | Non-encapsulated collection containing both fluid and necrotic tissue, < 4 weeks | Persistent fever, clinical deterioration | Sterile → conservative. ***Infected necrosis → empirical Abx → step-up approach (percutaneous drainage → surgical necrosectomy if fails)*** [22]. Usually occurs > 10 days post-onset; > 75% monomicrobial with gut-derived organisms [22] |
| ***Pseudocyst*** | Encapsulated fluid collection with well-defined wall; > 4 weeks; no necrotic component | Persistent abdominal pain, palpable epigastric mass, visceral obstruction | Drain if symptomatic, infected, or causing complications [22] |
| ***Walled-off necrosis (WON)*** | Encapsulated necrotic collection with well-defined wall; > 4 weeks | Persistent fever, failure to improve, organ failure | ***Delay interventions > 4 weeks*** (necrotic tissue poorly demarcated early → incomplete debridement → poor outcome). Evaluate by CT/MRI ± EUS-guided FNA. Drain/debride if symptomatic/infected/ongoing organ failure [22] |

> **Why delay drainage/debridement to > 4 weeks?** In the early phase, necrotic tissue is poorly demarcated with intense inflammation. Attempting debridement results in incomplete removal, bleeding, and worsening inflammation. By 4 weeks, the necrosis has "matured" — the wall has formed and the necrotic tissue is better demarcated, making debridement safer and more effective.

**Peripancreatic vascular complications** [30]:
| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Splanchnic venous thrombosis*** | Splenic, portal, or SMV thrombosis from close proximity to the inflammatory process | Hepatic decompensation; compromise of bowel perfusion | Treat underlying pancreatitis (may resolve spontaneously). ***Anticoagulation if extends into portal/SMV*** [22][30] |
| ***Pseudoaneurysm*** | Pancreatic enzyme erosion into adjacent arteries (GDA, left gastric, splenic arteries most common) | Unexplained GI bleeding, ↓Hb, sudden expansion of pancreatic fluid collection [30] | ***Angiographic embolisation*** [30]. ***Endoscopic drainage of collection absolutely contraindicated*** (catastrophic haemorrhage!) [22] |

**Systemic complications** [30]:
- ***Respiratory***: ARDS (inflammatory mediators → alveolar capillary leak → non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema)
- ***Cardiovascular***: coronary artery disease, high-output heart failure
- ***GI***: paralytic ileus, ***abdominal compartment syndrome*** (tissue oedema + ascites + ileus → intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg + new organ failure → ***surgical decompression***) [22]
- ***Renal***: acute kidney injury (hypovolaemia, SIRS, nephrotoxic drugs)
- ***Haematology***: retroperitoneal bleeding (haemorrhagic pancreatitis → Cullen's sign, Grey Turner's sign, Fox's sign)
- ***Endocrine***: insulin deficiency → hyperglycaemia (destruction of islet cells)
- ***SIRS → organ failure***: the leading cause of early mortality in pancreatitis. Cytokine cascade (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) → multiorgan dysfunction [7][30]

---

#### D. Intestinal Obstruction [25][29]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Prognosis |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Strangulation*** | Blood supply compromised from: ↑intraluminal pressure, direct pressure on bowel wall, or interrupted mesenteric blood flow → ischaemia → necrosis → perforation [29] | ***Continuous/worsening pain*** (cf. intermittent colicky pain of simple obstruction), ***fever, tachycardia, peritoneal signs*** [29]. Biochemical: leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis. Radiological: ***pneumoperitoneum, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas*** [29] | ***Mortality: 2% (non-strangulated) vs 10-30% (strangulated)*** [26] |
| ***Closed-loop obstruction*** | Obstruction at two points along the bowel → isolated segment cannot decompress in either direction → rapid rise in intraluminal pressure → ischaemia | Rapid clinical deterioration; volvulus is a classic example | Surgical emergency — cannot resolve with conservative management |
| ***Perforation*** | Necrotic bowel wall ruptures → faecal peritonitis | Pneumoperitoneum on CXR/AXR; generalised peritonitis | Emergency laparotomy |
| ***Aspiration pneumonia*** | Proximal bowel distension → vomiting → aspiration (especially in obtunded patients or those without NGT decompression) | Respiratory distress post-emesis; CXR infiltrates | Antibiotics; intubation if severe; prevention by NGT |
| ***Dehydration and electrolyte disturbance*** | Third-space fluid sequestration into dilated bowel loops + vomiting losses → intravascular depletion + electrolyte derangement | Tachycardia, ↓BP, ↓UO, ↑urea:Cr ratio; hypokalaemia (vomiting), metabolic alkalosis (loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ in vomitus) | Aggressive IV fluid and electrolyte replacement |
| ***Bacterial translocation and sepsis*** | Bacterial overgrowth in stagnant bowel contents → disrupted mucosal barrier (ischaemia) → bacteria translocate across bowel wall into peritoneal cavity/bloodstream | Fever, SIRS, septic shock | IV broad-spectrum antibiotics; source control (surgery) |

---

#### E. Diverticulitis [11][29][30]

| Complication | Frequency/Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Abscess*** | Occurs in ***17%*** of acute diverticulitis. Microperforation contained by pericolic tissues/mesentery [29] | ***Persistent fever and no improvement in abdominal pain despite 3 days of antibiotics*** [29]. May lead to pyogenic liver abscess via portal circulation [29] | Small ( < 4-5 cm) → IV Abx. Large ( > 4-5 cm) → percutaneous CT-guided drainage [26] |
| ***Fistula*** | Inflammation erodes into adjacent organs. ***Most commonly colovesical*** (bladder), followed by ***colovaginal*** (especially post-hysterectomy) [29] | ***Colovesical***: pneumaturia, fecaluria, recurrent dysuria/UTI [11][29]. ***Colovaginal***: vaginal passage of faeces and flatus [29] | Control sepsis → resect affected colon segment + primary repair of secondarily involved organ [29] |
| ***Obstruction*** | Partial: pericolonic inflammation/abscess compressing lumen. Complete: ***progressive fibrosis and scarring*** from recurrent attacks → stricture formation [29] | Abdominal pain + distension + vomiting + constipation. Hyperactive bowel sounds (mechanical) or absent (paralytic ileus from peritoneal inflammation) [29] | Conservative initially; surgical resection for complete obstruction or stricture |
| ***Perforation*** | Rupture of diverticular abscess into peritoneal cavity (purulent peritonitis) OR rupture of inflamed diverticulum with faecal contamination (faecal peritonitis) [29] | Haemodynamic instability (hypotension, shock); peritoneal signs (guarding, rigidity, rebound); absent bowel sounds [29] | Emergency surgery: Hartmann's procedure (Hinchey 3-4) [26] |
| ***Diverticular bleeding*** | ***Rupture of vasa recta*** at the neck of the diverticulum (the artery is draped over the dome of the diverticulum where it is most vulnerable) | ***Painless massive PR bleeding*** [11] — this is the ***most common cause of massive lower GI bleeding*** [26]. Dark/maroon (right-sided) vs bright red (left-sided) [26] | Majority (80%) self-limiting. Colonoscopy is initial diagnostic + therapeutic procedure. Failed → angiography/RBC scan → segmental colectomy [26] |
| ***Chronic sequelae*** [26] | Chronic pain (persistent low-grade diverticulitis or IBS-related); diverticular colitis (IBD-like segmental colitis); diverticular stricture → chronic/acute obstruction | Variable | Depends on specific sequela |

> **Why is diverticular bleeding painless?** Diverticular bleeding occurs from rupture of the vasa recta WITHOUT significant inflammation. This distinguishes it from diverticulitis (which has inflammation but rarely bleeds). The two conditions ***rarely coexist*** [26].

#### F. Peptic Ulcer Disease [6]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding*** | Ulcer erodes into a blood vessel (gastroduodenal artery in posterior DU is a classic site) | Haematemesis (frank blood or coffee-ground), melaena, haematochezia (if massive) [6] |
| ***Perforation*** | Ulcer erodes through all layers of the gut wall → peritonitis | Sudden severe epigastric pain → generalised; board-like rigidity; ↓liver dullness [2] |
| ***Penetration*** | Ulcer erodes through serosa but is contained by adhesion to an adjacent organ (pancreas posteriorly for DU; liver for GU) | Change in pain character: ***more intense, longer duration, shift to localised back pain, NOT relieved by food or antacids*** [6] |
| ***Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO)*** | Chronic ulceration at the pylorus or duodenal bulb → fibrosis + scarring + oedema → narrowing of the lumen | Epigastric pain after eating, early satiety, bloating, nausea/vomiting, weight loss. ***Succussion splash*** on examination [6]. Dehydration + hypokalaemic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis (loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ in vomitus) |
| ***Fistulisation*** | Gastrocolic or duodenocolic fistula (ulcer erodes into adjacent colon) | Feculent vomiting, postprandial diarrhoea, dyspepsia, weight loss [6] |

---

#### G. Inflammatory Bowel Disease

**Ulcerative Colitis** [16][30]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Stricture*** | Repeated inflammation → muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis → luminal narrowing. ***Should be considered malignant until proven otherwise*** by endoscopy + biopsy [30] | Endoscopy + biopsy to exclude malignancy |
| ***Fulminant colitis*** | Severe pan-colonic inflammation → > 10 stools/day, continuous bleeding, abdominal pain, distension, ***acute severe toxic symptoms*** (fever, anorexia, tachycardia) [30] | Medical: IV steroids, cyclosporine/infliximab. Surgical: ***total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy*** if refractory [30] |
| ***Toxic megacolon*** | Inflammation extends beyond mucosa to involve muscle layers → loss of colonic tone → ***non-obstructive dilatation ≥ 6 cm or caecum > 9 cm*** + systemic toxicity [30] | Bowel rest + TPN + IV steroids + electrolyte correction. Failure → emergency surgery |
| ***Perforation*** | Most commonly as consequence of toxic megacolon → necrotic, dilated bowel wall ruptures | Generalised peritonitis; ***high mortality*** [30] | Emergency surgery |
| ***Colorectal cancer*** | Chronic mucosal inflammation → dysplasia → carcinoma sequence. Risk increases with disease duration and extent | Regular ***endoscopic surveillance*** in long-standing disease [30] |

**Crohn's Disease** [30]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Fistula formation*** | ***Transmural inflammation*** → sinus tracts penetrate serosa → connect to adjacent organs [30] | Enteroenteric (palpable mass), enterovesical (UTI, pneumaturia), enterovaginal (passage of gas/faeces per vaginum), enterocutaneous (skin drainage), retroperitoneal (psoas abscess, hydronephrosis) [30] |
| ***Abscess formation*** | Sinus tract leads to walled-off collection | Acute localised peritonitis, fever, tenderness [30] |
| ***Stricture / Intestinal obstruction*** | Chronic transmural inflammation → fibrosis → luminal narrowing | Colicky pain, distension, vomiting. Strictureplasty or resection |
| ***Perianal disease*** | Terminal ileum → rectal involvement → perianal inflammation | Skin tags, anal fissures, perirectal abscess, anorectal fistulas [30] |
| ***Malnutrition*** | Reduced intake (food fear), malabsorption (inflamed/resected ileum), protein-losing enteropathy | Weight loss, vitamin deficiencies (B12, fat-soluble vitamins), anaemia |

#### H. Ruptured AAA [9]

***Complications of ruptured AAA and its repair*** [9]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Massive blood loss and transfusion-related effects*** | Haemorrhagic shock; DIC, hypothermia from massive transfusion [9] |
| ***Cardiorespiratory complications*** | Haemodynamic stress of rupture and aortic clamping → myocardial ischaemia, arrhythmias |
| ***Renal failure*** | Shock (pre-renal) or suprarenal aortic clamping (direct renal ischaemia) [9] |
| ***Bowel ischaemia*** | ***Much higher risk than in non-ruptured AAA*** [9] — IMA ligation during repair + hypotension → colonic ischaemia |
| ***Paralytic ileus*** | Retroperitoneal haematoma irritates the autonomic plexus → bowel dysmotility [9] |
| ***Abdominal compartment syndrome*** | Reperfusion injury → massive tissue oedema + ascites → intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mmHg + new organ failure → ***decompressive laparotomy*** [9] |
| ***Graft infection*** | Late complication; aortoenteric fistula (graft erodes into duodenum → GI bleeding) is a feared complication |

**Complications of elective AAA repair (EVAR-specific)** [9]:
- ***Endoleak***: persistent blood flow into the aneurysm sac outside the graft. Types I-V classified by source of leak [9]. Type I (attachment site) and Type III (graft defect) require intervention. Type II (retrograde flow from branch vessels) — most common, usually benign.
- ***Graft migration, limb thrombosis, graft infection***

---

### II. General Post-Operative Complications

Any abdominal surgery can result in complications classified by **timing** [10]:

| Timing | Category | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| ***Immediate ( < 1h)*** | **Local** | Primary haemorrhage (bleeding from an unsecured vessel), damage to neighbouring structures |
| | **Systemic** | Shock (blood loss), atelectasis (anaesthesia → reduced surfactant, shallow breathing) |
| | **Laparoscopy-specific** | Organ puncture, vascular injury, nerve injury, port-site hernia; pneumoperitoneum-related: subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, arrhythmia [10] |
| ***Early (24-48h)*** | **Local** | ***Reactionary haemorrhage*** (within 24h: vasoconstriction during surgical stress masks a bleeding vessel → when stress response wanes, vessel dilates → bleeding) [10] |
| | **Systemic** | Acute confusion (dehydration, sepsis), pneumonia, AROU, UTI [10] |
| ***Late ( > 48h)*** | **Local** | ***Wound infection*** (post-op day 4-5); ***secondary haemorrhage*** (7-10 days post-op: pseudoaneurysm from infection → mesenteric angiogram for diagnosis) [10]; ***adhesive intestinal obstruction***; ***incisional hernia*** [10] |
| | **Systemic** | Fever, acute confusion, cardiac (arrhythmia, MI), DVT/PE [10] |

**Anastomotic complications** (specific to bowel surgery) [29]:

| Complication | Timing | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Anastomotic bleeding*** | Early ( < 30 days) | PR bleeding, haemodynamic instability | Blood transfusion + correct coagulopathy [29] |
| ***Anastomotic leakage*** | Early (day 5-7) | ***Pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent or purulent drainage***. Radiological: fluid/gas-containing collections [29] | Fluid resuscitation + broad-spectrum IV Abx + bowel rest + image-guided percutaneous drainage ± fecal diversion or re-operation [29] |
| ***Anastomotic stricture*** | Late ( > 30 days) | Features of partial/subacute obstruction | Finger dilatation (low) or endoscopic balloon dilatation (high) [29] |
| ***Anastomotic fistula*** | Late ( > 30 days) | Enterocutaneous (most close spontaneously), rectovaginal, rectourinary [29] | Enterocutaneous → conservative. Rectovaginal/rectourinary → proximal fecal diversion [29] |

**Stoma complications** [29]:

| Timing | Complication | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Early** | Stomal bleeding, stomal necrosis (ischaemia), stomal retraction, mucocutaneous separation | Necrosis: dusky/black stoma — may need revision. Retraction: stoma sinks below skin level → poor appliance fit → leakage |
| | ***Skin irritation and dermatitis*** | ***Most common in end and loop ileostomy*** due to ***high-output and highly alkaline enzymatic effluent*** [29] — the proteolytic enzymes digest the skin |
| **Late** | ***Parastomal hernia***, stomal prolapse, stomal stenosis | Parastomal hernia: most common long-term stoma complication (fascial defect around the stoma allows bowel herniation) |

---

### III. Complications of Specific Medical Causes of Abdominal Pain

#### DKA [19]

- ***Cerebral oedema*** (especially in children during treatment — rapid correction of glucose/osmolality causes osmotic fluid shifts into brain cells)
- ***Hypokalaemia*** during treatment (insulin drives K⁺ intracellularly; always replace K⁺ before or with insulin infusion)
- ***ARDS*** (severe cases)
- ***Aspiration pneumonia*** (obtunded patient with vomiting)
- ***Mucormycosis*** (rhinocerebral fungal infection in poorly controlled diabetics)
- ***Recurrent DKA*** if precipitant not addressed

#### Ruptured Ectopic Pregnancy

- ***Haemoperitoneum → haemorrhagic shock***
- ***Infertility*** (tubal damage — especially if salpingectomy required)
- ***Recurrent ectopic*** (15% risk in subsequent pregnancies)
- ***Tubal adhesions*** (from inflammation)

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Appendicitis complications**: Perforation (13-20%) → walled-off abscess or generalised peritonitis. Post-op: wound infection (5-10%), intra-abdominal abscess (~8%), adhesions (long-term SBO risk), pylephlebitis (rare but serious).

2. **Cholecystitis complications**: Empyema → gangrenous cholecystitis → perforation → peritonitis. Emphysematous cholecystitis (diabetics, gas-formers). Mirizzi syndrome. Gallstone ileus (Rigler's triad: pneumobilia + SBO + ectopic stone).

3. **Pancreatitis complications**: Local: APFC (resolves spontaneously), acute necrotic collection, pseudocyst, WON (delay intervention > 4 weeks). Vascular: splanchnic thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm (angiographic embolisation — NEVER drain collection endoscopically!). Systemic: ARDS, AKI, abdominal compartment syndrome, SIRS → organ failure.

4. **IO complications**: Strangulation (mortality 10-30% vs 2% non-strangulated). Signs: continuous pain, fever, tachycardia, peritoneal signs, metabolic acidosis, pneumatosis, portal venous gas. Closed-loop obstruction is a surgical emergency.

5. **Diverticulitis complications**: Abscess (17%), fistula (colovesical MC → pneumaturia, fecaluria), obstruction (fibrosis/stricture), perforation (Hinchey 3-4), diverticular bleeding (painless massive PR bleed — MC cause of massive LGIB).

6. **PUD complications**: Bleeding, perforation, penetration, GOO (succussion splash, hypokalaemic hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis), fistulisation.

7. **UC complications**: Stricture (malignant until proven otherwise), fulminant colitis, toxic megacolon (≥ 6 cm + systemic toxicity), perforation, CRC (surveillance needed).

8. **Anastomotic leakage**: Day 5-7 post-op. Pain + fever + tachycardia + feculent drainage. Mx: IV Abx + drainage ± re-operation.

9. **Reactionary haemorrhage**: Within 24h (stress vasoconstriction wanes → bleeding). Secondary haemorrhage: 7-10 days (pseudoaneurysm from infection → "warning bleed" then torrential bleed).

10. **Stoma dermatitis**: Worst with ileostomy (alkaline proteolytic effluent digests skin).

      question: "A patient with acute pancreatitis develops an expanding epigastric fluid collection on CT at day 14. What is the diagnosis, and why should you delay intervention until more than 4 weeks?",
      markscheme: "Diagnosis: acute necrotic collection (or walled-off necrosis if encapsulated). Delay intervention beyond 4 weeks because in early phase, necrotic tissue is poorly demarcated with intense inflammation. Early debridement leads to incomplete removal, bleeding, and worsening inflammation. By 4 weeks, a wall has formed and necrosis is better demarcated, making drainage and debridement safer and more effective."
    },
    {
      question: "Why is diverticular bleeding painless, and why does it rarely coexist with diverticulitis?",
      markscheme: "Diverticular bleeding is painless because it results from rupture of vasa recta without significant inflammation (purely mechanical vascular event). Diverticulitis is an inflammatory process around the diverticulum. The two rarely coexist because the pathophysiology is different: bleeding involves vascular rupture at the diverticular neck, while diverticulitis involves luminal obstruction with bacterial overgrowth causing inflammation. Inflammation actually tends to tamponade the vasa recta."
    },
    {
      question: "What is Rigler's triad and what condition does it indicate? Explain the pathophysiology.",
      markscheme: "Rigler's triad on AXR: pneumobilia (gas in biliary tree) plus SBO plus ectopic gallstone. Indicates gallstone ileus. Pathophysiology: large gallstone erodes through inflamed gallbladder wall into adjacent duodenum via cholecystoduodenal fistula (the fistula allows air to enter the biliary tree causing pneumobilia). The stone then passes through the bowel and impacts at the narrowest point (ileocaecal valve), causing mechanical SBO."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between reactionary and secondary haemorrhage post-operatively? Include timing and mechanism.",
      markscheme: "Reactionary haemorrhage: within 24h post-op. Mechanism: vasoconstriction during surgical stress and sympathetic response masks a bleeding vessel. When the stress response wanes, the vessel dilates and bleeding resumes. Secondary haemorrhage: 7-10 days post-op. Mechanism: infection at the surgical site causes pseudoaneurysm formation or erosion of a blood vessel. Classically presents with a warning bleed followed 4-6 hours later by torrential bleeding."
    },
    {
      question: "List 3 complications of acute cholecystitis and explain why emphysematous cholecystitis is more common in diabetics.",
      markscheme: "Complications: empyema, gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, emphysematous cholecystitis, Mirizzi syndrome, gallstone ileus. Emphysematous cholecystitis is more common in diabetics because: diabetic microangiopathy compromises gallbladder wall perfusion leading to ischaemia, creating an anaerobic environment. Gas-forming organisms (Clostridium, E. coli) thrive in ischaemic/necrotic tissue. Also, diabetic immunosuppression impairs the ability to control these infections."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient with ulcerative colitis develops abdominal distension with colonic dilatation of 8 cm on AXR plus fever and tachycardia. What is the diagnosis and what is the feared complication?",
      markscheme: "Diagnosis: toxic megacolon (non-obstructive colonic dilatation >= 6 cm or caecum > 9 cm plus systemic toxicity including fever, tachycardia, hypotension, electrolyte disturbances). Feared complication: perforation. When inflammatory process extends beyond mucosa to involve muscle layers, colonic tone is lost leading to dilatation. The thinned, inflamed wall is at high risk of rupturing, causing faecal peritonitis with high mortality."
