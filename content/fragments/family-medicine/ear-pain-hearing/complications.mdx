## Complications of Ear Pain and Hearing Loss Conditions

Complications in otology are best understood by following the **anatomical paths of spread** — infection and disease propagate along paths of least resistance: through natural bony dehiscences, along blood vessels, through the Eustachian tube, across the tegmen tympani into the middle cranial fossa, or posteriorly into the mastoid and sigmoid sinus. Understanding the anatomy explains every complication from first principles.

### 1. Complications of Otitis Externa

#### 1.1 Uncomplicated OE

Most OE resolves with topical treatment without significant complications. However:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Chronic/recurrent OE** | Inadequate treatment, persistent moisture exposure, underlying eczema/psoriasis → chronic inflammation → EAC skin thickening and stenosis | Persistent pruritus, discharge; narrowed EAC on otoscopy; hearing loss if severe stenosis |
| **EAC stenosis** | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis and cicatricial narrowing of the canal | Progressive CHL; difficulty fitting hearing aids; requires surgical canalplasty if severe |
| **Myringitis (TM involvement)** | Direct spread of infection from EAC skin to the outer squamous layer of the TM | Pain, bullae on TM (bullous myringitis); bloody discharge if bullae rupture |
| **Perichondritis → auricular cartilage necrosis** | Infection spreads from EAC skin to adjacent auricular perichondrium; cartilage is avascular (relies on perichondrium for blood supply) → compromised perichondrium → cartilage ischaemia → necrosis | Red, swollen, tender pinna (sparing lobule); if untreated → "cauliflower ear" deformity from cartilage destruction and fibrosis |

#### 1.2 Necrotising Otitis Externa — Complications

This is where OE becomes life-threatening. ***Necrotising otitis externa*** [1] is a serious disorder for a reason — it spreads along the skull base.

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Skull base osteomyelitis** | *Pseudomonas* invades from the EAC soft tissue through the fissures of Santorini → temporal bone periosteum → progressive osteomyelitis spreading along the skull base | Severe deep pain disproportionate to exam findings; elevated ESR > 70; CT shows bony erosion |
| **Facial nerve palsy (CN VII)** — most common CN involved | CN VII runs through the stylomastoid foramen adjacent to the inferior EAC; infection at the skull base reaches the nerve early | Ipsilateral LMN facial palsy; inability to close eye, droop of mouth. Poor prognostic indicator |
| **Other cranial nerve palsies (IX, X, XI, XII)** | Progressive skull base osteomyelitis extends medially to the jugular foramen (CN IX, X, XI) and hypoglossal canal (CN XII) | Dysphagia and dysphonia (IX, X); shoulder weakness (XI); tongue deviation (XII); multiple CN palsies = very poor prognosis |
| **Contralateral spread** | Infection crosses the midline via the clivus or petrous apex | Bilateral CN palsies; extremely rare but devastating |
| **Meningitis / intracranial abscess** | Osteomyelitis erodes through the skull base into the posterior or middle cranial fossa | Headache, fever, meningism, altered consciousness; CT/MRI shows meningeal enhancement or abscess |
| **Sigmoid sinus thrombosis** | Infection adjacent to the sigmoid sinus → venous wall inflammation → thrombosis | Severe headache, fever, raised ICP signs; MRV demonstrates non-filling of sigmoid sinus |
| **Death** | Multi-organ sepsis or intracranial complications | Mortality ~10–20% even with aggressive treatment; higher if cranial nerves are involved at presentation |

> **Why is CN VII affected first?** The facial nerve exits the skull through the stylomastoid foramen, which is located just posterior to the tympanic bone — very close to the floor of the EAC and the fissures of Santorini where *Pseudomonas* first invades bone. Geographically, it is the nearest cranial nerve to the primary infection site.

### 2. Complications of Acute Otitis Media (AOM)

AOM is the commonest cause of ear pain in children [1] [6]. While most episodes are self-limiting, complications arise when infection is uncontrolled and spreads beyond the middle ear cavity.

#### 2.1 Extracranial (Temporal Bone) Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **TM perforation** | Purulent middle ear effusion under positive pressure → ischaemic necrosis of the TM → spontaneous rupture | Sudden pain relief (pressure released) + purulent otorrhoea; most acute perforations heal spontaneously within weeks |
| ***Acute mastoiditis*** [1] | Infection spreads from the middle ear through the aditus ad antrum to the mastoid air cells → suppuration → destruction of bony septae between air cells (coalescent mastoiditis) | Post-auricular erythema, swelling, tenderness; pinna displaced anteroinferiorly; ***a serious disorder not to be missed*** [1] |
| **Subperiosteal abscess** | Coalescent mastoiditis → pus erodes through the mastoid cortex (usually the lateral cortex) → accumulates between bone and periosteum | Fluctuant, tender post-auricular mass; pinna pushed forward and outward; requires surgical drainage |
| **Petrous apicitis (Gradenigo syndrome)** | Infection extends from mastoid to petrous apex → inflammation near Dorello's canal (CN VI) and trigeminal ganglion (CN V) | Classic triad: (1) retro-orbital pain (CN V1), (2) CN VI palsy (lateral rectus palsy → diplopia with abduction deficit), (3) otorrhoea/middle ear infection. Rare but important for exams |
| **Facial nerve palsy** | CN VII runs through the middle ear in its tympanic (horizontal) segment, often with bony dehiscence in ~30% of the population; AOM → oedema and inflammation compress the nerve within its bony canal | Ipsilateral LMN facial weakness during or after an episode of AOM; usually resolves with adequate treatment of the infection (antibiotics + myringotomy) |
| **Labyrinthitis** | Infection spreads from the middle ear into the inner ear via the round window membrane or through a labyrinthine fistula | Severe vertigo, nystagmus, SNHL, nausea/vomiting during or after AOM; the triad of middle ear infection + vertigo + hearing loss |
| **Bezold's abscess** | Pus tracks from the mastoid tip inferiorly, breaking through the medial surface of the tip along the insertion of the sternocleidomastoid and posterior belly of digastric → deep neck space infection | Neck mass below and behind the ear along the SCM; torticollis (head tilted toward the abscess); fever; deep neck tenderness |

> **Why does mastoiditis cause the pinna to be pushed forward?** The subperiosteal abscess forms on the lateral cortex of the mastoid process, which sits BEHIND the pinna. The expanding collection pushes the overlying pinna anteriorly, inferiorly, and laterally. This is a classic clinical sign.

#### 2.2 Intracranial Complications

These are the most feared complications of AOM/mastoiditis. They arise because the middle ear and mastoid are separated from the middle and posterior cranial fossae by only thin bone (tegmen tympani) — and in some individuals this bone has natural dehiscences.

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Meningitis** | Most common intracranial complication; infection spreads through the tegmen tympani or through pre-formed pathways (eg. labyrinthine windows, bony dehiscences, or haematogenous) → subarachnoid space infection | Headache, fever, neck stiffness, photophobia, positive Kernig's/Brudzinski's signs; LP: ↑WCC, ↑protein, ↓glucose, positive Gram stain/culture |
| **Epidural abscess** | Infection erodes through the tegmen → pus accumulates between dura and bone | May be clinically silent (discovered incidentally on CT); or headache, low-grade fever; usually found during mastoidectomy |
| **Subdural empyema** | Infection penetrates the dura → pus in the subdural space | Rapidly progressive: high fever, headache, altered consciousness, seizures, focal neurological deficits; neurosurgical emergency |
| **Brain abscess** | Haematogenous spread or direct extension → parenchymal infection, most commonly in the temporal lobe (adjacent to tegmen) or cerebellum (adjacent to posterior fossa/sigmoid sinus area) | Headache, fever, focal neurological signs (depending on location), raised ICP; CT/MRI: ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding oedema |
| **Sigmoid/lateral sinus thrombosis** | Infection from the mastoid (which abuts the sigmoid sinus plate) → venous wall inflammation → thrombophlebitis → thrombosis of the sigmoid or lateral sinus | "Picket fence" fever (spiking, swinging); headache; raised ICP (impaired venous drainage); Griesinger's sign (oedema over the mastoid emissary vein); papilloedema; MRV: non-filling of sinus |
| **Otitic hydrocephalus** | Sigmoid/lateral sinus thrombosis → impaired CSF absorption (CSF drains via the arachnoid granulations into the venous sinuses, mainly the superior sagittal sinus; major lateral/sigmoid sinus thrombosis, especially if on the dominant side, impairs overall venous outflow → raised ICP) | Headache, papilloedema, CN VI palsy (false localising sign from raised ICP stretching CN VI over petrous apex); normal brain parenchyma on imaging |

> **Why temporal lobe abscess from ear disease?** The tegmen tympani — the thin bony plate forming the roof of the middle ear — is also the floor of the middle cranial fossa. The temporal lobe sits directly above it. Infection eroding through the tegmen has immediate access to the temporal lobe.

> **Why cerebellar abscess from ear disease?** The posterior wall of the mastoid is the anterior wall of the posterior fossa. The sigmoid sinus plate separates the mastoid from the cerebellum. Erosion through this bone or septic emboli from sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis can seed the cerebellum.

<Callout title="Classic Exam Question — Route of Intracranial Spread" type="idea">
**Middle ear infection → intracranial complication routes:**
1. **Upward** through tegmen tympani → middle cranial fossa → epidural abscess / temporal lobe abscess / meningitis
2. **Posteriorly** through sigmoid sinus plate → posterior fossa → cerebellar abscess / sigmoid sinus thrombosis
3. **Medially** through labyrinthine windows → labyrinthitis → meningitis (via IAM and cochlear aqueduct)
4. **Haematogenous** via diploic or emissary veins → brain abscess at any location
</Callout>

### 3. Complications of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM)

CSOM can produce all the same intracranial complications as AOM, but typically more insidiously. The key distinction is that CSOM is divided into:

- **Safe (tubotympanic) type**: central perforation, mucosal disease → lower complication rate
- **Unsafe (atticoantral) type**: marginal/attic perforation, often with ***cholesteatoma*** [1] → higher complication rate

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Conductive hearing loss** | Persistent TM perforation (↓surface area for sound collection) + chronic mucosal inflammation → ossicular erosion (incus long process most vulnerable) |
| **Tympanosclerosis** | Chronic inflammation → hyaline degeneration and calcification of TM fibrous layer and middle ear mucosa; may fix ossicles → CHL |
| **Cholesterol granuloma** | Chronic OME → haemorrhage → cholesterol crystals released from lysed RBCs → foreign body giant cell reaction → granuloma; appears as blue/dark mass behind TM |
| **All intracranial complications** (as above) | Same pathways as AOM but with a more chronic, smouldering course |

---

### 4. Complications of Cholesteatoma

***Cholesteatoma*** [1] is essentially a complication factory. The keratinising squamous epithelium produces collagenases and activates osteoclasts, causing relentless bone erosion in all directions.

| Structure Eroded | Complication | Clinical Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Ossicles** (incus long process first, then stapes superstructure, then malleus) | **Progressive conductive hearing loss** | Worsening CHL over months/years; audiometry shows increasing air-bone gap |
| **Lateral semicircular canal** | **Labyrinthine fistula → vertigo** | Episodic or positional vertigo; positive fistula test (pressure applied to EAC via pneumatic otoscope → vertigo and nystagmus); Hennebert sign. SNHL may co-occur if cochlea is involved → **mixed hearing loss** |
| **Facial nerve canal** (tympanic or mastoid segment) | **Facial nerve palsy** | Gradual onset LMN facial palsy; cholesteatoma is the most common cause of facial palsy in chronic ear disease. **Urgent surgical exploration required** |
| **Tegmen tympani** (roof of middle ear/mastoid) | **Meningitis, epidural abscess, temporal lobe abscess** | As described above for AOM intracranial complications; more insidious onset |
| **Sigmoid sinus plate** | **Sigmoid sinus thrombosis, cerebellar abscess** | As above |
| **Cochlea** | **Sensorineural hearing loss** | Irreversible damage to cochlear structures; combined with ossicular CHL → mixed HL |
| **Dural plate** | **CSF leak (otorrhoea)** | Clear, watery discharge; β2-transferrin positive in CSF [12]; risk of ascending meningitis |

> **Why is the incus eroded first?** The incus long process is the thinnest, most vulnerable part of the ossicular chain and it sits in the direct path of cholesteatoma expansion in the posterosuperior retraction pocket/attic. It also has a tenuous blood supply — the lenticular process (tip connecting to stapes) is supplied by a single end artery.

---

### 5. Complications of Acute Mastoiditis

Mastoiditis is itself a complication of AOM, but it can further complicate into:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Subperiosteal abscess** | Pus erodes through lateral mastoid cortex → collection between bone and periosteum |
| **Bezold's abscess** | Pus tracks through mastoid tip → deep to SCM into the neck |
| **Citelli's abscess** | Pus tracks through the digastric groove → posterior triangle of neck |
| **Luc's abscess** | Pus tracks superiorly through the zygomatic root → temporal fossa |
| **All intracranial complications** | As described above — meningitis, brain abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, epidural/subdural collections |

---

### 6. Complications of Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (Herpes Zoster Oticus)

***Herpes zoster — Ramsay Hunt syndrome*** [1].

| Complication | Mechanism | Prognosis |
|---|---|---|
| **Permanent facial nerve palsy** | VZV causes axonal degeneration (not just oedema/conduction block as in Bell's palsy) within the bony fallopian canal → wallerian degeneration → incomplete reinnervation | Complete recovery in only ~50–70% (vs ~85–95% in Bell's palsy); worse if treatment delayed > 72 hours |
| **Sensorineural hearing loss** | VZV spreads from geniculate ganglion of CN VII to CN VIII (cochlear component) in the IAM — the two nerves run together | May be permanent; high-frequency loss most common |
| **Vestibular dysfunction** | VZV involves the vestibular component of CN VIII | Acute vertigo; most patients compensate centrally over weeks–months |
| **Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)** | Chronic neuropathic pain from damaged sensory neurons in the geniculate ganglion; aberrant neural remodelling after acute inflammation | Burning, lancinating ear pain persisting > 3 months after acute episode; more common in elderly |
| **Synkinesis (aberrant reinnervation)** | Following severe axonal damage, regenerating fibres may take wrong paths → involuntary movements accompanying voluntary ones | Eg. mouth twitches when blinking (ocular-oral synkinesis); "crocodile tears" (gustatory lacrimation) — salivatory fibres regenerate into lacrimal pathways |
| **Corneal complications** | CN VII palsy → lagophthalmos → corneal exposure → ***corneal drying and abrasions*** [11] → ulceration → perforation if severe | Requires aggressive eye care: artificial tears, lubricant ointment, taping eyelid shut at night; gold weight implant if chronic [11] |

---

### 7. Complications of Hearing Loss (All Causes)

Hearing loss itself — regardless of aetiology — has profound secondary consequences. These are frequently underappreciated.

| Complication | Mechanism | Population Most Affected |
|---|---|---|
| **Speech and language delay** | Hearing is essential for auditory feedback during speech development; the critical period for language acquisition is 0–3 years; deprivation during this window causes irreversible deficits | Children with congenital or early-onset SNHL; this is why **neonatal hearing screening** and **early intervention by 6 months** are so critical |
| **Cognitive decline and dementia** | Lancet Commission on Dementia (2024): hearing loss is the **largest modifiable risk factor for dementia** (accounting for ~8% of cases). Mechanisms: (1) increased cognitive load from effortful listening, (2) reduced auditory input → cortical atrophy, (3) social isolation | Elderly with presbycusis; correctable with hearing aids — evidence suggests hearing aids reduce cognitive decline |
| **Social isolation and depression** | Inability to participate in conversation, especially in noisy environments ("cocktail party" difficulty) → withdrawal from social activities → loneliness → depression | All ages, particularly elderly and adolescents |
| **Reduced educational attainment** | Children with untreated hearing loss struggle in classrooms → poor academic performance | Children with OME (glue ear) or undiagnosed SNHL |
| **Safety hazards** | Cannot hear alarms, sirens, traffic, warning shouts | All age groups |
| **Tinnitus and psychological distress** | Cochlear damage commonly produces tinnitus; chronic tinnitus causes anxiety, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, depression; in severe cases, suicidal ideation | Patients with NIHL, presbycusis, Ménière's disease |

<Callout title="Hearing Loss and Dementia — High Yield" type="idea">
The Lancet Commission on Dementia Prevention (2024) identifies **mid-life hearing loss** as the single **largest potentially modifiable risk factor** for dementia, ahead of hypertension, obesity, depression, and smoking. The proposed mechanisms include cognitive load hypothesis (brain diverts resources from memory and executive function to decoding degraded auditory input), sensory deprivation (reduced input → temporal lobe atrophy), and social isolation. **Treating hearing loss with hearing aids may delay or prevent cognitive decline** — a powerful argument for early audiological intervention.
</Callout>

### 8. Complications of Ménière's Disease

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Progressive SNHL** | Repeated endolymphatic hydrops episodes → cumulative hair cell damage → hearing worsens with each attack; initially low-frequency, eventually all frequencies ("burnt-out" Ménière's with flat SNHL) |
| **Drop attacks (Tumarkin's crises)** | Sudden otolith-mediated vestibular stimulation → sudden fall without loss of consciousness; extremely dangerous — risk of fractures, head injury |
| **Chronic imbalance** | Progressive bilateral vestibular hypofunction → difficulty maintaining balance, especially in the dark (when visual compensation is absent) |
| **Psychological morbidity** | Unpredictable attacks of severe vertigo, nausea, hearing loss → anxiety, agoraphobia (fear of attacks in public), depression; significant impact on quality of life and employment |
| **Bilateral disease** | ~15–40% develop contralateral involvement over time → bilateral fluctuating SNHL and vestibular dysfunction; further limits rehabilitation options |

---

### 9. Complications of Otosclerosis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Progressive conductive hearing loss** | Continued spongiotic bone remodelling at oval window → increasing stapes fixation |
| **Mixed/sensorineural hearing loss** (cochlear otosclerosis) | Spongiotic foci extend from the anterior oval window to the cochlear capsule → disruption of the spiral ligament and stria vascularis → cochlear damage → SNHL component ("far-advanced otosclerosis") |
| **Complications of stapedotomy** (surgical treatment complications) | SNHL (< 1% — most feared; inner ear trauma during footplate manipulation), perilymph fistula → vertigo, tinnitus worsening, prosthesis displacement, reparative granuloma, taste disturbance (chorda tympani injury during surgical approach) |

---

### 10. Complications of Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma)

***Acoustic neuroma (unilateral)*** [9] — ***a serious disorder not to be missed*** [9].

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Progressive SNHL** | Tumour compresses cochlear fibres of CN VIII → progressive neural hearing loss with disproportionately poor speech discrimination |
| **Vestibular dysfunction** | Vestibular fibres gradually compressed → chronic imbalance (NOT typically acute vertigo — the slow growth allows central compensation) [13] |
| **CN V involvement** | Large tumours in the CPA compress the trigeminal nerve → ***facial numbness, hyperesthesia, pain*** [13]; absent corneal reflex (ophthalmic division) |
| **CN VII involvement** | Despite CN VII being directly stretched over the tumour surface, ***facial nerve involvement is rare*** due to the nerve's resilience — ***facial nerve bundle is thick and resilient, usually only stretched over the slowly growing tumour*** [13]. Palsy occurs mainly after surgical removal, not from the tumour itself |
| **Brainstem compression** | Very large tumours (> 3–4 cm) compress the pons and cerebellum → ataxia, long tract signs (hemiparesis), hydrocephalus (compression of 4th ventricle → obstructive hydrocephalus) |
| **Hydrocephalus** | As above — obstruction of CSF flow at the 4th ventricle → ↑ICP → headache, papilloedema, N/V, CN VI palsy (false localising sign) |
| **Post-surgical complications** | CN VII injury (most common and most feared surgical complication — CN VII is draped over the tumour and must be carefully dissected off), CSF leak, meningitis, SNHL (if not already present) |

---

### 11. Complications of Temporal Bone Fracture

Temporal bone fractures are relevant because they can produce sudden otalgia, hearing loss, and multiple cranial neuropathies simultaneously.

| Fracture Type | Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Longitudinal** (~80%) | Conductive hearing loss (ossicular disruption, haemotympanum); EAC laceration with bleeding; CN VII palsy (~10–20%, usually delayed and incomplete → oedema/contusion of nerve, not transection); TM perforation; CSF otorrhoea (if dura torn) | Fracture runs along the long axis of the petrous bone → through EAC and middle ear, usually sparing the otic capsule |
| **Transverse** (~20%) | **Sensorineural hearing loss** (often profound and permanent); **severe vertigo** (labyrinthine damage); **CN VII palsy** (~50%, often immediate and complete → transection of the nerve in the labyrinthine segment); CSF otorrhoea/rhinorrhoea | Fracture runs perpendicular to the petrous axis → through the otic capsule (cochlea + vestibule) and internal auditory canal → devastating inner ear and neural damage [12] |
| **Both types** | ***CSF leakage + meningitis*** [12]; ***CN palsy*** [12]; ***traumatic aneurysm*** [12]; ***traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF)*** [12] | Basal skull fracture complications from damage to structures at the skull base |

---

### 12. Complications of NPC (relevant to ear presentations)

Since NPC commonly presents with ear symptoms in Hong Kong [2]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Persistent conductive hearing loss** | Eustachian tube obstruction → chronic OME → conductive hearing loss; may not resolve until tumour is treated |
| **Cranial nerve palsies (III–XII)** | Local invasion into the skull base, cavernous sinus, jugular foramen → sequential CN involvement; CN V (numbness), CN VI (diplopia), CN IX–XII (lower CN palsy syndrome) |
| **Distant metastases** | NPC has a high propensity for early metastasis; ***common sites: bone (75%), liver, lung, distant lymph nodes*** [2] |
| **Treatment-related complications** (radiotherapy) | Xerostomia (salivary gland damage), osteoradionecrosis of mandible/skull base, radiation-induced SNHL (cochlear damage), trismus (fibrosis of pterygoid muscles), hypothyroidism (thyroid in radiation field), second malignancy |

---

### 13. Summary Table — Complications by Condition

| Condition | Key Complications | Most Feared |
|---|---|---|
| **OE** | Chronic OE, EAC stenosis, perichondritis | Necrotising OE → skull base osteomyelitis → CN palsies → death |
| **AOM** | TM perforation, mastoiditis, labyrinthitis | Intracranial: meningitis, brain abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis |
| **CSOM/Cholesteatoma** | CHL (ossicular erosion), facial palsy, labyrinthine fistula | Intracranial complications; cholesteatoma = relentless bone erosion |
| **Ramsay Hunt** | Permanent facial palsy, SNHL, PHN | Poor facial nerve recovery (~50–70%); corneal complications |
| **Hearing loss** | Speech delay (children), cognitive decline (elderly), social isolation, tinnitus | Dementia (mid-life hearing loss = largest modifiable risk factor) |
| **Ménière's** | Progressive SNHL, drop attacks, bilateral disease, psychological impact | Tumarkin's crises (sudden falls) |
| **Acoustic neuroma** | Progressive SNHL, CN V involvement, brainstem compression, hydrocephalus | Post-surgical CN VII injury |
| **Temporal bone fracture** | CHL or SNHL, CN VII palsy, CSF leak, meningitis | Transverse: permanent profound SNHL + immediate CN VII transection |
| **NPC** | CHL from OME, CN palsies, distant metastases, treatment toxicity | Late presentation → advanced stage at diagnosis |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Intracranial complications of middle ear disease** spread via: (a) tegmen tympani → middle cranial fossa (temporal lobe abscess, epidural abscess, meningitis), (b) sigmoid sinus plate → posterior fossa (cerebellar abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis), (c) labyrinthine windows → meningitis via cochlear aqueduct.

2. **Cholesteatoma** erodes everything: ossicles (CHL) → lateral SCC (vertigo, fistula sign) → facial nerve canal (CN VII palsy) → tegmen (intracranial complications). **Surgery is mandatory** — there is no medical cure [1].

3. **Necrotising OE complications** escalate by anatomical proximity: CN VII first (stylomastoid foramen) → CN IX, X, XI (jugular foramen) → CN XII (hypoglossal canal). Multiple CN palsies = very poor prognosis.

4. **Gradenigo syndrome** (petrous apicitis): retro-orbital pain (CN V1) + CN VI palsy (abduction deficit) + otorrhoea. Classic triad for exams.

5. **Ramsay Hunt** has worse facial nerve prognosis than Bell's palsy (~50–70% vs ~85–95% complete recovery) because VZV causes axonal degeneration, not just conduction block.

6. **Hearing loss complications beyond the ear**: speech/language delay in children (intervene by 6 months), cognitive decline and dementia in elderly (largest modifiable risk factor per Lancet Commission 2024), social isolation, depression, safety hazards.

7. **Temporal bone fractures**: longitudinal → CHL, delayed CN VII palsy; transverse → SNHL, immediate CN VII palsy, severe vertigo. CSF otorrhoea in both → meningitis risk [12].

8. **Acoustic neuroma**: CN VII is usually spared by the tumour itself (nerve is resilient and slowly stretched) but is at high risk during surgical removal [13].
