## Differential Diagnosis of Numbness and Tingling

The differential diagnosis of numbness and tingling is vast because sensory disturbance can originate from a lesion at **any level** of the somatosensory pathway — from the peripheral receptor all the way to the parietal cortex. The clinical approach, therefore, is not to memorise an endless list, but to **use the pattern of sensory loss to localise the lesion first**, and then generate a focused differential based on that localisation.

Think of it as a two-step process:
1. **Where** is the lesion? (anatomical diagnosis — pattern recognition)
2. **What** is the lesion? (pathological diagnosis — informed by tempo, risk factors, associated features)

This is the fundamental principle of neurological diagnosis [2][3].

### The Murtagh Framework — Structured Differential

The lecture slides organise the differential by **clinical probability**, which is the approach you should use in the exam and on the ward [4]:

#### ***Probability Diagnosis*** (common, think of first) [4]
| Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Numbness/Tingling |
|---|---|---|
| ***Diabetic peripheral neuropathy*** | Bilateral, symmetric, glove-and-stocking; chronic/insidious; known DM or undiagnosed DM discovered on screening | Hyperglycaemia → polyol pathway/AGEs/microvascular disease → length-dependent axonal degeneration, longest fibres first [5] |
| ***Nutritional peripheral neuropathy esp. alcohol, B12, folate*** | Glove-and-stocking; history of alcohol excess, poor diet, vegetarian/vegan, gastrectomy; may have macrocytic anaemia, glossitis | Alcohol = direct neurotoxicity + thiamine/B12 malabsorption; B12 = ↓methylation of myelin proteins → demyelination of peripheral nerves ± spinal cord (subacute combined degeneration) [7] |
| ***Hyperventilation with anxiety*** | Perioral + acral (fingertips); episodic; clear anxiety/stress trigger; often young patient; associated sighing, chest tightness, light-headedness | Respiratory alkalosis → ↓ionised Ca²⁺ → neuronal hyperexcitability → spontaneous depolarisation of sensory nerves [4][14] |
| ***Nerve root pressure e.g. sciatica, cervical spondylosis*** | Dermatomal distribution; associated radicular pain; aggravated by Valsalva/neck movements; ± weakness/hyporeflexia in the myotome | Mechanical compression of nerve root → focal demyelination and axonal injury → both positive (tingling, pain) and negative (numbness) symptoms in that dermatome [6][13] |
| ***Nerve entrapment esp. carpal tunnel syndrome*** | Single nerve territory (e.g., lateral 3.5 digits for CTS); nocturnal symptoms; specific provocative tests positive (Phalen's, Tinel's); risk factors (female, DM, hypothyroid, pregnancy, RA) | ↑Pressure in confined anatomical space → focal compression of nerve → demyelination (early, reversible) → axonal loss (late, irreversible) [6][9] |
| ***Neurotoxic drugs*** | Glove-and-stocking; temporal relationship to drug initiation/dose escalation; improves with drug withdrawal | Direct axonal toxicity or impairment of mitochondrial function/axonal transport; majority are distal axonopathies [4][12] |

<Callout title="Exam Tip — The 'Big 6' Probability Diagnoses">
If you're asked "What are the common causes of numbness/tingling?" in an exam, these six are the answer. In Hong Kong, ***diabetic neuropathy*** is by far the most common, followed by ***CTS***, ***cervical spondylosis***, and ***drug-induced neuropathy*** (especially in oncology patients on chemotherapy). ***Hyperventilation*** is the most common cause of acute episodic perioral paraesthesia in the Emergency Department.
</Callout>

#### ***Serious Disorders Not to Be Missed*** [4]

These are the "can't-miss" diagnoses — conditions where delayed diagnosis leads to permanent disability or death:

| Category | Diagnosis | Distinguishing Features | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Vascular*** | ***CVA/TIA*** | Sudden onset (seconds–minutes); **typically negative rather than positive** [2][3]; hemibody or focal distribution following vascular territory; associated motor deficit, dysphasia, visual loss | Acute ischaemia or haemorrhage → neuronal death in somatosensory cortex, thalamus, or brainstem → sudden contralateral sensory loss |
| | ***Peripheral vascular disease*** | Unilateral limb; associated with rest pain, claudication, colour/temperature changes, absent pulses; risk factors (smoking, DM, HTN) | Chronic ischaemia of vasa nervorum → nerve ischaemia; in acute limb ischaemia, paraesthesia is among the earliest of the 6Ps (nerves > muscles > skin > bone sensitivity to ischaemia) [10] |
| ***Infection*** | ***AIDS*** | Risk factors for HIV; may have constitutional symptoms; distal symmetric polyneuropathy | Direct HIV neurotoxicity + antiretroviral drug toxicity → distal axonal degeneration |
| | ***Lyme disease*** | Travel to endemic areas; tick bite history; erythema migrans rash; cranial neuropathy (especially facial nerve) | Borrelia burgdorferi → immune-mediated radiculitis, cranial neuritis, peripheral neuropathy |
| | ***Leprosy*** | Travel/residence in endemic areas; thickened palpable nerves; anaesthetic skin patches; skin lesions | Mycobacterium leprae has tropism for Schwann cells → granulomatous inflammation of peripheral nerves → patchy sensory loss |
| | ***Some viral infections*** | Recent viral illness; may be post-infectious (GBS-like) | Post-infectious molecular mimicry or direct viral neurotropism |
| ***Tumour/cancer*** | ***Disseminated malignancy*** | Weight loss, anorexia, known malignancy history; may have paraneoplastic syndrome | Paraneoplastic neuropathy (anti-Hu, anti-CV2 antibodies → immune attack on DRG); direct nerve infiltration; or compression by metastatic disease |
| | ***Cerebral/spinal cord tumours*** | Progressive; focal neurological signs; headache/raised ICP features; spinal cord lesion → sensory level | Mass effect compressing neural pathways; or infiltration destroying sensory neurones |
| ***Other*** | ***CKF: uraemia*** | Known CKD; elevated creatinine/urea; glove-and-stocking neuropathy; ± other uraemic symptoms (fatigue, pruritus, nausea) | Accumulation of uraemic "middle molecules" → axonal degeneration; improves with dialysis [8] |
| | ***Guillain-Barré syndrome*** | Acute onset (days); ascending weakness predominates but paraesthesia often precedes; areflexia; may rapidly progress to respiratory failure; preceding infection (Campylobacter, CMV) | Post-infectious molecular mimicry → autoimmune attack on peripheral nerve myelin → acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy → conduction block |
| | ***Trauma to spinal cord*** | Clear history of trauma; sensory level on trunk; UMN signs below level | Direct mechanical disruption of ascending sensory tracts |
| | ***Marine fish toxins e.g. toadfish, Ciguatera*** | Recent ingestion of reef fish (relevant in HK); perioral/extremity paraesthesia; pathognomonic reversal of hot/cold sensation | Ciguatoxin activates voltage-gated Na⁺ channels at resting potential → persistent neuronal depolarisation → paraesthesia; cold allodynia due to preferential effect on thermosensitive fibres |

<Callout title="Red Flag — Acute Limb Ischaemia" type="error">
In the context of unilateral limb numbness/tingling, **always assess the peripheral pulses**. Acute limb ischaemia presents with ***paraesthesia*** as one of the **earliest** symptoms because nerves are the most metabolically sensitive tissue (sensitivity to ischaemia: ***nerves > muscles > skin > bone***) [10]. Missing this diagnosis can lead to limb loss within 6 hours. The 6Ps mnemonic: ***Pain, Paraesthesia, Pallor, Pulselessness, Perishingly cold, Paralysis*** [10].
</Callout>

#### ***Pitfalls (Often Missed)*** [4]

These are the conditions that frequently catch clinicians off-guard:

| Diagnosis | Why It's Missed | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Migraine variant with focal signs*** | Paraesthesia without headache confuses clinicians; may mimic TIA | **Spreading tingling or paraesthesia followed by numbness, evolving over 20–30 min over one half of body** [2][3]; slow "march" of symptoms across body parts (due to cortical spreading depression — a wave of depolarisation sweeping across cortex); may occur without headache in older patients (up to 42%) [3][11] |
| ***Multiple sclerosis/transverse myelitis*** | Young patient; initial episode may be subtle; episodic nature confuses | **Ascending from one or both lower limbs to a distinct level on trunk over hours to days** [2][3]; may have Lhermitte's sign; optic neuritis (40–70% have paraesthesia as associated symptom) [15]; relapsing-remitting course; Uhthoff's phenomenon (heat worsens symptoms) |
| ***Hypocalcaemia*** | Attributed to "just anxiety" when it's actually a metabolic problem | Perioral + acral paraesthesia; may have Trousseau's sign (carpal spasm with BP cuff inflation) and Chvostek's sign (facial twitching on tapping parotid); causes include hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, post-thyroidectomy, pancreatitis |
| ***Chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy (CIDP)*** | Slowly progressive; confused with other chronic neuropathies | Progressive or relapsing-remitting weakness + sensory loss > 8 weeks; proximal and distal; areflexia; elevated CSF protein; demyelinating pattern on NCS |
| ***Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome*** | Slowly progressive since childhood; patient may not present until adulthood | Pes cavus, hammer toes, "inverted champagne bottle" legs, high-stepping gait; family history; very slowly progressive |
| ***Amyloidosis*** | Rare; not considered in differential | Painful small-fibre neuropathy (burning dysaesthesia); may have systemic features (macroglossia, periorbital purpura, nephrotic syndrome, cardiomyopathy) |
| ***Heavy metal toxicity e.g. lead*** | Occupational exposure not asked about | Lead → predominantly motor neuropathy (wrist drop/foot drop) but can have sensory symptoms; arsenic/thallium → painful sensory neuropathy with GI symptoms |

<Callout title="Migraine Aura vs Stroke/TIA — How to Distinguish" type="idea">
This is a classic exam question. The key difference is **tempo of onset**:
- ***Migraine aura***: **positive symptoms (tingling) spread slowly over 20–30 minutes**, often "marching" from one body part to another (e.g., hand → arm → face). This reflects the slow propagation of cortical spreading depression across the somatosensory cortex (~3 mm/min). Positive symptoms (tingling) typically precede negative symptoms (numbness) [2][3].
- ***Stroke/TIA***: **occurs more rapidly** (seconds to minutes, maximal at onset); **typically negative rather than positive** (numbness rather than tingling) [2][3]. Follows a vascular territory.
</Callout>

#### ***Masquerades Checklist*** [4]

These are common conditions that "masquerade" as other diagnoses — always screen for them:

| Masquerade | How It Causes Numbness/Tingling | How to Screen |
|---|---|---|
| ***Diabetes*** | Peripheral neuropathy (most common cause of chronic paraesthesia) | Blood sugar, HbA1c, urinalysis |
| ***Drugs e.g. cytotoxic agents, interferon*** | Direct neurotoxicity → axonal degeneration | Detailed drug history (including OTC, herbal, alcohol) [4] |
| ***Anaemia: pernicious anaemia*** | B12 deficiency → demyelination of peripheral nerves + dorsal columns/CST (subacute combined degeneration) [7] | FBE (macrocytic anaemia), serum B12, anti-IF antibodies |
| ***Thyroid/other endocrine: hypothyroid?*** | Myxoedematous infiltration of peripheral nerves; also predisposes to CTS | TFTs |
| ***Spinal dysfunction*** | Radiculopathy or myelopathy from spondylosis, disc herniation, or spinal stenosis | Spinal examination, MRI spine |

#### ***Psychogenic / Functional*** [4]

- ***Consider conversion reaction (hysteria), severe anxiety disorder. Some cases may be idiopathic.*** [4]
- **Key feature**: ***bizarre distribution, not conforming to known anatomical pattern*** [2][3] — e.g., exact midline split of sensation (anatomically impossible because of overlapping dermatomal innervation), or numbness that ends precisely at the shoulder joint rather than following a nerve/dermatome
- Positive neurological signs are absent; investigations are normal
- Diagnosis of exclusion — but important to recognise to avoid unnecessary invasive investigations

### Differential by Distribution Pattern — A Practical Localisation Framework

This is the most clinically useful way to generate a focused differential [2][3][6]:

| Distribution | Localisation | Top Differentials |
|---|---|---|
| **Glove-and-stocking** (bilateral, symmetric, distal > proximal) | Peripheral polyneuropathy | DM, alcohol, B12/folate, drugs, uraemia, hypothyroid, CIDP, CMT, amyloidosis |
| **Single peripheral nerve territory** | Mononeuropathy | CTS (median), cubital tunnel (ulnar), meralgia paraesthetica (LFCN), peroneal palsy |
| **Multiple individual nerve territories** (asymmetric) | Mononeuritis multiplex | Vasculitis (PAN, RA, SLE), DM (diabetic amyotrophy), sarcoidosis, leprosy |
| **Dermatomal** | Radiculopathy | Cervical/lumbar disc herniation, spondylosis, herpes zoster, tumour, infection |
| **Bilateral dermatomal with sensory level** | Spinal cord lesion | MS/transverse myelitis, cervical myelopathy, tumour, B12 deficiency (SCD), trauma, epidural abscess |
| **Unilateral hemibody** | Contralateral thalamus or cortex | Stroke/TIA, tumour, migraine aura, MS plaque |
| **Crossed** (ipsilateral face + contralateral body) | Brainstem (lateral medullary) | Stroke (Wallenberg syndrome), tumour, demyelination |
| **Perioral + acral** (bilateral fingertips) | Metabolic / systemic | Hypocalcaemia, hyperventilation, hypoglycaemia [5] |
| **Non-anatomical / bizarre** | Functional / psychogenic | Conversion disorder, anxiety; diagnosis of exclusion [2][3][4] |

### Differential by Temporal Profile

The **speed of onset** dramatically narrows the differential [2][3]:

### Differential Diagnosis of Specific High-Yield Presentations

#### 1. Numbness/Tingling in the Hand

This is an extremely common clinical scenario. The differential depends on which part of the hand is affected:

| Distribution | Likely Nerve/Level | Top Differentials |
|---|---|---|
| **Lateral 3.5 digits** (palmar), thenar wasting | Median nerve at wrist | ***CTS*** [4][9] |
| **Medial 1.5 digits**, intrinsic muscle wasting | Ulnar nerve at elbow or wrist | Cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome [9] |
| **All digits** + forearm + neck pain aggravated by neck movement | Cervical nerve root | Cervical radiculopathy (C6/C7) [13] |
| **All digits bilaterally**, glove distribution | Polyneuropathy | DM, B12, drugs, alcohol |
| **Whole hand** + UMN signs in legs | Cervical spinal cord | Cervical myelopathy [6] |
| **Medial forearm + medial 1.5 digits** + lower trunk weakness | Lower brachial plexus (C8-T1) | ***Thoracic outlet syndrome (neurological type)*** [6]; Pancoast tumour |

The DDx for CTS specifically includes [9]:
- **Cervical spondylosis (esp. C6/7)**: neck pain, symptoms exacerbated by neck movement (not wrist position)
- **Pronator teres syndrome**: forearm motor involvement, palmar sensation affected (palmar cutaneous branch involved — unlike CTS where it is spared because it branches proximal to the retinaculum)
- **Thoracic outlet syndrome**: lower trunk distribution (C8-T1), not pure median territory
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: bilateral and symmetric, not confined to median nerve territory

#### 2. Numbness/Tingling in the Leg

| Distribution | Localisation | Top Differentials |
|---|---|---|
| **Lateral thigh** only | Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve | Meralgia paraesthetica (compression under inguinal ligament — obesity, pregnancy, tight clothing) |
| **Posterior leg to foot** + back pain | L5-S1 nerve root | Sciatica (disc herniation) [4][9] |
| **Lateral leg + dorsum of foot** + foot drop | Common peroneal nerve | Peroneal nerve palsy (compression at fibular head — leg crossing, plaster cast, weight loss) |
| **Both feet**, stocking distribution | Polyneuropathy | DM, alcohol, B12, drugs, uraemia |
| **Both legs** with sensory level on trunk | Spinal cord | MS, transverse myelitis, cord compression (tumour, epidural abscess), B12 deficiency |
| **Bilateral saddle area** + bladder/bowel dysfunction | Cauda equina (below L2) | Disc herniation (L4/5, L5/S1), tumour, infection — ***SURGICAL EMERGENCY*** [6] |

#### 3. Numbness/Tingling in the Face

| Distribution | Localisation | Top Differentials |
|---|---|---|
| **Unilateral face** (trigeminal distribution) | Trigeminal nerve or nucleus | Trigeminal neuropathy (tumour, MS plaque in pons, herpes zoster) |
| **Perioral** (bilateral) | Metabolic | Hypocalcaemia, hyperventilation, hypoglycaemia [4][5] |
| **Unilateral face + contralateral body** | Lateral medulla (Wallenberg) | Posterior circulation stroke [2][3] |
| **Unilateral face + ipsilateral body** | Contralateral pons or above | Pontine/thalamic/cortical stroke [2][3] |

### Integration: Key Differentiating Features Between Major Diagnoses

| Feature | Peripheral Neuropathy | Radiculopathy | Myelopathy | Stroke/TIA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Distribution** | Glove-and-stocking | Dermatomal | Sensory level on trunk | Vascular territory (hemibody) |
| **Onset** | Gradual (weeks–months) | Subacute (days–weeks) | Variable | Sudden (sec–min) |
| **Motor signs** | LMN (distal weakness, wasting) | LMN (segmental) | UMN below level, LMN at level | UMN (contralateral) |
| **Reflexes** | ↓ or absent (esp ankle jerk) | ↓ in affected segment | ↑ below level, ↓ at level | ↑ (contralateral) |
| **Positive vs negative** | Both (burning + numbness) | Both (pain + numbness) | Usually negative | **Typically negative** [2][3] |
| **Bladder/bowel** | Late/absent | Only if cauda equina | Common | Only if bilateral/brainstem |

<Callout title="Critical Rule" type="error">
**Never** attribute numbness/tingling to a psychogenic cause until you have excluded organic disease. ***Psychogenic sensory loss is bizarre and does not conform to known anatomical patterns*** [2][3] — but so can some real neurological conditions (e.g., non-length-dependent small fibre neuropathy, MS plaques). Always complete the diagnostic workup before labelling a patient as "functional."

### The Role of Characteristic Temporal Patterns in Narrowing the Differential [2][3]

This summary from the senior notes is extremely high yield:

| Temporal Pattern | Likely Diagnosis | Pathophysiological Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Spreading tingling/paraesthesia followed by numbness, evolving over 20–30 min over one half of body*** | **Migraine aura** | Cortical spreading depression (CSD): a wave of neuronal depolarisation followed by suppression propagates across the cortex at ~3 mm/min; the slow "march" produces the characteristic gradual spread [2][3][11] |
| ***Rapid onset (seconds–minutes), typically negative*** | **Stroke or TIA** | Sudden vascular occlusion → immediate neuronal ischaemia → acute loss of function; negative because neurones are dying/non-functioning, not irritated [2][3] |
| ***Ascending from one or both lower limbs to a distinct level on trunk over hours to days*** | **Inflammatory cord lesion** (transverse myelitis, MS) | Inflammatory demyelination spreads within the spinal cord; the ascending pattern reflects progressive involvement of adjacent tracts over time [2][3] |
| ***Bizarre, not conforming to known anatomical pattern*** | **Psychogenic** (functional neurological disorder) | No structural lesion; the distribution does not map onto any dermatome, peripheral nerve, or CNS pathway [2][3] |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis">

1. **Localise first, then differentiate**: distribution pattern is the single most powerful tool — glove-and-stocking (polyneuropathy), dermatomal (radiculopathy), sensory level (cord), hemibody (central), perioral + acral (metabolic), non-anatomical (functional)
2. **Tempo matters**: sudden = vascular (stroke/TIA); slow march over 20–30 min = migraine; ascending over hours–days = cord inflammation; chronic progressive = metabolic/toxic neuropathy
3. ***Probability diagnoses***: DM neuropathy, nutritional (alcohol/B12/folate), hyperventilation, nerve root pressure, CTS, neurotoxic drugs
4. ***Must not miss***: CVA/TIA, PVD/acute limb ischaemia, GBS (can kill via respiratory failure), spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome (surgical emergency), infections (HIV, Lyme)
5. ***Often missed***: migraine with aura, MS/transverse myelitis, hypocalcaemia, CIDP
6. **Stroke vs migraine**: stroke is rapid and typically negative; migraine aura spreads slowly over 20–30 min with positive symptoms preceding negative
7. ***Always take a drug history*** — neurotoxic drugs are common and reversible
8. ***Always check peripheral pulses*** — acute limb ischaemia presents with paraesthesia as the earliest symptom (nerves most sensitive to ischaemia)
