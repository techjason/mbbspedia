## Management Principles

The management of numbness and tingling is **cause-directed** — there is no single "treatment for numbness." The overarching principle is: **identify the underlying cause, treat it, and manage the symptomatic neuropathic pain if present**. This makes the diagnosis (covered in previous sections) the most critical step.

Let me organise this the way a senior clinician would think on a ward round: first deal with emergencies, then address the common causes systematically, and finally tackle symptom management.

## Emergency Management

These are the time-critical conditions where delayed treatment causes irreversible harm. You must recognise and act fast.

### 1. Acute Limb Ischaemia

When a patient presents with unilateral limb numbness/tingling with absent pulses and the 6Ps, this is a **limb-threatening emergency** [10]:

- **Immediate**: IV heparin bolus (5000 IU) then infusion — prevents thrombus propagation. *Why heparin first?* The clot is already there; heparin won't dissolve it but will stop it getting bigger while you organise definitive treatment.
- **Definitive treatment** (must be within 6 hours — after 6h, ischaemia becomes irreversible) [10]:
  - **Embolectomy** (Fogarty balloon catheter): for embolic causes
  - **Catheter-directed thrombolysis** (tPA/urokinase infused directly into thrombus): for thrombotic causes or distal emboli
  - **Surgical bypass/revascularisation**: if thrombosis in situ on a background of chronic atherosclerotic disease
- **Post-revascularisation considerations**:
  - **Compartment syndrome**: after prolonged ischaemia (≥ 6h) + revascularisation → reperfusion injury → oedema → ↑compartment pressure → secondary ischaemia. Management: **emergent fasciotomy** when compartment pressure ≥ 30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic BP. Consider prophylactic fasciotomy in theatre if prolonged ischaemia [10]
  - **Rhabdomyolysis**: reperfusion releases K⁺, lactic acid, myoglobin, CK → **acute renal failure, arrhythmia, ARDS**. Management: aggressive IV hydration ± IV sodium bicarbonate (↓acidosis, ↓myoglobin cast formation) ± dialysis [10]
- **Contraindications to thrombolysis** [10]: ***recent stroke, bleeding tendency, ICH/brain tumour, recent head trauma***
- **Non-viable limb** (non-blanchable mottling, dead muscle): **amputation required** — reperfusion of dead muscle releases toxic metabolites → systemic effect including cardiac arrest [10]

### 2. Acute Stroke / TIA

Covered in detail in stroke management, but key points relevant to numbness/tingling [3][23]:

- **CT brain** (non-contrast) immediately to exclude haemorrhage
- **IV thrombolysis** (alteplase): within **< 3–4.5h** of symptom onset, if no contraindications
- **Mechanical thrombectomy**: within **< 6h** for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion
- **Aspirin 300 mg** once haemorrhage excluded (started after 24h if thrombolysis given)
- **Secondary prevention**: antiplatelet ± anticoagulation (if AF), statin, BP control

### 3. Cauda Equina Syndrome

- **Bilateral saddle anaesthesia + painless urinary retention ± faecal incontinence** = cauda equina [6]
- **Urgent MRI whole spine**
- **High-dose IV steroids** (dexamethasone) to reduce localised swelling
- **Surgical decompression within < 48 hours** (laminectomy/discectomy) — delay beyond this leads to permanent neurological deficit [6]

### 4. Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS)

- **Monitor**: respiratory function (FVC, ABG), autonomic function (BP, ECG), bulbar function [17]
- **Intubation and mechanical ventilation** if: FVC < 15 mL/kg body weight, ↑CO₂/↓O₂, inefficient cough, dysphagia, atelectasis [17]
- **Specific immunotherapy** (for moderately severe or progressive disease) [17]:
  - ***Plasma exchange***: plasmapheresis 50 mL/kg/session for 5 exchanges over 2 weeks — physically removes the circulating autoantibodies attacking peripheral nerve myelin
  - ***High-dose IVIg***: 0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days — modulates the immune response through multiple mechanisms (anti-idiotype antibodies, complement inhibition, Fc receptor blockade)
  - **Important**: ***combination of plasmapheresis + IVIg or steroids has no benefit over either alone*** [17]. Steroids alone are NOT effective in GBS.
- **General supportive care**: DVT prophylaxis, nutritional support, pain management [17]

<Callout title="GBS: Steroids Don't Work" type="error">
Unlike most other autoimmune/inflammatory neurological conditions, **corticosteroids are NOT beneficial in GBS** and should not be used as primary treatment. This is a common exam pitfall. The immunotherapy options are **plasma exchange** or **IVIg** — not steroids [17].
</Callout>

### 5. Spinal Cord Compression

- **Urgent MRI whole spine**
- **IV dexamethasone** (reduces vasogenic oedema around the compressing lesion — buys time)
- **Definitive**: surgical decompression (for extradural tumour, epidural abscess, disc) or **radiotherapy** (for radiosensitive tumours, e.g., lymphoma, myeloma)

---

## Cause-Directed Management of Common Conditions

### A. Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy

This is the ***most common cause*** [4] and warrants the most detailed discussion:

**Principles**: The cornerstone is **glycaemic control** — this is both preventative and therapeutic. There is no drug that reverses established diabetic neuropathy; you can only slow progression and manage symptoms.

| Strategy | Details | Mechanism / Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Glycaemic control** | Target HbA1c < 7% (individualise for elderly/comorbid); prefer ***SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists*** [5] | Every 1% ↑HbA1c → 26% ↑risk of PAD. Tight control ↓microvascular complications (UKPDS, DCCT trials). SGLT2i and GLP1a have additional cardiovascular and renal benefits |
| **CVD risk factor control** | BP control (target < 130/80), lipid control (statin), smoking cessation | Diabetic neuropathy shares risk factors with macrovascular disease; vasa nervorum ischaemia contributes to neuropathy |
| **Foot care** | Daily inspection, appropriate footwear, podiatry, annual monofilament testing | Loss of protective sensation → unnoticed injuries → ulceration → Charcot joint → amputation. Prevention is everything |
| **Neuropathic pain Mx** | See below (gabapentin/pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline) [5] | Symptomatic — does NOT reverse the underlying neuropathy |
| **Avoid nephrotoxic OHAs** | Metformin contraindicated if eGFR < 30; dose-adjust if 30–45 | CKD progression exacerbates uraemic neuropathy on top of diabetic neuropathy |

### B. Nutritional Neuropathy — B12 and Folate Deficiency

**B12 replacement** [7]:

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Route** | ***Parenteral (IM) if impaired absorption*** (pernicious anaemia, gastrectomy, terminal ileum disease); ***oral if dietary deficiency*** (vegans) |
| **IM regimen** | 1000 μg IM weekly until normalised → then 1000 μg IM every 1–2 months |
| **Oral regimen** | 1000 μg PO daily — even in malabsorption, very high oral doses can work via non-IF-dependent passive diffusion (~1% of oral dose is absorbed passively) |
| **Duration** | ***Lifelong if underlying condition is irreversible*** (pernicious anaemia, gastrectomy); otherwise until deficiency corrected |
| **Urgency** | ***Urgent replacement indicated if severe anaemia or neuropsychiatric symptoms*** — risk of irreversible neurological deficits if delayed |
| **Monitoring** | Reticulocyte count peaks day 5–10; Hb rises ~1 g/dL/week. Watch for ↓K⁺ (rapid haematopoiesis consumes K⁺) and Fe depletion (increased erythropoiesis) |
| **Neurological recovery** | ***Sensory neuropathy takes 6–12 months to correct; some deficits may not improve*** [7]. This is why early treatment is critical |

**Folate replacement** [7]:
- **Oral**: 1–5 mg/day — sufficient even if malabsorption
- **Critical rule**: ***If B12 status is unknown, always give B12 alongside folate*** — use of folate alone in the presence of B12 deficiency may worsen neurological deficit despite partially masking haematological deficits (mechanism unclear but well-documented) [7]

<Callout title="Never Give Folate Alone Without Checking B12 Status" type="error">
This is a classic exam point and a real clinical danger. ***Folate alone in B12 deficiency may worsen neurological deficit*** while correcting the macrocytic anaemia — giving a false sense of security from the improving blood count while the spinal cord degenerates. Always check B12 before or alongside folate replacement [7].
</Callout>

**Alcoholic neuropathy**:
- **Alcohol cessation** (most important)
- **Thiamine replacement** (IV Pabrinex in acute setting, then oral thiamine)
- **B12/folate replacement** if deficient
- **Balanced nutrition**

### C. Drug-Induced Neuropathy

- ***Withdraw the offending agent*** whenever possible [4]
- **Drug list**: ***cytotoxic agents (vincristine, cisplatin, taxanes), interferon, colchicine, thalidomide, statins***, metronidazole, amiodarone, isoniazid [4]
- **Generally improves after withdrawal** of the offending agent, though recovery may take months [3]
- **Isoniazid-induced neuropathy**: prevented by co-prescribing **pyridoxine (vitamin B6)** — because isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphate, which is a cofactor in peripheral nerve function
- **If the offending drug cannot be stopped** (e.g., essential chemotherapy): dose reduction, switching to less neurotoxic agents where possible, and symptomatic neuropathic pain management

### D. Uraemic Neuropathy (CKD)

- **Treat the underlying CKD**: optimise dialysis adequacy, or **renal transplantation** (the only treatment that reliably reverses uraemic neuropathy)
- **Neuropathic pain management** as needed
- Neuropathy generally improves with adequate dialysis

### E. Hypothyroid Neuropathy

- **Thyroxine (levothyroxine) replacement**: corrects both the diffuse peripheral neuropathy and the predisposition to CTS
- Slow titration in elderly/cardiac patients

### F. Hypocalcaemia

| Acuity | Treatment | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute symptomatic** (tetany, severe paraesthesia) | IV calcium gluconate 10% (10 mL over 10 min, then infusion) | Directly raises ionised Ca²⁺ → stabilises neuronal membranes → stops spontaneous firing |
| **Chronic** | Oral calcium + vitamin D (alfacalcidol/calcitriol) | Restores calcium homeostasis |
| **Hyperventilation-induced** | Reassurance, slow breathing, rebreathing into cupped hands or paper bag | Raises pCO₂ → corrects respiratory alkalosis → ↑ionised Ca²⁺. Total calcium is normal — NO calcium replacement needed |

### G. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)

This follows a stepwise approach from conservative to surgical [9]:

| Stage | Treatment | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Conservative** (first-line for mild-moderate) | ***Night-time wrist splint*** (in neutral position) [9] | Prevents wrist flexion during sleep → ↓carpal tunnel pressure → ↓median nerve compression. The nerve recovers if compression is intermittent |
| | Physiotherapy, lifestyle modification | Activity modification (ergonomic keyboards, rest breaks), weight loss |
| **Pharmacological** | ***Local steroid injection*** (into carpal tunnel) [9] | Reduces synovial inflammation/swelling → ↓pressure on nerve. Provides temporary relief (weeks to months). Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) also used but evidence is weak |
| **Surgical** | ***Carpal tunnel release*** (division of flexor retinaculum) [9] | Definitive: opens up the tunnel by cutting the transverse carpal ligament → permanent pressure relief. Can be **open or endoscopic** |

**Surgical indications** [9]:
- CTS ***unresponsive to conservative treatment*** for 6 weeks
- Associated ***sensory / motor deficit*** (thenar wasting = late sign = urgent)
- Axonal loss on NCS (indicates irreversible nerve damage is occurring)

**Specific surgical complications** [9]:
- Persistent CTS symptoms (inadequate release)
- Nerve injury: palmar cutaneous branch of median nerve
- Vascular injury: superficial palmar arch

### H. Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (Ulnar Neuropathy at Elbow)

- **Conservative**: ***soft elbow extension splint*** (prevents prolonged elbow flexion which stretches the ulnar nerve), physiotherapy, avoid leaning on elbow [6]
- **Pharmacological**: local steroid injection, pyridoxine
- **Surgical**: decompression in situ, medial epicondylectomy, or ***anterior transposition*** of ulnar nerve [6]

### I. Cervical Radiculopathy / Spondylosis

| Severity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Mild** (pain, paraesthesia only) | Conservative: analgesia (NSAIDs, neuropathic pain agents), physiotherapy, cervical collar for acute flare, activity modification |
| **Moderate** (persistent pain despite conservative Mx) | Cervical epidural steroid injection, nerve root block |
| **Severe** (progressive motor deficit, myelopathic signs, failed conservative Mx) | Surgical decompression ± stabilisation (anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, or posterior laminectomy) [6] |

### J. Cervical Myelopathy

- **Surgical decompression and stabilisation** is the mainstay — because this is a progressive condition where the spinal cord is being mechanically compressed, and there is no effective conservative treatment once myelopathic signs are present [6]
- **Approach**: anterior (ACDF) or posterior (laminoplasty/laminectomy with fusion) depending on number of levels involved and alignment

### K. Multiple Sclerosis

- **Acute relapse** (including sensory relapse with numbness/paraesthesia): **IV methylprednisolone** (1g/day for 3–5 days) — hastens recovery but does NOT alter long-term outcome [3]
  - ***PO steroids alone are contraindicated*** for optic neuritis (shown to ↑recurrence in the ONTT trial) [15]
- **Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)**: reduce relapse frequency and MRI lesion burden
  - First-line: ***glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, IFN-β1 (Betaferon/Rebif)*** [15]
  - Escalation: fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, cladribine
- **Symptomatic**: neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin/pregabalin), physiotherapy, spasticity management

### L. NMOSD

- **Acute attacks**: IV pulse steroids, plasmapheresis, IVIg [20]
- **Prophylaxis**: immunosuppression — azathioprine, MMF, **rituximab** (anti-CD20)
- ***Do NOT use MS-specific agents*** (e.g., IFN-β, natalizumab, fingolimod) — ***may be harmful*** in NMOSD [20]

### M. Hyperventilation / Anxiety

- **Acute**: reassurance, calm environment, slow breathing instruction (breathe in for 4 seconds, hold 4 seconds, out for 6 seconds), ± rebreathing into cupped hands
- **Chronic / recurrent**: treat the underlying anxiety disorder
  - **Psychotherapy**: CBT (first-line for anxiety disorders)
  - **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, escitalopram) for generalised anxiety disorder or panic disorder [24]
  - **NOT benzodiazepines** as first-line (risk of dependence)

## Symptomatic Management of Neuropathic Pain

Many causes of numbness/tingling are associated with neuropathic pain (burning, tingling, electric-like). Even when the underlying cause is addressed, neuropathic pain often requires dedicated pharmacological management. The character of neuropathic pain is described as ***tingling, pricking, needle-like, numbness, electric-like, burning*** and it is ***less opioid-responsive*** [1].

Neuropathic pain ***responds to antidepressants and anticonvulsants*** [1]:

### Pharmacological Ladder for Neuropathic Pain

| Line | Drug Class | Examples | Mechanism | Key Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1st line** | **Gabapentinoids** | ***Gabapentin*** (300–3600 mg/day in 3 divided doses), ***Pregabalin*** (75–600 mg/day in 2 divided doses) | Bind α₂δ subunit of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels → ↓presynaptic Ca²⁺ influx → ↓excitatory neurotransmitter release (glutamate, substance P) → ↓neuronal hyperexcitability | Pregabalin has more predictable pharmacokinetics (linear absorption) than gabapentin. S/E: drowsiness, dizziness, peripheral oedema, weight gain. **Dose-reduce in renal impairment** |
| **1st line** | **SNRIs** | ***Duloxetine*** (30–120 mg/day) | Inhibits reuptake of serotonin AND noradrenaline → enhances descending inhibitory pain pathways from brainstem → ↓pain signal transmission in dorsal horn | Preferred over TCAs in elderly/cardiac patients (better S/E profile). S/E: nausea, dry mouth, constipation. C/I: hepatic impairment, concomitant MAOIs |
| **1st line** | **TCAs** | ***Amitriptyline*** (10–75 mg nocte), ***Nortriptyline*** | Inhibits reuptake of serotonin + noradrenaline (same as SNRIs) PLUS blocks Na⁺ channels and NMDA receptors → multiple analgesic mechanisms | Excellent for neuropathic pain + insomnia (sedating). Start low, go slow. S/E: anticholinergic (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision), sedation, cardiac arrhythmia. **C/I: recent MI, heart block, urinary retention, narrow-angle glaucoma** |
| **2nd line** | **Combination** | Gabapentinoid + SNRI or TCA | Synergistic — target different mechanisms | If monotherapy fails, combine drugs from different classes rather than switching between same class |
| **2nd line** | **Topical** | Capsaicin 8% patch, lidocaine 5% patch | Capsaicin depletes substance P from sensory nerve terminals; lidocaine blocks Na⁺ channels locally | For localised neuropathic pain. Few systemic S/E |
| **3rd line** | **Opioids** | ***Tramadol*** (weak opioid + SNRI-like action); strong opioids (morphine, oxycodone) as last resort | μ-opioid receptor agonism → ↓pain perception; tramadol also inhibits NA/5-HT reuptake | Use with caution — neuropathic pain is ***less opioid-responsive*** [1]. Risk of dependence. Tramadol preferred over strong opioids |
| **3rd line** | **Anticonvulsants** | ***Carbamazepine*** (specifically for trigeminal neuralgia) | Blocks voltage-gated Na⁺ channels → stabilises hyperexcitable neurones | Carbamazepine is first-line for trigeminal neuralgia specifically (not general neuropathic pain). S/E: hyponatraemia, aplastic anaemia, Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Monitor FBE and Na⁺ |

<Callout title="Why Standard Analgesics Don't Work Well for Neuropathic Pain" type="idea">
Neuropathic pain arises from **ectopic firing of damaged neurones** and **central sensitisation**, not from ongoing tissue damage. This is why:
- **Paracetamol**: works on COX in the CNS for nociceptive pain → minimal effect on ectopic neuronal firing
- **NSAIDs**: work on peripheral COX/prostaglandin pathway → irrelevant to neuropathic mechanisms
- **Opioids**: work on μ-receptors → somewhat effective but the descending inhibitory pathways are already dysfunctional in neuropathic states → ***less opioid-responsive*** [1]

Instead, gabapentinoids (↓Ca²⁺ channel activity), antidepressants (↑descending inhibition), and Na⁺ channel blockers (stabilise ectopic firing) target the actual pathophysiology.
</Callout>

### Non-Pharmacological Approaches

| Modality | Details | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Physiotherapy** | Desensitisation techniques, graded motor imagery, TENS | Moderate evidence for chronic neuropathic pain |
| **Psychological** | CBT for pain management, mindfulness-based stress reduction | Good evidence for chronic pain syndromes |
| **Neurostimulation** | Spinal cord stimulation (implanted), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) | Reserved for refractory pain; spinal cord stimulation has good evidence for FBSS, CRPS |
| **Acupuncture** | Various protocols | Limited evidence; may offer modest benefit |

| ***Cubital tunnel*** | Elbow splint → ***anterior transposition*** if failed | No |
| ***Cervical radiculopathy*** | Conservative (analgesia, physio, collar) → epidural injection → surgery if progressive | No (unless myelopathy) |
| ***Cervical myelopathy*** | Surgical decompression + stabilisation | Semi-urgent |
| ***Cauda equina*** | Urgent MRI → surgical decompression < 48h | **YES** |
| ***Acute limb ischaemia*** | Heparin → embolectomy/thrombolysis within 6h | **YES** |
| ***Stroke / TIA*** | CT → thrombolysis (< 4.5h) / thrombectomy (< 6h) → aspirin → secondary prevention | **YES** |

The immunopathology of NMOSD (anti-AQP4 antibody-mediated, complement-driven astrocyte destruction) is fundamentally different from MS (T-cell-mediated myelin attack). NMOSD prophylaxis agents: rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody targeting B cells that produce anti-AQP4), azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). These broadly suppress the humoral immune response. For acute attacks: IV pulse steroids, plasmapheresis, or IVIg."
