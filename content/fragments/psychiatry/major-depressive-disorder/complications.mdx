## Complications of Major Depressive Disorder

### Why Think About Complications?

MDD is not a "benign" mood problem. It is a systemic illness with consequences that extend far beyond sadness. The lecture slides conclude with a clear message: ***Depression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality*** [3]. Understanding complications is essential because it drives urgency of treatment, informs the consent discussion with patients ("if we don't treat this, here is what can happen"), and frames depression as a medical emergency in its most severe forms.

Complications can be organised into:
1. **Psychiatric complications** (direct consequences of the depressive illness itself)
2. **Medical/physical complications** (depression's impact on the body)
3. **Functional and psychosocial complications** (impact on life, work, relationships)
4. **Treatment-related complications** (iatrogenic)

### 1. Psychiatric Complications

#### A. Suicide — The Most Devastating Complication

This is the complication that kills. Everything you do in managing depression — every assessment, every follow-up, every medication choice — is ultimately aimed at preventing this outcome.

***Depression raises suicidal risk*** [3]:

- ***Increase in suicide risk attributable to depression was 20-fold*** [3]
- ***Suicide was the cause of death in 6% of patients with an affective disorder, and the risk would be even higher in those with psychiatric co-morbidities*** [3]
- ***In a longitudinal study in Sweden spanning over half a century, the long-term suicide risk in subjects with depression was 6.0% after 54–64 years of follow-up*** [3]
- Senior notes cite even higher figures for severe admitted cases: ***> 20× risk of suicide, can approach 15% in those with severe admitted cases*** [2]

**Why does depression cause suicide?** The pathophysiology converges from multiple directions:
- **Hopelessness** (Beck's cognitive triad: "nothing will ever get better") — the single strongest cognitive predictor of suicide
- **Impaired serotonergic function** — 5-HT deficiency reduces impulse control, making it harder to resist self-destructive urges
- **Psychomotor retardation paradox** — the most severely retarded patients may be too immobilised to act on suicidal thoughts; the danger period is when they start to improve (enough energy to act, but still deeply hopeless). This is why the early weeks of antidepressant treatment are a high-risk period
- **Psychotic features** — command hallucinations ("kill yourself"), delusions of guilt ("you deserve to die"), nihilistic delusions (Cotard's syndrome)
- **Comorbid substance abuse** — disinhibition + depression is a lethal combination

#### Hong Kong-Specific Data on Depression and Suicide

***Depression accounts for a significant proportion of suicides in adults in Hong Kong*** [3]:
- ***Using a case-control psychological autopsy method, 150 local suicide decedents aged 15–59 were compared with 150 randomly selected age- and gender-matched control participants living in the community*** [3]
- ***In the presence of non-disease-related social risk factors (unemployment and unmanageable debt), current major depressive disorder independently accounted for 27% of the population-attributable risk of suicide*** [3]

***Depression accounts for a significant proportion of suicides in older adults in Hong Kong*** [3]:
- ***Using a case-control psychological autopsy method, 70 decedents aged 60 or above who had committed suicide were compared with 100 elderly controls*** [3]
- ***86% of suicide subjects suffered from a psychiatric problem before committing suicide, compared with 9% of control subjects*** [3]
- ***Among the psychiatric problems, major depression was the commonest diagnosis*** [3]

***In some tragic cases, symptoms may be masked to others until the person is found dead by suicide*** [3]

<Callout title="Depression = Leading Cause of Suicide in HK" type="error">
In Hong Kong, MDD is the single most important psychiatric risk factor for suicide in both younger adults and the elderly. This is a high-yield exam point. Over 700,000 people commit suicide worldwide every year, and ***one of the major causes of suicide is depression*** [3]. Every depressed patient requires systematic suicide risk assessment.
</Callout>

#### B. Self-Harm (Non-Suicidal Self-Injury)

- Cutting, burning, hitting — used as maladaptive coping to regulate overwhelming emotions
- Pathophysiology: self-injury triggers endorphin release → transient relief from emotional pain. Also, physical pain can "replace" the intolerable psychological pain
- ***In some younger people, the first obvious sign may be self-injury*** [3]
- Self-harm is a risk factor for completed suicide even when intent is not to die

#### C. Substance Misuse

- Depression and substance abuse have a **bidirectional relationship**: depression drives self-medication with alcohol, cannabis, and other substances; substance use worsens depression (especially alcohol as a CNS depressant)
- ***In some younger people, the first obvious sign may be drug use in a previously stable adolescent*** [3]
- ***↑ comorbidity with other disorders, especially anxiety and substance abuse*** [2]
- Common comorbidities in youth depression: ***70% has anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance abuse, dysthymia*** [2]
- Pathophysiology: dopaminergic reward pathway dysfunction in depression → patient seeks exogenous sources of dopamine (alcohol initially increases dopamine release in nucleus accumbens; stimulants directly increase dopamine). This creates a vicious cycle: substance → transient relief → withdrawal → worse depression → more substance

#### D. Psychotic Complications

- Psychotic features develop in ~15–20% of severe depressive episodes [2]
- ***Psychotic symptoms occur in severe depression, invariably associated with loss of insight and may predict development into bipolar disorder*** [2]
- Specific psychotic complications:
  - **Cotard's syndrome** (nihilistic delusions): patient believes their organs are rotting, they are dead, the world does not exist — named after Jules Cotard (1880). This is a psychiatric emergency
  - **Depressive stupor**: ***severe psychomotor retardation progressing to point of unresponsiveness, lack of voluntary movement and near or total mutism*** [2]. This is life-threatening because the patient cannot eat, drink, or care for themselves → dehydration, malnutrition, DVT/PE from immobility
- Psychotic depression also carries higher suicide risk than non-psychotic depression (command hallucinations, delusional guilt driving self-punishment)

#### E. Chronicity and Treatment Resistance

- ***~10–20% of cases become chronic unremitting*** [2]
- ***~50% do not have complete symptom remission between episodes*** [2]
- ***Only ~25% of those with recurrent major depression achieve 5-year clinical stability with good social and occupational performance*** [2]
- Each successive episode further sensitises the brain (kindling hypothesis) — the threshold for future episodes lowers, and intervals between episodes shorten progressively [2]
- Chronicity leads to cumulative neurobiological damage: progressive hippocampal atrophy (cortisol-mediated), prefrontal cortex thinning, white matter changes

#### F. Conversion to Bipolar Disorder

- ***~25% of bipolar affective disorder first presents as a juvenile depression in their first episode*** [2]
- Psychotic features in depression may predict future bipolar conversion [2]
- This is why longitudinal follow-up and re-assessment of diagnosis is essential — a patient diagnosed with "recurrent MDD" may actually have unrecognised bipolar disorder

#### G. Comorbid Psychiatric Disorders

Depression rarely exists in isolation:
- **Anxiety disorders**: ~60–70% comorbidity rate; mutual reinforcement (worry → depression → more worry)
- **Eating disorders**: ***in some younger people, the first obvious sign may be bulimia*** [3]; depression drives disordered eating through body image distortion, comfort eating, or appetite loss
- **Personality disorders**: borderline PD and MDD frequently co-exist; borderline features predict poorer treatment response and more frequent recurrence [2]

### 2. Medical/Physical Complications

***Depression entails a non-psychiatric impact!*** [2]

#### A. Increased Non-Suicide Mortality

***Depression increases non-suicidal mortality*** [3]:
- ***Reviewed 61 reports; 72% demonstrated positive association for depression and non-suicide mortality*** [3]
- ***RR = 1.2–4.0*** [2][3]

***Possible mediators*** [3]:
1. ***Behavioural risk factors***: ***poor adherence to treatment, inactivity, ↑ alcohol consumption*** — depression impairs motivation and executive function → patients don't take their medications, don't exercise, and may drink more
2. ***Biological risk factors***: ***altered thrombogenesis*** — depression activates the sympathetic nervous system and HPA axis → ↑ platelet activation, ↑ inflammatory cytokines, ↑ endothelial dysfunction → prothrombotic state → ↑ cardiovascular events
3. ***Subclinical disease / prevalent disease***: ***cardiovascular disease*** — depression and CVD share inflammatory pathways; depression may accelerate atherosclerosis progression

#### B. Cardiovascular Disease

Depression is an **independent risk factor** for:
- **Coronary artery disease** (CAD): depressed patients have ~1.5–2× risk of developing CAD
- **Post-MI mortality**: depressed patients post-MI have 3–4× higher mortality
- **Heart failure**: depression worsens prognosis in CHF
- **Stroke**: bidirectional — depression increases stroke risk; post-stroke depression is common (~30%)

Mechanisms:
- HPA axis dysregulation → hypercortisolaemia → visceral obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia
- Sympathetic hyperactivation → ↑ heart rate, ↓ heart rate variability (HRV), ↑ arrhythmia risk
- Platelet hyperactivation → altered thrombogenesis
- Endothelial dysfunction → accelerated atherosclerosis
- Behavioural factors: smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, medication non-adherence

#### C. Metabolic Syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes

- Depression increases risk of developing type 2 diabetes by ~37% (meta-analyses)
- Bidirectional: diabetes increases depression risk; depression worsens glycaemic control
- Mechanism: cortisol excess → insulin resistance → central adiposity → metabolic syndrome. Also, anti-depressants (especially mirtazapine, TCAs, paroxetine) can cause weight gain

#### D. Impaired Immunity and Infection

- Depression → ↑ pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) + ↓ cell-mediated immunity (↓ NK cell activity, ↓ T-cell proliferation)
- Clinical consequence: ↑ susceptibility to infections, slower wound healing, poorer vaccine responses

#### E. Chronic Pain

- Depression and chronic pain share serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways (descending pain inhibitory system)
- Depression amplifies pain perception (central sensitisation); chronic pain perpetuates depression
- This bidirectional relationship creates one of the most treatment-resistant clinical scenarios

#### F. Other Physical Morbidity

- ***↑ morbidity: associated with ↓ birth weight*** [2] — maternal depression during pregnancy → cortisol crosses placenta → fetal HPA axis programming → low birth weight, preterm delivery
- ***Chronic medical illness, poor self-perceived health, functional and cognitive impairment*** [2]
- Osteoporosis: hypercortisolaemia → ↓ osteoblast activity → bone loss (depression is an under-recognised risk factor for fracture)

---

### 3. Functional and Psychosocial Complications

***When enduring, depression can result in impaired function at work, at school and in the family*** [3]

| Domain | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Occupational** | ↓ Productivity, absenteeism, job loss, unemployment | Anergia, poor concentration, psychomotor retardation → cannot perform at work. ***~$85 billion/year loss of productivity*** [2] |
| **Academic** | ***Decline in school performance*** [3], failure, dropout | Concentration impairment, amotivation, anhedonia |
| **Social** | Social withdrawal, isolation, loss of friendships | Anhedonia → loss of interest in social activities; negative cognitive style → misinterprets social cues; fatigue → avoids effort of social engagement |
| **Interpersonal** | Relationship breakdown, divorce, family conflict | Irritability, withdrawal, loss of libido, burden on partners/family. ***↑ in divorced*** (both cause and consequence) [2] |
| **Self-care** | Neglect of hygiene, nutrition, health management | Anergia, apathy, amotivation; especially in elderly → ***deterioration of cognitive functioning and self-care*** [3] |
| **Parenting** | Impaired bonding, inconsistent parenting, neglect | Maternal/paternal depression → insecure attachment in children → intergenerational transmission of vulnerability |
| **Financial** | Debt, poverty, homelessness | Job loss + impaired decision-making + potential comorbid substance abuse |
| **Legal** | In severe cases with psychotic features or comorbid substance abuse | Impaired judgement; antisocial behaviour secondary to substance misuse or irritability |

#### Youth-Specific Complications

***In some younger people, the first obvious sign may be*** [3]:
- ***Loss of interest in friends***
- ***Decline in school performance***
- ***Self-injury or bulimia or drug use in a previously stable adolescent***

In youth depression specifically [2]:
- ***Behavioural problems*** (e.g., "one case tried to steal a bus because of frustration at home, take cannabis to lift mood due to depression") [2]
- Somatic complaints (unexplained abdominal pains, headache, anorexia, enuresis) [2]
- High comorbidity rate: 70% have anxiety disorder, conduct disorder, substance abuse, or dysthymia [2]

### 4. Treatment-Related Complications (Iatrogenic)

These are complications of the treatments themselves, which must be balanced against the risks of untreated depression:

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism | Prevention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SSRIs** | ↑ Suicidal ideation in < 25 years (first 1–2 weeks) | SSRIs may initially increase energy/activation before mood improves → patient now has the energy to act on pre-existing suicidal thoughts | Close monitoring in first 2–4 weeks; start at low dose; warn patient/family |
| **SSRIs** | Serotonin syndrome (if combined with MAOIs) | Excessive synaptic 5-HT → hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, altered mental status, autonomic instability | Mandatory washout period between SSRIs and MAOIs (≥2 weeks; 5 weeks for fluoxetine) |
| **SSRIs/SNRIs** | Hyponatraemia (SIADH) | Inappropriate ADH secretion → water retention → dilutional hyponatraemia | Monitor Na especially in elderly; educate about symptoms (confusion, nausea, seizures) |
| **SSRIs** | GI bleeding | 5-HT stored in platelets; SSRIs deplete platelet 5-HT → impaired platelet aggregation | Avoid concurrent NSAIDs; consider PPI cover in high-risk patients |
| **SSRIs/SNRIs** | Sexual dysfunction | 5-HT2/3 receptor stimulation in spinal cord → inhibits sexual arousal and orgasm | Consider switching to bupropion (no sexual S/E) or mirtazapine; dose reduction |
| **SSRIs/SNRIs** | Discontinuation syndrome | Abrupt withdrawal → rebound reduction in synaptic 5-HT → dizziness, nausea, "electric shocks," irritability, insomnia | Gradual taper over ≥4 weeks (especially paroxetine, venlafaxine) |
| **TCAs** | Cardiotoxicity in overdose | Sodium channel blockade → QRS prolongation → ventricular arrhythmias → cardiac arrest | Avoid in suicidal patients; prescribe limited supply; prefer SSRIs |
| **MAOIs** | Hypertensive crisis ("cheese reaction") | Tyramine in food normally metabolised by gut MAO-A; when MAO inhibited, tyramine → NE surge → hypertensive emergency | Strict tyramine-free diet; patient education |
| **Lithium (augmentation)** | Toxicity (tremor, ataxia, confusion, seizures, renal failure); hypothyroidism; nephrogenic DI; teratogenicity | Narrow therapeutic index; accumulates in renal impairment; inhibits thyroid hormone synthesis; affects renal aquaporins; neural tube defects (Ebstein's anomaly) | Regular monitoring: plasma Li, RFT, TFT every 6 months; reliable contraception |
| **Antipsychotics (augmentation)** | Metabolic syndrome (weight gain, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance); extrapyramidal side effects; QTc prolongation | Histamine H1, 5-HT2C, muscarinic receptor blockade → appetite ↑, metabolic dysregulation; D2 blockade → EPS | Monitor weight, glucose, lipids, ECG; use metabolically favourable agents (aripiprazole) |
| **ECT** | Cognitive impairment (acute confusion, amnesia) | Seizure-induced transient neuronal disruption; bilateral > unilateral cognitive effects | Use unilateral electrode placement when possible; inform patient; usually short-lived (days) |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of MDD — Core Points:**

1. **Suicide**: 20× increased risk; 6% lifetime risk of suicide death in affective disorders (15% in severe admitted cases). MDD is the commonest psychiatric cause of suicide in HK (27% population-attributable risk in adults, commonest diagnosis in elderly suicide). 86% of elderly suicide decedents in HK had a psychiatric problem; depression was the commonest.

2. **Non-suicide mortality**: RR 1.2–4.0. Mediated by behavioural factors (non-adherence, inactivity, alcohol), biological factors (altered thrombogenesis, HPA dysregulation), and prevalent CVD.

3. **Cardiovascular disease**: Depression is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. Mechanisms: hypercortisolaemia → insulin resistance; sympathetic activation → ↓ HRV; platelet activation → thrombosis; endothelial dysfunction.

4. **Chronicity**: 10–20% chronic unremitting; 80% recur; only 25% achieve 5-year stability. Each episode lowers threshold for future episodes (kindling).

5. **Psychotic complications**: 15–20% of severe episodes. Cotard's syndrome, depressive stupor (life-threatening), command hallucinations → suicide risk.

6. **Functional impairment**: ~$85B/year productivity loss. Occupational, academic, social, interpersonal, self-care deterioration.

7. **Substance misuse**: Bidirectional relationship; very common comorbidity; worsens prognosis.

8. **Bipolar conversion**: ~25% of BAD first presents as juvenile depression.

9. **Treatment-related**: SSRIs → suicidality in youth (first weeks), serotonin syndrome, hyponatraemia; TCAs → lethal in OD; MAOIs → hypertensive crisis; lithium → toxicity, hypothyroidism.
