## Differential Diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder

### The Logic of the DDx

When a patient presents with **low mood**, your job is not simply to confirm MDD — it is to systematically consider and exclude conditions that can mimic, co-exist with, or underlie depressive symptoms. The differential spans three broad domains [2][3]:

1. **Other primary psychiatric disorders** that present with depressed mood
2. **Depression secondary to general medical conditions** (organic mood disorder)
3. **Depression secondary to substances/medications** (substance-induced depressive disorder)

The key principle: **MDD is a clinical diagnosis of inclusion (meets criteria) AND exclusion (not better explained by something else)**. The DSM-5 criteria explicitly state the episode must ***not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or to another medical condition*** and ***not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders*** [3].

---

### Systematic Differential Diagnosis

#### A. Other Primary Psychiatric Disorders

##### 1. Bipolar Affective Disorder (BAD)

This is the **single most important differential** to actively exclude in every patient presenting with depression. Why? Because treatment differs radically — antidepressant monotherapy in BAD can trigger mania or rapid cycling.

- A patient with a current depressive episode + ***≥1 previous manic/hypomanic episode*** has bipolar disorder, not MDD [2]
- ***Hypomanic episodes are often overlooked. Patients with BP II are misdiagnosed as having major depressive disorder*** [5]
- ***Misdiagnosis is especially common — among 600 patients with bipolar disorder, 69% were initially misdiagnosed and most frequently as major depression, followed by anxiety disorders, substance or alcohol use disorder*** [5]
- ***Correct diagnosis and treatment was delayed by 5–7 years on average*** [5]

**How to distinguish:**
- **Always actively ask** about past episodes of elated/irritable mood, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, pressured speech, reckless behaviour — patients rarely volunteer hypomanic symptoms because they feel good during them
- **Discerning features that favour BAD over MDD** [2]: psychotic features in depression, atypical features (hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis), early onset, many recurrent episodes, family history of BAD, post-partum onset, rapid onset/offset of episodes
- ~25% of BAD first presents as a juvenile depression [2]

<Callout title="Must-Know Exam Point" type="error">
***Hypomanic episode is often overlooked*** [5]. If you diagnose "recurrent MDD" without screening for past hypomania, you may be missing bipolar II disorder. Always ask: "Have you ever had a period of days where you felt unusually high, energetic, or irritable — where you needed less sleep but still felt full of energy?"
</Callout>

##### 2. ***Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood*** [3]

- "Adjustment" = from Latin *ad-* (to) + *justare* (to bring near) — the person is failing to adjust to a stressor
- Develops ***≤3 months of an identifiable stressor*** [2]
- **Does not meet full criteria** for a depressive episode — the symptoms are subthreshold [2]
- The emotional/behavioural response is out of proportion to the stressor OR causes significant functional impairment
- Key distinction: ***If meeting depressive episode criteria, should be regarded as having comorbid depression*** rather than adjustment disorder [2]. Adjustment disorder is a "not-otherwise-qualifying" diagnosis
- In terms of precipitating stressor, adjustment disorder is diagnosed when the stressor is **not deemed traumatic** in nature (cf. ASD/PTSD where the stressor is traumatic) [2]

##### 3. ***Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)*** [3]

- "Dys-" (Greek: bad/difficult) + "thymia" (Greek: mood/spirit) = persistently bad mood
- Persistent depressive symptoms ***NOT meeting full criteria*** for a major depressive episode, lasting ***≥2 years*** [2]
- Onset usually in early adulthood → may persist throughout life → sometimes called "depressive personality" [2]
- May have superimposed major depressive episodes = ***"double depression"*** [2]
- Key distinction from MDD: chronicity (≥2 years), subthreshold severity, lack of discrete episodes
- Note: under DSM-5-TR, persistent depressive disorder **subsumes** both chronic MDD and dysthymia

##### 4. ***Manic Episode with Irritable Mood or Mixed Episodes*** [3]

- Mania can present with **irritability** rather than elation — this can be mistaken for agitated depression
- ***Mixed features*** specifier: a depressive episode with concurrent manic/hypomanic features (e.g., racing thoughts, increased energy, decreased need for sleep during a depressive episode)
- Key distinction: look for concurrent features of elevated energy, grandiosity, pressured speech, decreased need for sleep — these do NOT occur in pure MDD

##### 5. ***Anxiety Disorders*** [3]

- Anxiety and depression have enormous overlap — ~60–70% of MDD patients have comorbid anxiety
- GAD can mimic MDD: both have insidious onset, chronic course, prominent dysphoria, somatic symptoms [2]
- **How to distinguish** [2]:
  - Content of rumination: depressive patients tend to **brood self-critically on past events**; GAD patients tend to **worry about possible future events**
  - Somatic symptoms of depression: early morning wakening, diurnal variation in mood, suicidal thoughts are uncommon in GAD
  - Both can co-exist — comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception

##### 6. Schizoaffective Disorder

- **Simultaneous** occurrence of a depressive episode and schizophrenic symptoms lasting ≥2 weeks [2]
- Delusions and hallucinations are **less mood-congruent** and **may occur outside mood episodes** (cf. severe depression with psychotic features where psychotic symptoms are mood-congruent and episode-bound) [2]
- Must have **concurrent mood + psychotic symptoms** at some point (cf. schizophrenia where mood symptoms are minimal) [2]

##### 7. ***Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder*** [3]

- Depression caused directly by the physiological effects of a substance
- Should resolve or significantly improve after substance cessation
- Key substances: alcohol (a CNS depressant), cannabis, opioid withdrawal, stimulant withdrawal (cocaine, amphetamines)
- Distinguished from MDD by temporal relationship to substance use, improvement with abstinence

##### 8. ***Mood Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition*** [3]

- The depressive syndrome is judged to be a direct pathophysiological consequence of a medical condition (not just a psychological reaction to being ill)
- See medical conditions table below

##### 9. Other Psychiatric Disorders Presenting with Low Mood

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|
| **Schizophrenia** | Negative symptoms (flat affect, avolition, alogia) can mimic depression. However, primary psychotic symptoms (bizarre delusions, thought disorder, prominent hallucinations) dominate. Mood symptoms are secondary and brief relative to psychotic illness |
| **OCD** | Ruminations in OCD are **intrusive, ego-dystonic**, and accompanied by compulsions. In depression, ruminations are **mood-congruent** (guilt, worthlessness) and not experienced as intrusive in the same way [2] |
| **PTSD/ASD** | Can present with depressed mood, anhedonia, and withdrawal. However, require a **traumatic stressor** and have characteristic re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms |
| **Personality disorders** (especially borderline) | Chronic affective instability, identity disturbance, interpersonal dysfunction. Mood shifts are rapid (hours to days), often interpersonally triggered, and lack the sustained, pervasive quality of MDD. No classic biological symptoms |
| **Somatic symptom disorder** | Somatisation is common in depression, but in somatic symptom disorder, the somatic concerns persist **outside** depressive episodes [2] |
| **Dementia** ("pseudodementia" vs true dementia) | Depression in elderly can mimic dementia with cognitive decline and self-care deterioration. ***In some older people, symptoms may mimic dementia — deterioration of cognitive functioning and self-care*** [3]. Differentiating features: more well-defined onset, patient complains/worries about memory (vs dementia patients have poor insight), gives less effort on testing ("don't know" answers vs wrong answers in dementia), language/motor skills are slow but not impaired [2] |

#### B. Depression Secondary to General Medical Conditions

This is critical because treating the underlying condition may resolve the depression. The lecture slides provide a comprehensive list [3]:

| Category | Examples | Why They Cause Depression |
|---|---|---|
| ***Neurological disorders*** | ***Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, dementia, multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, cerebrovascular disease, migraine*** [3] | Direct neuronal damage to mood-regulating circuits (frontal-subcortical pathways); dopamine depletion in Parkinson's; post-stroke depression affects ~30% (especially left frontal lesions) |
| ***Endocrine disorders*** | ***Hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, Addison disease, prolactinomas, hyperparathyroidism*** [3] | Hypothyroidism → ↓ T3/T4 → slowed metabolism and monoamine synthesis; Cushing's → cortisol excess → hippocampal neurotoxicity; Addison's → cortisol deficiency → fatigue, apathy; Hyperparathyroidism → hypercalcaemia → neuropsychiatric symptoms |
| ***Infectious diseases*** | ***Mononucleosis, HIV infection, hepatitis C infection, Lyme disease, syphilis*** [3] | Neuroinflammation, cytokine-mediated serotonin depletion (IDO pathway), direct CNS invasion (HIV, neurosyphilis) |
| ***Neoplasias*** | ***Pancreatic cancer***, ***paraneoplastic syndromes*** [3] | Pancreatic cancer is notorious for depression preceding diagnosis (possibly cytokine-mediated or paraneoplastic); any cancer causes depression via inflammation + psychological burden |
| ***Chronic diseases*** | ***Coronary artery disease, type II diabetes*** [3] | Shared inflammatory pathways; HPA axis dysregulation; behavioural factors (inactivity, poor diet) |
| ***Chronic pain and psychosomatic conditions*** | [3] | Impaired descending pain inhibitory pathways (5-HT/NE) → central sensitisation → amplified pain → depression → more pain (vicious cycle) |
| ***Sleep-related disorders*** | ***Obstructive sleep apnoea*** [3] | Chronic sleep fragmentation → daytime somnolence, fatigue, cognitive impairment mimicking depression; hypoxia may directly impair monoaminergic function |

<Callout title="Pancreatic Cancer & Depression" type="idea">
Pancreatic cancer is one of the few malignancies where depression may be the **presenting symptom** — sometimes months before the cancer is diagnosed. The mechanism is not fully understood but may involve paraneoplastic antibodies, cytokines, or disruption of the gut-brain axis. In an older patient with new-onset depression and unexplained weight loss, think about this.
</Callout>

#### C. Drug/Substance-Related Depression

***Drug-related conditions*** that can cause or mimic depression [3]:

| Category | Examples | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Antihypertensives*** | ***Reserpine, methyldopa*** [3]; beta-blockers [2] | Reserpine depletes monoamine stores (vesicular monoamine transporter inhibitor) — this is actually the historical observation that led to the monoamine hypothesis! Methyldopa inhibits DOPA decarboxylase → ↓ dopamine/NE. Beta-blockers block noradrenergic signalling |
| ***Smoking-cessation aids*** | Varenicline [3] | Partial nicotinic agonist → may affect dopaminergic reward pathways |
| ***Steroids*** | Corticosteroids [2][3] | Exogenous cortisol → HPA axis suppression, hippocampal neurotoxicity, mood lability |
| ***Sex hormones and medications that affect sex hormones*** | OCP [2], GnRH agonists, anti-androgens [3] | Hormonal fluctuations affect serotonergic and GABAergic neurotransmission |
| ***H2 blockers*** | Ranitidine, cimetidine [3] | May cross blood-brain barrier → affect histaminergic neurotransmission |
| ***Sedatives, muscle relaxants*** | Benzodiazepines [2][3] | CNS depression, GABAergic enhancement → psychomotor slowing, apathy |
| ***Appetite suppressants*** | [2][3] | May affect serotonergic/dopaminergic pathways |
| ***Chemotherapy agents*** | [3] | Cytokine release → neuroinflammation → IDO activation → serotonin depletion |
| ***Neurological drugs*** | ***L-dopa*** [2], anticonvulsants | L-dopa can paradoxically cause depression via dopamine metabolism dysregulation |
| ***Substance abuse*** | ***Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabinoids, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics*** [3] | Alcohol is a CNS depressant; stimulant withdrawal causes rebound anhedonia/fatigue (dopamine depletion); cannabis chronic use → amotivational syndrome |
| ***Others*** | ***Interferon*** [2], indomethacin, opiates [2] | Interferon-α activates IDO enzyme → shunts tryptophan to kynurenine pathway → ↓ serotonin + ↑ neurotoxic metabolites |

### Key Differentiating Principles — Summary Table

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Feature from MDD | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Bipolar disorder** | ≥1 past manic/hypomanic episode; actively ask — patients don't volunteer | Antidepressant monotherapy can trigger mania |
| **Adjustment disorder** | Subthreshold symptoms, onset ≤3 months of stressor, non-traumatic stressor | Self-limiting; usually responds to supportive therapy alone |
| **Dysthymia** | Chronic (≥2 years), subthreshold, no discrete episodes | Consider "double depression" if MDD superimposed |
| **GAD** | Future-oriented worry (vs past-oriented rumination in MDD); less biological symptoms | Often comorbid; treatment overlaps but emphasis differs |
| **Schizoaffective disorder** | Psychotic symptoms less mood-congruent, occur outside mood episodes | Requires antipsychotic ± mood stabiliser |
| **Psychotic depression** | Mood-congruent psychotic symptoms occurring ONLY during episode | Requires antidepressant + antipsychotic or ECT |
| **Organic/medical** | Temporal relationship to medical condition, abnormal investigations | Treat underlying condition |
| **Substance-induced** | Temporal relationship to substance use/withdrawal; improves with abstinence | Remove offending agent |
| **Dementia vs pseudodementia** | Depression: acute onset, complains of memory loss, "don't know" answers; Dementia: insidious, poor insight, wrong answers | Treat depression first — cognition may improve |

### Investigations to Exclude Secondary Causes

***Physical examination & investigation to rule out medical conditions that may cause depressive symptoms*** [3]:

| Investigation | What You're Looking For |
|---|---|
| ***CBP*** | Anaemia (fatigue mimicking depression), ↑MCV (alcoholism), ↑WBC (infection) |
| ***Renal function tests*** | Uraemia (can cause apathy, cognitive impairment); hypoNa (SIADH or antidepressant side effect) |
| ***Liver function tests*** | GGT ↑ (alcoholism); hepatic encephalopathy |
| ***Thyroid function tests*** | Hypothyroidism (classic organic mimic); hyperthyroidism (can cause agitation/anxiety mimicking agitated depression) |
| ***Blood glucose*** | Hypoglycaemia (episodic fatigue, anxiety); diabetes (chronic disease-associated depression) |
| ***Calcium, phosphate*** | Hyperparathyroidism → hypercalcaemia → "stones, bones, groans, and psychiatric moans" |
| ***Vitamin B12, folate*** | Deficiency causes fatigue, cognitive impairment, depression |
| ***Blood alcohol, urine drug screen*** | Substance-induced depression |
| ***HIV test*** | If indicated — HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder |
| ***Cosyntropin/ACTH stimulation test*** | ***For Addison disease*** [3] — if suspected |
| ***ECG*** | Baseline before starting certain medications (TCAs, lithium prolong QT) |
| ***EEG*** | ***For epilepsy*** [3] — if seizures suspected |
| ***CT or MRI brain*** | ***For organic brain syndrome or hypopituitarism*** [3] — if focal neurology, cognitive deficits, or atypical presentation |

<Callout title="The Minimum Bloods for Every Depressed Patient">
At a bare minimum: **CBP, R/LFT, TFT**. These are non-negotiable. Everything else is guided by clinical suspicion from history and physical examination. You cannot diagnose MDD without first ruling out thyroid disease, anaemia, and metabolic derangement.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Differential Diagnosis of MDD — Core Points:**

1. **Always screen for bipolar disorder** — ask about past mania/hypomania. 69% of BAD patients are initially misdiagnosed, most commonly as MDD. Correct diagnosis delayed 5–7 years on average.

2. **Adjustment disorder** = subthreshold symptoms, ≤3 months of non-traumatic stressor. If full MDD criteria are met, diagnose MDD (not adjustment disorder).

3. **Dysthymia** = chronic (≥2 years), subthreshold. Can have superimposed MDD ("double depression").

4. **Psychotic depression vs schizoaffective**: mood-congruent + episode-bound psychosis = psychotic MDD. Less mood-congruent + psychosis outside mood episodes = schizoaffective.

5. **Medical causes**: always exclude hypothyroidism (TFT), Cushing's/Addison's, anaemia (CBP), and substance use. Minimum bloods: CBP, R/LFT, TFT.

6. **Drug-induced depression**: beta-blockers, reserpine, methyldopa, steroids, OCP, interferon, L-dopa, benzodiazepines. Temporal relationship to drug initiation is the key clue.

7. **Pseudodementia**: depression in elderly mimicking dementia. Treat depression first — cognition may recover.
