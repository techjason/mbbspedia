## Management of Major Depressive Disorder

### Overarching Principles

Before diving into treatments, understand the framework. Management of MDD follows the **biopsychosocial model** — you never treat with drugs alone or therapy alone. Treatment is always a combination of biological, psychological, and social interventions, tailored to severity.

***Though changes in monoamines constitute only part of the aetiological picture, the monoamine systems provide the most accessible treatment avenue*** [3].

Three phases of treatment [2]:
1. **Acute treatment** — resolve the current episode (weeks to months)
2. **Continuation treatment** — prevent relapse of the same episode (6–9 months after remission)
3. **Maintenance (prophylactic) treatment** — prevent recurrence of new episodes (years, sometimes lifelong)

<Callout title="Key Concept: Relapse vs Recurrence">
**Relapse** = return of symptoms of the *same* episode (within 6–9 months of remission) — prevented by continuation treatment. **Recurrence** = a *new* episode after full recovery — prevented by maintenance treatment. This distinction matters because premature drug cessation after apparent improvement often leads to relapse (the episode never truly ended), not recurrence.

### 1. General Measures (All Severities)

These apply to **every** patient regardless of severity [2]:

- **Avoid alcohol and substance use** — alcohol is a CNS depressant that worsens depression and impairs antidepressant efficacy; cannabis worsens amotivation; stimulant withdrawal triggers rebound depression
- **Lifestyle advice on diet and sleep hygiene** — regular sleep-wake schedule (supports circadian rhythm regulation), avoid caffeine in the evening, structured daily routine
- **Encourage suitable activity** — ***physical inactivity causes social withdrawal and exacerbates depression*** [2]. Exercise increases BDNF, endorphins, and monoamine neurotransmission — it is literally a biological antidepressant

***Physical activity*** is listed as a distinct management modality [3]:
- Aerobic exercise (30 min, 3–5×/week) has evidence equivalent to mild antidepressant effect
- Mechanism: ↑ BDNF, ↑ endorphin release, ↑ serotonin/noradrenaline, ↑ hippocampal neurogenesis, normalises HPA axis
- Most useful as adjunct; insufficient alone for moderate-severe depression

---

### 2. Pharmacotherapy

#### A. When to Use Medications

***Indication: most effective in moderate-severe depression*** [2]

The natural history numbers are important to understand drug efficacy [2]:
- **20%** will recover without treatment (spontaneous remission)
- **30%** will respond to placebo (expectation + therapeutic alliance + natural course)
- **50%** will respond to antidepressants

This means the **number needed to treat (NNT)** for antidepressants vs placebo is approximately **5–7** for moderate-severe depression. For mild depression, the NNT is much higher (effect barely separates from placebo) — hence why we start with psychosocial interventions.

#### B. Choosing an Antidepressant

The approach to choosing a drug [2][3]:

> ***Discuss choice of drug with the patient***, considering: ***potential therapeutic effects, possible adverse effects, likelihood of discontinuation symptoms, likely time to respond, the role of therapeutic alliance in predicting response*** [2]

***Choice of medication determined by clinical circumstances, particularly the patient's physical comorbidity and concomitant medications*** [3]

***Marked inter-individual variation in antidepressant tolerability*** [3]

#### C. Classes of Antidepressants

| Class | Examples | Mechanism | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)*** | ***Fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, vortioxetine*** [3] | Block SERT → ↑ synaptic 5-HT | **1st line** for most patients. Best safety profile. Vortioxetine also has multimodal 5-HT receptor activity |
| ***Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)*** | ***Duloxetine, venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine*** [3] | Block SERT + NET → ↑ synaptic 5-HT and NE | Useful for depression with chronic pain (duloxetine); venlafaxine at low dose is essentially an SSRI, only becomes dual at higher doses |
| ***Non-selective Monoamine Reuptake Inhibitors (TCAs)*** | ***Amitriptyline, imipramine, nortriptyline, clomipramine, dothiepin, trimipramine, desipramine*** [3] | Block SERT + NET (+ varying degrees of DRT) | ***Older antidepressants associated with significant adverse events and drug-drug interactions*** [3]. More effective in melancholic depression but dangerous in overdose (cardiac toxicity) |
| ***Tetracyclic antidepressants*** | ***Mianserin*** [3] | α2-adrenergic antagonist → ↑ NE release; also antihistaminic | Sedating; less commonly used now |
| ***Norepinephrine and Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (NDRIs)*** | ***Bupropion*** [3] | Block NET + DRT → ↑ synaptic NE and DA | Activating; no sexual dysfunction; also used for smoking cessation. CI in seizure disorders and eating disorders |
| ***Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)*** and ***Reversible Inhibitors of MAO-A (RIMAs)*** | ***Tranylcypromine, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, selegiline*** (irreversible); ***moclobemide*** (reversible) [3] | Inhibit MAO enzyme → ↓ monoamine breakdown → ↑ synaptic 5-HT, NE, DA | Effective for atypical depression. Irreversible MAOIs require strict tyramine-free diet (risk of hypertensive crisis). Moclobemide is safer (reversible) |
| ***Melatonergic antidepressants*** | ***Agomelatine*** [3] | MT1/MT2 melatonin receptor agonist + 5-HT2C antagonist | Resynchronises circadian rhythm; few sexual side effects; requires LFT monitoring (hepatotoxicity) |
| ***Others*** | ***Trazodone, mirtazapine*** [3] | Trazodone: SARI (5-HT2 antagonist + weak SERT inhibitor); Mirtazapine: NaSSA (α2 antagonist + 5-HT2/3 antagonist + H1 antagonist) | Mirtazapine: strongly sedating (H1 blockade), appetite stimulating → useful when insomnia and weight loss are prominent. Trazodone: mainly used for insomnia at low doses |

<Callout title="First-Line = SSRI (or Mirtazapine if Sedation Needed)">
The approach from the flowchart [2]: ***suggest an SSRI or mirtazapine if sedation is required***. SSRIs are first-line because of their favourable safety-to-efficacy ratio. The choice between specific SSRIs is guided by side-effect profile, drug interactions, and patient preference.
</Callout>

#### D. The Cipriani Meta-Analysis (2018) — Key Evidence

***Systematic review and network meta-analysis of 21 antidepressants*** [3]:

- ***More effective than other antidepressants: agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine*** (range of ORs 1.19–1.96) [3]
- ***More tolerable than other antidepressants: agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, and vortioxetine*** (range of ORs 0.43–0.77) [3]

The sweet spot: **escitalopram** and **vortioxetine** appear in both the "more effective" and "more tolerable" lists, making them strong first-line choices.

#### E. Practical Prescribing Algorithm

The approach follows a logical stepwise escalation [2]:

**Step 1: Start antidepressant**
- Titrate to a recognised therapeutic dose
- Assess efficacy after **2 weeks** — explain to patient that full effect takes 2–6 weeks (because the therapeutic effect is not just about ↑ synaptic monoamines, but downstream neuroplastic changes: ↑ BDNF, hippocampal neurogenesis, receptor downregulation)

**Step 2: If effective**
- ***Continue for 6–9 months at full treatment dose*** [2]
- Consider longer-term treatment in recurrent depression

**Step 3: If NOT effective after 2 weeks**
- ***Assess weekly for a further 1–2 weeks. If still no response, consider increasing dose*** [2]

**Step 4: If poorly tolerated**
- ***Switch to a different antidepressant*** [2]
- Titrate to therapeutic dose, assess efficacy over 3–4 weeks

**Step 5: If 2nd antidepressant also fails**
- ***Consider third choice options: mirtazapine, vortioxetine, agomelatine*** [2]

**Step 6: Still no effect**
- Refer to **refractory depression** protocol (see below)

#### F. Duration of Treatment

**Continuation phase** [2]:
- ***First episode → continue antidepressants for ≥6–9 months at the dose that induces remission*** [2]
- This prevents relapse. Stopping too early is the most common cause of "failed" antidepressant treatment

**Maintenance phase** [2]:
- ***≥2 episodes + significant functional impairment → continue antidepressants for ≥2 years*** [2]
- Some guidelines recommend lifelong treatment after 3+ severe episodes

**Stopping** [2]:
- Gradual taper over ≥4 weeks to avoid **discontinuation syndrome** (dizziness, nausea, electric shock sensations, irritability, insomnia — especially common with paroxetine, venlafaxine)
- Never stop abruptly

#### G. Key Side Effects and Contraindications

| Class | Common Side Effects | Serious Risks | Contraindications |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SSRIs** | GI upset (nausea, diarrhoea), headache, sexual dysfunction, insomnia/agitation (initially), weight gain (long-term) | Serotonin syndrome (if combined with MAOIs), hyponatraemia (SIADH, especially elderly), ↑ suicidal ideation in < 25y (initial weeks), GI bleeding (esp with NSAIDs) | Concurrent MAOI use (≥2 week washout; 5 weeks for fluoxetine due to long half-life) |
| **SNRIs** | Similar to SSRIs + sweating, dry mouth; venlafaxine: dose-dependent ↑ BP | Serotonin syndrome, hyponatraemia, ↑ BP (venlafaxine) | Concurrent MAOI; uncontrolled HTN (venlafaxine) |
| **TCAs** | Anticholinergic (dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, blurred vision), sedation, orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, sexual dysfunction | **Lethal in overdose** (QT prolongation → ventricular arrhythmias → cardiac arrest; seizures) | Recent MI, heart block, arrhythmias, severe liver disease, acute angle-closure glaucoma, urinary retention. Avoid in suicidal patients (OD risk) |
| **MAOIs** (irreversible) | Orthostatic hypotension, weight gain, insomnia, sexual dysfunction | **Hypertensive crisis** with tyramine-rich foods (aged cheese, red wine, fermented foods, broad beans); serotonin syndrome with serotonergic drugs | Concurrent serotonergic drugs (SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, pethidine, tramadol); phaeochromocytoma; hepatic impairment |
| **Mirtazapine** | Sedation (H1), weight gain (H1 + 5-HT2C), dry mouth | Rare: agranulocytosis | Concurrent MAOI |
| **Bupropion** | Insomnia, dry mouth, agitation, headache | Seizures (dose-dependent; risk ~0.4% at therapeutic doses) | Seizure disorder, bulimia/anorexia (↑ seizure risk), concurrent MAOI |
| **Agomelatine** | Nausea, dizziness, headache, fatigue | **Hepatotoxicity** — requires LFT monitoring at baseline, 3w, 6w, 12w, 24w | Pre-existing hepatic impairment; concurrent potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) |

<Callout title="TCAs + Suicidal Patient = Dangerous Combination" type="error">
TCAs are **lethal in overdose** — as few as 10 days' supply can be fatal. The mechanism: sodium channel blockade → QRS widening → ventricular arrhythmias. This is why TCAs are avoided in patients with suicidal risk. SSRIs are far safer in overdose (very rarely fatal). If a TCA must be used, dispense limited quantities and consider supervised administration.
</Callout>

<Callout title="STAR*D Trial — What Happens When Drugs Fail?" type="idea">
The landmark **STAR*D** trial (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression) [2] showed cumulative remission rates across 4 treatment steps:

- Step 1: Citalopram → **28%** remission
- Step 2: Switch or augment → additional **~20–25%** remission
- Step 3: Switch or augment again → additional **~12–20%** remission
- Step 4: Tranylcypromine or mirtazapine + venlafaxine → additional **~7–14%** remission

Key lesson: With persistent, systematic treatment, ~**60–70%** of patients eventually remit — but each successive step has diminishing returns. Early, aggressive, optimised treatment matters.
</Callout>

### 3. Psychotherapy

***Psychosocial treatment*** is a core management modality [3].

The main psychotherapies for depression [2]:

| Therapy | Basis | Format | Mechanism | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy (CBT)*** | Beck's cognitive model — depression is maintained by negative automatic thoughts and cognitive distortions | Structured, 12–20 sessions, homework-based | Identifies and challenges negative thoughts (cognitive restructuring) + behavioural experiments + behavioural activation | Mild-moderate depression (monotherapy); moderate-severe (combined with medication); relapse prevention |
| ***Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)*** | Combines CBT with mindfulness meditation | Group format, 8 weeks | Teaches patients to observe thoughts non-judgementally rather than react to them → breaks rumination cycle | **Relapse prevention** in recurrent depression (≥3 episodes); NICE recommended |
| ***Interpersonal Therapy (IPT)*** | Problems with interpersonal life contribute to psychopathology | Brief (12–16 sessions), focused on current problems | Focus areas: grief over loss, interpersonal disputes, role transitions, interpersonal skill deficits → improve social functioning | Depression linked to interpersonal difficulties; equivalent efficacy to CBT |
| ***Psychodynamic therapy*** | Unconscious conflicts and early relational patterns shape current emotional experience | Longer-term (months to years) | Explore unconscious patterns, defence mechanisms, transference | Chronic/recurrent depression with personality factors; patients interested in deeper self-understanding |
| ***Behavioural activation*** | Withdrawal and inactivity perpetuate depression | Structured, brief | Scheduling of valued activities to counteract avoidance and withdrawal → increases positive reinforcement from environment | Mild-moderate; can be delivered by non-specialist |
| ***Group therapy*** | Various theoretical orientations | ~5–10 patients, weekly for 1h | Observation of psychological/behavioural responses to group members in a "safe" social setting | Adjunctive; social skills building; cost-effective |

**Efficacy and choice depends on patient features and type of depression** [2]:
- Mild depression: psychotherapy alone may be sufficient (CBT, behavioural activation, guided self-help)
- Moderate depression: psychotherapy + medication (combined is superior to either alone)
- Severe depression: medication is essential; psychotherapy is adjunctive (patients often too impaired cognitively for full engagement in therapy until medication begins to work)

<Callout title="When Psychotherapy Alone Is Sufficient">
For **mild depression**, evidence supports watchful waiting + low-intensity interventions (guided self-help, computerised CBT, behavioural activation, exercise) as first-line. Medications should be reserved for moderate-severe illness or when psychosocial interventions fail. This is the stepped-care principle.
</Callout>

### 4. Physical Treatments

#### A. Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)

"Electro" (electricity) + "convulsive" (seizure) + "therapy" — using electricity to induce a therapeutic seizure.

***Electroconvulsive therapy*** [3] — ***induction of seizure to treat psychiatric disorders*** [2]

**Mechanism of action**: Unknown precisely, but several hypotheses [2]:
- **Neuroendocrine**: ↑ hormonal release by hypothalamus and pituitary (PRL, TSH, ACTH, endorphins)
- **Neurotrophic**: ↑ BDNF → induces neurogenesis (may explain why multiple sessions needed)
- **Other**: ↑ monoamine neurotransmitter release, transient ↑ BBB permeability, changes in brain connectivity

**Indications** [2]:

ECT is indicated in severe depression when:
- ***Rapid definitive response required*** (e.g., pregnancy)
- ***Life-threatening*** (persistent suicidal intent, food refusal → malnutrition/dehydration)
- ***Antidepressants failed or cannot be used*** (refractory, medical comorbidities)
- ***Previous good response to ECT***
- ***Catatonia*** (depressive stupor)

> Mnemonic: **ECT** = **E**mergency, **C**atatonia, **T**reatment-refractory [2]

**Also indicated for** [2]:
- Mania/mixed states (pregnant, life-threatening, treatment-resistant)
- Puerperal psychosis with prominent mood symptoms (rapid treatment to allow reuniting with baby)
- Selective treatment-resistant schizophrenia

**Administration** [2]:
- Course: **6–12 treatments**, **2–3 per week**
- Process: Short-acting induction agent + muscle relaxant (suxamethonium) → ensure ~5 min of GA → psychiatrist applies two electrodes to scalp → electric pulse delivered to induce a **generalised tonic-clonic seizure lasting at least 15 seconds**
- **Unilateral vs bilateral**: bilateral is more effective but may cause more cognitive impairment. Unilateral (contralateral to dominant hemisphere) is used when cognitive effects are a concern

**Adverse effects** [2]:
- **Cognitive impairment**: acute confusion, anterograde or retrograde amnesia → generally short-lived (days after ECT)
- General complaints: headache, nausea, muscle pain
- **Mortality**: 2–4 per 100,000 (~other minor surgery under GA), usually due to cardiopulmonary events

**Contraindications**: No **absolute** contraindication. Relative contraindications include [2]:
- Heart disease: recent MI, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease
- ↑ ICP (risk of herniation during seizure)
- Risk of ICH: hypertension, recent stroke
- Phaeochromocytoma (seizure → catecholamine surge)
- Poor anaesthetic risk

**Efficacy**: ***ECT is considered more effective than drugs in the most severe cases*** [2]. It is especially effective for depression with psychosis and/or psychomotor retardation [2].

#### B. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)

***Transcranial magnetic stimulation*** [3][2]:
- **Procedure**: Non-invasive; hand-held plastic-coated coil placed close to scalp → external magnetic field stimulates generation of action potential and firing of neurones (targeting left dorsolateral PFC to counteract its hypoactivity in depression)
- **Use**: Suitable for ***medically unwell people who cannot tolerate antidepressants or ECT*** [2]
- **Side effects**: Minimal, but only available in selected centres
- FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression

#### C. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)

***Transcranial direct current stimulation*** [3][2]:
- **Procedure**: Non-invasive; constant, low-voltage DC via electrodes on head → anode increases cortical excitability, cathode decreases it → modulates spontaneous neuronal network activity
- **Use**: ***NOT suprathreshold*** (unlike TMS, ECT) → therefore limited to ***adjunctive use only*** [2]
- **Side effects**: Minimal, but only available in selected centres

---

### 5. Dietary and Lifestyle Interventions

***Healthy diet may help as part of the overall depression treatment, though no specific diet has been proven to relieve depression*** [3]:

- ***Food rich in antioxidants*** (e.g., blueberries, oranges, carrots, nuts) [3] — oxidative stress is implicated in depression; antioxidants may have neuroprotective effects
- ***Complex carbohydrates*** (e.g., whole grains) ***can have a calming effect*** [3] — they ↑ tryptophan transport across BBB → ↑ serotonin synthesis
- ***Protein-rich foods*** (e.g., turkey, tuna, chicken) ***boost alertness*** [3] — contain tyrosine (dopamine/NE precursor) and tryptophan (serotonin precursor)
- ***Mediterranean diet as a source for B vitamins*** [3] — B6, B12, and folate are cofactors in monoamine synthesis; deficiency → impaired serotonin/dopamine production

***Omega-3 fatty acids*** [3]:
- ***Essential polyunsaturated lipids that influence cellular metabolism and function*** [3]
- ***Earlier studies linked low seafood intake (a major source of omega-3 FAs) and mood disorders, and positive results with fish oil intervention → subsequent results more diversified*** [3]
- ***EPA rather than DHA as the effective component*** [3] — EPA has anti-inflammatory properties (↓ pro-inflammatory cytokines → ↓ neuroinflammation)
- ***Monotherapy as well as adjunct therapy*** [3]

---

### 6. Refractory (Treatment-Resistant) Depression

Defined as failure to respond adequately to ≥2 adequate trials of antidepressants from different classes.

**Approach** [2]:

First, **reconsider the fundamentals**:
- ***Reassess diagnosis***: look for secondary causes (e.g., substance abuse, medical conditions, personality disorder, bipolar disorder)
- ***Assess compliance***: are they actually taking the medication? At adequate dose? For adequate duration?
- ***Assess for ongoing psychosocial stressors***: no antidepressant will overcome ongoing abuse, poverty, or entrapment

Then, **therapeutic options** [2]:

| Strategy | Details |
|---|---|
| ***Switch to another class*** | Usually done ***first***, preferably of a ***different mechanism*** (e.g., SSRI → SNRI, or SSRI → mirtazapine). Beware of serotonin syndrome and discontinuation syndrome → cross-tapering [2] |
| ***Combination therapy*** | Usually 5-HT mechanism (SSRI, venlafaxine) + NE/DA mechanism (bupropion, mirtazapine) → "California rocket fuel" = venlafaxine + mirtazapine [2] |
| ***Augmentation with lithium*** | Well-established evidence. Target level 0.4 mmol/L for augmentation in unipolar depression. Monitor RFT, TFT, plasma Li [2] |
| ***Augmentation with antipsychotics*** | Low-dose atypical antipsychotic, especially if psychotic features present. ***Antipsychotics licensed for augmentation: quetiapine, aripiprazole*** [2] |
| ***Augmentation with T3 (tri-iodothyronine)*** | Even in euthyroid patients, T3 25–50 μg/day can augment antidepressant response. Mechanism: T3 enhances serotonergic neurotransmission [2] |
| ***ECT*** | ***Considered more effective than drugs in the most severe cases. Indications: emergency, refractory, catatonic*** [2] |

> **Options for refractory depression** [2]: ***Optimise existing treatment → Augmentation by antipsychotics, Li or T3 → Combine with another antidepressant with another mechanism → Switch to another mechanism***

Newer options (for severe treatment-resistant cases):
- **Esketamine** (nasal spray) — NMDA receptor antagonist; approved for treatment-resistant depression; rapid onset (hours to days vs weeks for traditional antidepressants)
- **Psilocybin-assisted therapy** — emerging evidence; not yet standard practice
- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)** — experimental; targets subcallosal cingulate (area 25)

---

### 7. Special Populations

| Population | Key Considerations |
|---|---|
| **Elderly** | Start low, go slow. Increased sensitivity to anticholinergic effects (TCAs → avoid). SSRI-induced hyponatraemia more common. Use Geriatric Depression Scale for assessment [3] |
| **Children and adolescents** | ***In children and adolescents, depressed mood can be irritable mood*** [3]. Fluoxetine is the only SSRI with robust evidence in paediatric depression. Beware of increased suicidal ideation with SSRIs in under-25s (black box warning) — monitor closely in first weeks |
| **Pregnancy** | Risk-benefit analysis. Untreated severe depression carries risks (poor nutrition, substance use, suicide, impaired bonding). SSRIs generally considered acceptable (sertraline, fluoxetine have most data). Paroxetine associated with cardiac malformations — avoid. ECT is safe in pregnancy [2] |
| **Peripartum** | ***With peripartum onset — severe anxiety and even panic attacks. Risk of infanticide*** [5]. Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale for screening [3]. Breastfeeding: sertraline has lowest infant exposure |
| **Psychotic depression** | Antidepressant alone insufficient — requires **antidepressant + antipsychotic** or **ECT** |
| **Bipolar depression** | ***NOT identical to Tx of unipolar depression*** [2]. ***Conventional antidepressants are less effective, associated with risk of inducing mania, and risk of inducing rapid cycling*** [2]. First-line: quetiapine or olanzapine + fluoxetine. Antidepressants should be ***combined with antipsychotic or mood stabiliser*** [2] |

<Callout title="Bipolar Depression ≠ Unipolar Depression Treatment" type="error">
This is a critical exam point. ***Conventional antidepressants are (1) less effective in treating bipolar depression, (2) associated with risk of inducing mania, (3) associated with risk of inducing rapid cycling*** [2]. ***SSRIs may be effective but may induce mania. TCAs and SNRIs have ↑↑ risk of inducing mania*** [2]. Always use mood stabiliser cover.
</Callout>

### 8. Course and Prognosis

Understanding prognosis helps guide duration of treatment [2]:

- **Clinical course**: generally ***self-limiting within 6 months to 1 year*** [2]
  - Age of onset: ~50% before age 21
  - Duration: average 6 months; ~25% > 1 year; ~10–20% chronic unremitting
- **Recurrence**: ***~80% will recur***, average ***~4 further episodes in 25 years*** [2]
  - Usually associated with ***progressive shortening of interval*** between episodes
  - ***~50% do not have complete symptom remission*** between episodes
  - ***Only ~25% of those with recurrent major depression achieve 5-year clinical stability*** with good social and occupational performance [2]
- **Mortality**: ***> 20× risk of suicide***, can approach ***15% in those with severe admitted cases*** [2]

**Prognostic factors for relapse** [2]:
1. Incomplete symptomatic remission
2. Early age of onset
3. Poor social support
4. Poor physical health
5. Comorbid substance abuse
6. Comorbid personality disorder

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Stepped-Care Model**: Mild → watchful waiting + psychosocial. Moderate → antidepressant + psychotherapy. Severe → antidepressant + psychotherapy + consider inpatient. Psychotic → antidepressant + antipsychotic or ECT. Life-threatening/catatonic → ECT first-line.

**First-Line Pharmacotherapy**: SSRI (or mirtazapine if sedation needed). Cipriani meta-analysis: escitalopram, vortioxetine = effective + tolerable. Older antidepressants (TCAs, MAOIs) = more side effects and dangerous in OD.

**Duration**: Continue ≥6–9 months at full dose after remission (first episode). ≥2 years if ≥2 episodes with functional impairment. Taper gradually (≥4 weeks).

**Refractory Depression**: Reassess diagnosis/compliance/stressors → switch class → combine (SSRI + mirtazapine or bupropion) → augment (Li, quetiapine/aripiprazole, T3) → ECT.

**ECT Indications**: Emergency (suicidal, food refusal), Catatonia, Treatment-refractory. No absolute CI. Most effective treatment for severe depression, especially with psychosis/psychomotor retardation.

**Psychotherapy**: CBT is most evidence-based. IPT for interpersonal issues. MBCT for relapse prevention. Combine with medication for moderate-severe.

**Bipolar Depression**: NOT same as unipolar Tx. Antidepressant monotherapy contraindicated (mania risk). Use quetiapine or olanzapine + fluoxetine.

**Prognosis**: 80% recur; average 4 episodes over 25 years; > 20× suicide risk. Prognostic factors for relapse: incomplete remission, early onset, poor social support, poor physical health, comorbid SA, comorbid PD.

      question: "Why is antidepressant monotherapy contraindicated in bipolar depression? What should be used instead?",
      markscheme: "Conventional antidepressants in bipolar depression are: (1) less effective than in unipolar depression, (2) associated with risk of inducing manic switch, (3) associated with risk of inducing rapid cycling. TCAs and SNRIs have highest mania-induction risk; SSRIs have lower but still significant risk. Instead, use: first-line quetiapine alone or olanzapine + fluoxetine combination; alternatives include lithium, lamotrigine. If antidepressant is used, it must be combined with a mood stabiliser or antipsychotic, never given alone.",

      question: "From the Cipriani 2018 network meta-analysis, which antidepressants were found to be both more effective and more tolerable than others?",
      markscheme: "More effective: agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, vortioxetine (ORs 1.19-1.96). More tolerable: agomelatine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine (ORs 0.43-0.77). Drugs appearing in BOTH lists (effective + tolerable): escitalopram, vortioxetine, agomelatine - making them particularly strong first-line choices.",

      question: "What are the prognostic factors for relapse in MDD, and what is the overall recurrence rate?",
      markscheme: "Recurrence rate: approximately 80% will have at least one further episode; average 4 episodes over 25 years. Only 25% achieve 5-year clinical stability. Prognostic factors for relapse: (1) incomplete symptomatic remission, (2) early age of onset, (3) poor social support, (4) poor physical health, (5) comorbid substance abuse, (6) comorbid personality disorder. Mortality: more than 20x risk of suicide, approaching 15% in severe admitted cases.",
