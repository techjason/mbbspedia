## Differential Diagnosis of Phaeochromocytoma

The differential diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma is really the differential of its **presenting features** — namely paroxysmal or sustained hypertension, adrenergic "spells" (headache, sweating, palpitations, pallor), and adrenal mass. The way to think about this is: "What else could mimic a catecholamine-excess state?" We will systematically work through the differentials by clinical presentation.

---

### 9.1 Conceptual Framework — Why is the DDx Important?

Phaeochromocytoma is **rare** (~0.1–0.6% of hypertensives) but **deadly if missed** [1][2]. The classic triad of headache + sweating + palpitations is non-specific — many conditions can mimic it. Conversely, phaeochromocytoma itself can masquerade as panic disorder, thyrotoxicosis, essential hypertension, or even an acute cardiac event. The differential therefore runs in two directions:

1. **Patient presents with adrenergic "spells"** → What else besides phaeochromocytoma?
2. **Patient presents with an adrenal mass** → What else besides phaeochromocytoma?

We will address both scenarios.

### 9.2 Differential Diagnosis of Adrenergic "Spells" (Paroxysmal Hypertension + Sympathetic Symptoms)

This is the core DDx in clinical practice and exams. The conditions below can all produce episodic hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, headache, and anxiety — the hallmarks of phaeochromocytoma.

#### A. Endocrine Causes

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics Phaeochromocytoma |
|---|---|---|
| **Thyrotoxicosis** (hyperthyroidism) | Persistent (not paroxysmal) symptoms; weight loss despite ↑ appetite; heat intolerance; tremor; goitre; lid lag; AF. TFTs: ↑ T4, ↓ TSH | Thyroid hormones are synergistic with catecholamines — they upregulate β-adrenergic receptor expression, amplifying the sympathetic "tone." This causes tachycardia, sweating, tremor, hypermetabolism. But thyrotoxicosis is **continuous**, not paroxysmal. |
| **Carcinoid syndrome** | **Flushing** (NOT pallor), diarrhoea, bronchoconstriction, right-sided valvular heart disease. ↑ 24h urinary 5-HIAA | Serotonin and other vasoactive amines → episodic flushing and haemodynamic instability. Key distinction: **carcinoid = flushing; phaeochromocytoma = pallor** (α₁ vasoconstriction) [1][2] |
| **Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome)** | Sustained hypertension + hypokalaemia; no paroxysms; metabolic alkalosis. ↑ Aldosterone:Renin ratio (ARR) | Both cause hypertension, but Conn's is sustained and associated with **hypokalaemia** (K⁺ wasting). No sympathetic "spells." Differentiated by ARR screening [2] |
| **Cushing's syndrome** | Cushingoid habitus (moon face, buffalo hump, central obesity, striae, proximal myopathy); sustained hypertension; diabetes. ↑ cortisol on ONDST | Cortisol excess causes hypertension (via mineralocorticoid effect and vascular sensitisation to catecholamines) but is **sustained**, not paroxysmal. No classic triad. [2] |
| **Insulinoma / Hypoglycaemia** | Whipple's triad: hypoglycaemic symptoms + documented low BG + relief with glucose. Sweating, tremor, palpitations, anxiety | Hypoglycaemia triggers a **counter-regulatory catecholamine surge** (adrenal medulla releases adrenaline to raise glucose). This produces adrenergic symptoms identical to phaeochromocytoma. Key: check blood glucose during the "spell" — low glucose points to hypoglycaemia, not phaeochromocytoma [2] |
| **Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)** | Thyroid nodule; elevated calcitonin; may have diarrhoea; often in MEN2 context | MTC can co-exist with phaeochromocytoma in MEN2. Calcitonin and prostaglandins from MTC can cause flushing and diarrhoea. If MEN2 is suspected, both must be investigated [1] |

#### B. Cardiovascular Causes

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics |
|---|---|---|
| **Essential hypertension (with anxiety)** | By far the most common cause of "spells" in clinical practice; no biochemical catecholamine excess; responds to standard antihypertensives | "White coat hypertension" or anxiety-related surges can mimic paroxysmal hypertension. Negative metanephrines rule out phaeochromocytoma. |
| **Renovascular hypertension** | Young female (fibromuscular dysplasia) or elderly with atherosclerosis; renal artery bruit; resistant HTN; ↑ renin. MRA/CTA shows renal artery stenosis | Activation of RAAS → sustained hypertension. Not paroxysmal. |
| **Heart failure / Acute pulmonary oedema** | Dyspnoea, orthopnoea, PND, bilateral crepitations, raised JVP, peripheral oedema | Phaeochromocytoma crisis can present AS acute pulmonary oedema (catecholamine cardiomyopathy). If a young patient presents with unexplained APO, always consider phaeochromocytoma [2] |
| **Arrhythmias (e.g. paroxysmal SVT, AF)** | Palpitations, lightheadedness; ECG shows arrhythmia; no hypertension during episodes typically | Paroxysmal arrhythmias cause palpitations and sweating, but no sustained hypertension between episodes. ECG and Holter monitoring differentiate. |
| **Aortic coarctation** | Young patient; upper limb hypertension + radio-femoral delay; rib notching on CXR | Causes secondary hypertension but is structural, not hormonal. |

#### C. Neurological / Psychiatric Causes

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics |
|---|---|---|
| **Panic disorder / Anxiety** | Situational triggers; symptoms occur in specific contexts (social, phobic); normal BP between attacks; normal metanephrines; responds to SSRIs/CBT | Panic attacks activate the sympathetic nervous system → tachycardia, sweating, tremor, chest tightness, feeling of doom. Clinically almost indistinguishable from phaeochromocytoma spells. **Any patient diagnosed with panic disorder should arguably have metanephrines checked at least once to rule out phaeochromocytoma.** |
| **Autonomic epilepsy (diencephalic epilepsy)** | Associated seizure activity; EEG abnormalities | Rare cause of paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity. |
| **Baroreflex failure** | Post-neck surgery or radiation; volatile BP; ↓ HR variability | Damage to baroreceptors (e.g. after carotid body tumour resection or neck irradiation) → loss of buffering → extreme BP lability. Normal metanephrines. |
| **Autonomic neuropathy (e.g. in diabetes)** | Known diabetic; postural hypotension predominates; loss of HR variability | Loss of autonomic regulation → fluctuating BP. |

#### D. Drug / Substance-Related Causes

| Substance | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Sympathomimetics** (cocaine, amphetamines, ephedrine, pseudoephedrine) | Directly stimulate catecholamine release or block reuptake → mimics catecholamine excess state. Always take a thorough drug and social history. |
| **MAO inhibitors + tyramine-containing foods** | MAOIs block catecholamine breakdown → tyramine in foods (cheese, wine, fermented products) triggers massive NE release → "cheese reaction" → hypertensive crisis |
| **Withdrawal syndromes** (alcohol, clonidine, beta-blockers) | Sudden cessation → rebound sympathetic activation → hypertension, tachycardia, sweating |
| **Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)** | Block NE reuptake → potentiate catecholamine effects; can also trigger a crisis in undiagnosed phaeochromocytoma [2] |
| **Caffeine excess** | Adenosine receptor antagonism → sympathetic activation; can cause palpitations, anxiety, tremor |

<Callout title="Common Exam Trap" type="error">
The most common misdiagnosis for phaeochromocytoma is **essential hypertension + panic disorder**. A young hypertensive patient with paroxysmal "anxiety attacks" who is dismissed as having panic disorder, only to later develop a hypertensive crisis intra-operatively — this is a classic exam scenario. The take-home: always check metanephrines in unexplained paroxysmal hypertension, resistant hypertension, or atypical panic disorder.

### 9.3 Differential Diagnosis of an Adrenal Mass (Adrenal Incidentaloma Context)

When phaeochromocytoma presents as an incidentally found adrenal mass, the DDx is that of **adrenal incidentaloma** [2]:

#### Benign Adrenal Masses

| Diagnosis | Frequency | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Non-functional adrenal adenoma*** | ***~80–90% of incidentalomas (MC)*** [2] | Lipid-rich on CT ( < 10 HU unenhanced); no hormonal excess; small ( < 4cm); stable on follow-up |
| **Adrenal cyst** | Uncommon | Well-defined, thin-walled, fluid density on CT |
| **Myelolipoma** | Uncommon | Contains macroscopic fat (negative HU on CT); pathognomonic appearance |
| **Haemangioma** | Rare | Vascular lesion; phleboliths may be seen |
| ***Functional adenoma (Cushing's / Conn's)*** | ~6% subclinical Cushing's; ~1% Conn's [2] | Screen with ONDST and ARR respectively |
| **Phaeochromocytoma** | ~5% of incidentalomas | Must exclude biochemically BEFORE any biopsy/surgery |

#### Malignant Adrenal Masses

| Diagnosis | Key Features |
|---|---|
| ***Adrenocortical carcinoma*** | Large ( > 4cm often > 6cm); irregular; high unenhanced HU ( > 10); may show steroid overproduction; heterogeneous enhancement + slow washout [2] |
| **Malignant phaeochromocytoma** | Defined by metastasis (cannot be distinguished histologically from benign); metastases to bone, liver, lung, lymph nodes [2] |
| ***Adrenal metastasis (secondary — more common than primary malignancy)*** | History of known primary malignancy (lung, breast, melanoma, kidney, colon are common primaries); bilateral in ~50%; often > 3cm; irregular [2] |
| **Neuroblastoma** | Predominantly in children ( < 5 years); elevated urine VMA/HVA; adrenal medulla origin (like phaeochromocytoma but undifferentiated neural crest) [1] |
| **Primary adrenal lymphoma** | Extremely rare; usually bilateral; associated with adrenal insufficiency |

<Callout title="The Three Screening Tests for Any Adrenal Incidentaloma">
For every adrenal incidentaloma, you must answer: **Functional? Malignant?** [2]

***Functional screening: ONDST + spot ARR + 24h urine metanephrines*** [2]

| Condition | Screening Test | Confirmation |
|---|---|---|
| Cushing's syndrome | 1mg ONDST ( > 50 nmol/L) | Low-dose DST |
| Conn's syndrome | Aldosterone:Renin ratio | Salt loading / saline suppression |
| Phaeochromocytoma | 24h urine metanephrines | Clonidine suppression test |

**Malignancy assessment**: Size ( > 4cm suspicious), growth rate ( > 0.5cm in 6 months), imaging characteristics (unenhanced HU > 10, heterogeneous, irregular margins, slow contrast washout).

### 9.6 Special Consideration — Differentiating Phaeochromocytoma from Other Functional Adrenal Tumours

Within the adrenal incidentaloma framework, the three functional conditions form a common exam comparison:

| Parameter | Phaeochromocytoma | Cushing's Syndrome | Conn's Syndrome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Origin** | Adrenal medulla (chromaffin cells) | Adrenal cortex (zona fasciculata) | Adrenal cortex (zona glomerulosa) |
| **Hormone** | Catecholamines | Cortisol | Aldosterone |
| **BP pattern** | Paroxysmal ± sustained | Sustained | Sustained |
| **Key metabolic** | Hyperglycaemia, weight loss | Hyperglycaemia, weight gain, proximal myopathy | Hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis |
| **Classic clue** | Triad: headache, sweating, palpitations | Moon face, buffalo hump, striae | Hypertension + hypokalaemia |
| **Screen** | 24h urine metanephrines | 1mg ONDST | ARR |
| **Pre-op caution** | α-blockade → β-blockade, volume expansion | Steroid cover (suppressed HPA axis) | Correct K⁺ (spironolactone) |

---

### 9.7 Approach to "False Positives" in Biochemical Testing

An important clinical nuance: mildly elevated metanephrines do not always mean phaeochromocytoma. Understanding **false positives** is critical to avoid unnecessary surgery [2]:

| Cause of False Positive | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Stress, acute illness, OSA*** [2] | Physiological sympathetic activation → increased catecholamine release → elevated metanephrines |
| ***Drugs: TCAs, α-agonists (e.g. clonidine withdrawal), levodopa, MAOIs, methyldopa, labetalol, sotalol*** [1][2] | Interfere with catecholamine metabolism or assay — e.g. TCAs block NE reuptake → higher synaptic NE → higher metanephrine production; labetalol can directly interfere with the HPLC assay |
| ***Caffeine, chocolate, bananas*** [1] | Contain catecholamines or catecholamine precursors that can mildly elevate urinary catecholamines (less of an issue with metanephrine assays) |
| **Chronic renal failure** | Impaired renal clearance → accumulation of metanephrines (plasma metanephrines preferred over 24h urine in CRF) [2] |
| **Sample collection issues** | Stress of venepuncture → sympathetic activation. ***Plasma samples should be drawn after 30 minutes of supine rest via an indwelling cannula*** [2] |

**Management of borderline results**: Stop interfering medications for at least 1 week (if safe) → repeat testing. If still borderline → **clonidine suppression test** [2].

<Callout title="Clonidine Suppression Test — How and Why">
**Clonidine** ("clon" = from Greek for "twig" — named for its structural similarity to certain compounds) is a central α₂-agonist. It activates presynaptic α₂ receptors in the brainstem → ↓ central sympathetic outflow → ↓ peripheral NE release → ↓ plasma catecholamines.

In a **normal person** or in **false positive** elevation: clonidine administration → plasma NE drops significantly (suppresses).

In **phaeochromocytoma**: the tumour autonomously secretes catecholamines independent of central sympathetic regulation → plasma NE **fails to suppress** after clonidine.

**Procedure** [2]: Fast overnight → indwelling cannula 30 min before → baseline bloods for Epi and NE (x2, 5 min apart) → PO clonidine 0.3mg with 250mL water → monitor BP/Pulse Q30min → bloods at 2h and 3h post-clonidine.

**C/I**: Pregnancy.

### 9.8 When Phaeochromocytoma Masquerades as Something Else

Just as other conditions mimic phaeochromocytoma, phaeochromocytoma can present atypically:

| Atypical Presentation | How It Mimics Another Condition |
|---|---|
| **Takotsubo-like cardiomyopathy** | Young patient with APO, apical ballooning on echo, normal coronaries — actually catecholamine cardiomyopathy |
| **Acute MI** | Demand ischaemia from severe HTN + coronary vasospasm → troponin rise, ECG changes |
| **Stroke / ICH** | Hypertensive crisis → intracerebral haemorrhage [2] |
| **Diabetes mellitus** | Chronic α₂-mediated insulin suppression + β₂ glycogenolysis → hyperglycaemia |
| **"Resistant" essential hypertension** | Sustained HTN not responding to standard therapy — always check metanephrines |
| **Perioperative crisis** | Undiagnosed phaeochromocytoma → anaesthetic induction → crisis → cardiovascular collapse. This is the #1 reason screening is mandatory before any adrenal surgery. |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — DDx">

1. **The DDx of phaeochromocytoma is the DDx of paroxysmal hypertension + adrenergic spells + adrenal mass.**

2. **Most common mimic in clinical practice**: Essential hypertension + panic disorder. Always check metanephrines in atypical anxiety with hypertension.

3. **Key distinction from carcinoid**: Phaeochromocytoma = **pallor**; Carcinoid = **flushing**.

4. **Key distinction from thyrotoxicosis**: Thyrotoxicosis = **continuous**; Phaeochromocytoma = **paroxysmal**.

5. **Adrenal incidentaloma DDx**: Non-functional adenoma (MC), functional adenoma (Cushing's/Conn's/Phaeo), adrenocortical carcinoma, metastasis (more common than primary malignancy), myelolipoma, cyst. Screening: ***ONDST + ARR + 24h urine metanephrines***.

6. **False positives**: Stress, OSA, drugs (TCAs, labetalol, methyldopa, levodopa), caffeine, chocolate, bananas, CRF. Manage by stopping interfering drugs → repeat testing → clonidine suppression test if borderline.

7. **Clonidine suppression test**: Central α₂-agonist → suppresses NE release from normal sympathetic neurons; autonomous tumour secretion is **not suppressed** → failure to suppress = phaeochromocytoma.

8. **Phaeochromocytoma can masquerade as**: Takotsubo, acute MI, stroke/ICH, resistant HTN, perioperative crisis, diabetes.

Failure to suppress confirms phaeochromocytoma."
