## Complications of Anorectal Abscess

Complications of anorectal abscess can be divided into those arising from **the disease itself** (if inadequately treated or left untreated) and those arising from **the treatment** (surgical complications). Think of it as a spectrum: the abscess is the acute event, and complications represent either **progression** of the disease or **consequences** of intervention.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease (Untreated / Inadequately Treated Abscess)

#### 1.1 Fistula-in-Ano (Anorectal Fistula) — THE Most Common Complication

This is the single most important complication and the natural chronic sequela of an anorectal abscess.

**Incidence**: 30–50% of anorectal abscesses will develop an associated fistula [2][4][5].

**Pathophysiology (from first principles)**:
1. The anorectal abscess originates from an infected anal crypt gland → abscess forms in the intersphincteric plane → tracks outward
2. When the abscess is drained (surgically or by spontaneous rupture), the **external opening** (at the skin) heals
3. However, the **internal opening** — the original infected crypt at the dentate line — often remains **patent**
4. This creates a persistent communication between the anal canal lumen (internal opening at crypt) and the perianal skin (external opening where abscess drained)
5. The tract becomes lined with **granulation tissue** that eventually epithelialises → prevents spontaneous closure → chronic fistula

***Anorectal fistula is the chronic phase of suppuration in this perirectal process*** [2].

**Clinical presentation**:
- Intermittent perianal discharge (purulent, malodorous) + pain that builds until pus discharges, then temporarily relieves [5]
- Palpable cord-like tract [5]
- External opening visible as a dimple of granulation tissue
- ***Suspect anal fistula if anorectal abscess persists after 6–12 weeks*** [5]

**Classification** — Parks Classification [5]:

| Type | Name | Frequency | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| I | ***Intersphincteric*** | 45% | Tract between IAS and EAS |
| II | ***Transsphincteric*** | 30% | Tract crosses through EAS into ischiorectal fossa |
| III | ***Suprasphincteric*** | 20% | Tract loops above entire sphincter apparatus |
| IV | ***Extrasphincteric*** | 5% | Tract bypasses sphincter entirely; opens into rectum |

**Why does this matter?** The type of fistula determines the surgical approach:
- Simple fistulas (Type I, low Type II) → ***fistulotomy/fistulectomy*** [9]
- Complex fistulas (high Type II, Type III, IV) → ***seton drainage → staged sphincter-sparing procedures*** [9][10]

<Callout title="Predicting Fistula Risk from Pus Culture">
Remember the pearl from earlier: ***Culture shows skin flora: no fistula → reassurance. Culture shows gut flora: likely with fistula → treat as fistula after acute state*** [4]. This makes biological sense — gut flora (*E. coli*, *Bacteroides*) in the pus means there is an internal communication with the bowel lumen, i.e., the infected crypt is still patent.
</Callout>

#### 1.2 Recurrence of Abscess

**Incidence**: 10–30% after I&D alone (without primary fistulotomy); drops to ~5–10% if primary fistulotomy is performed for simple fistulas [1].

**Why does recurrence happen?**
- The **internal opening** (infected crypt gland) is the source — if it is not addressed at the time of drainage, the crypt remains a portal for bacterial re-entry → new abscess forms
- Inadequate drainage (undrained loculations, premature wound closure) → residual pus → re-accumulation
- Underlying predisposing condition (***Crohn's disease***, ***TB***, ***immunosuppression***) not recognised or treated [3]

**How to reduce recurrence**:
- Thorough drainage with **breaking of all loculations**
- ***?Primary fistulotomy*** at time of I&D for simple, low fistulas [1]
- Send **pus for C/ST** → if gut flora, plan for fistula follow-up at 6–12 weeks
- Investigate and treat underlying causes (Crohn's, TB, DM, HIV) if atypical features

#### 1.3 Progression to Adjacent Spaces (Extension of Abscess)

If an abscess is not drained promptly, pus continues to track along **paths of least resistance** (Parks' theory) [4]:

| Starting Point | Extension | Resulting Abscess |
|---|---|---|
| Intersphincteric | Downward through IAS | Perianal abscess |
| Intersphincteric | Laterally through EAS | Ischiorectal abscess |
| Intersphincteric | Upward above levator ani | ***Supralevator abscess*** |
| Ischiorectal | Posteriorly via deep postanal space → contralateral ischiorectal fossa | **Horseshoe abscess** (bilateral ischiorectal) |

A **horseshoe abscess** is a particularly challenging complication — it requires drainage of both ischiorectal fossae plus counter-drainage of the deep postanal space (modified Hanley procedure) [10].

#### 1.4 Necrotising Fasciitis (Fournier's Gangrene)

This is the most feared and life-threatening complication.

**Pathophysiology**:
- Perianal sepsis spreads from the localised abscess into the subcutaneous tissues and fascial planes of the perineum, genitalia, and abdominal wall
- **Synergistic polymicrobial infection** (aerobic + anaerobic organisms) produces enzymes (collagenases, hyaluronidases, lipases) that destroy fascial planes → obliterative endarteritis of subcutaneous blood vessels → tissue ischaemia and necrosis → gas production by anaerobes → subcutaneous emphysema
- The name: **Fournier** = Jean-Alfred Fournier, French venereologist who described the condition; **gangrene** = Greek *gangraina* = "eating sore" — tissue death

**Risk factors**: ***Immunosuppression*** (diabetes mellitus is the most common; also HIV, alcoholism, malignancy, chemotherapy) [1][4], delayed diagnosis or treatment

**Clinical features**:
- **Pain out of proportion** to examination findings (early clue — the necrosis extends far beyond what is visible)
- Rapidly spreading erythema, oedema, and skin discolouration (dusky, dark)
- **Crepitus** (subcutaneous gas — palpable crackling under the skin)
- Skin blistering, necrotic eschars
- Systemic toxicity: high fever, tachycardia, hypotension, septic shock
- Foul-smelling "dishwater" exudate

**Management**:
- **Emergency**: This is a surgical emergency with mortality of 20–40%
- Aggressive surgical **debridement** (wide excision of all necrotic tissue; often requires multiple returns to theatre)
- Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (Meropenem + Vancomycin + Clindamycin)
- ICU support (fluid resuscitation, vasopressors, organ support)
- **Faecal diversion** (defunctioning colostomy) may be needed to protect the wound
- Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) dressing for wound management
- Delayed reconstruction (skin grafting) once infection controlled

<Callout title="Fournier's Gangrene — Never Miss" type="error">
Any patient with perianal abscess who develops **disproportionate pain**, **crepitus**, **rapidly spreading erythema**, or **systemic toxicity** must be assessed for necrotising fasciitis immediately. Delayed surgical debridement is associated with exponentially increasing mortality. This is especially common in **diabetic and immunocompromised** patients.
</Callout>

#### 1.5 Systemic Sepsis and Bacteraemia

**Pathophysiology**: Bacteria from the abscess cavity enter the systemic circulation (bacteraemia) → systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) → sepsis → septic shock → multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) if untreated.

**Risk factors**: Large or deep-seated abscesses (ischiorectal, supralevator), immunocompromised patients, delayed drainage.

**Clinical features**: Fever > 38°C, rigors, tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, oliguria.

**Management**: Blood cultures → empirical broad-spectrum IV antibiotics → urgent surgical drainage (source control) → ICU care if severe sepsis.

**Rare but catastrophic extension**: Septic portal pyaemia — bacteria from the perianal venous plexus enter the portal venous system → travel to the liver → **pyogenic liver abscess** formation. This is rare but well-described in the literature for any pelvic/abdominal septic source.

#### 1.6 Anal Stenosis/Stricture

**Pathophysiology**: Repeated episodes of abscess formation and drainage → chronic inflammation → fibrosis and scarring of the anal canal → narrowing of the anal lumen (stenosis).

**Clinical features**: Difficulty passing stool, thin "ribbon-like" stools, straining, incomplete evacuation.

**Management**: Anal dilatation; may require anoplasty (surgical reconstruction of the anal canal) in severe cases.

### 2. Complications of Treatment (Surgical Complications)

#### 2.1 Faecal Incontinence

**The most important surgical complication to understand and prevent.**

**Pathophysiology**:
- The **sphincter complex** (IAS + EAS + puborectalis) is responsible for maintaining continence
- Any surgical procedure that **divides sphincter muscle** risks incontinence:
  - **Fistulotomy** for simple fistula: divides the overlying sphincter muscle to lay open the tract → if the tract involves a significant portion of the EAS ( > 30%), fistulotomy risks incontinence
  - **Incorrect drainage route**: e.g., draining an intersphincteric abscess through the perianal skin (creating a transsphincteric tract) or draining a supralevator abscess through the wrong route → **extrasphincteric fistula** → devastating incontinence
  - **Cutting seton**: gradually cuts through sphincter muscle; if not done carefully, excessive muscle division occurs

***Risk of incontinence should be informed*** [9].

**Prevention**:
- Choose the **correct drainage route** for each abscess type [4]
- Perform fistulotomy only for **simple, low fistulas** (Parks Type I, low Type II) [9]
- Use **sphincter-sparing procedures** (seton, advancement flap, LIFT) for complex fistulas [9][10]
- Pre-operative assessment of sphincter function (manometry, EUS) in patients with any pre-existing incontinence

| Continence Mechanism | Contribution | Implication |
|---|---|---|
| IAS (smooth muscle) | ~70–85% of resting tone | Damage during internal sphincterotomy (for intersphincteric abscess drainage) may cause minor soiling/urgency |
| EAS (skeletal muscle) | Voluntary squeeze pressure | Damage during fistulotomy → inability to defer defaecation; urgency; incontinence to formed/liquid stool |
| Puborectalis | Anorectal angle (80–90°) | Damage → loss of gross continence; rare with standard procedures |

#### 2.2 Wound-Related Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Delayed wound healing** | The wound is left open to heal by secondary intention → healing depends on granulation from the base → if impaired (DM, malnutrition, smoking, immunosuppression), healing is prolonged | Average healing time: 4–8 weeks for perianal abscess; longer for ischiorectal. Optimise glycaemic control, nutrition, and smoking cessation. |
| **Premature wound closure** | The skin edges close before the deep cavity has granulated → trapped cavity → recurrent abscess | Why we excise an ellipse of skin (de-roofing) rather than making a simple linear incision — this prevents premature closure. Daily wound care and packing keep the wound open. |
| **Wound infection / Secondary infection** | Despite drainage, secondary bacterial contamination of the open wound (proximity to anus) → local infection | Wound care, sitz baths, and hygiene; antibiotics only if cellulitis develops. |

#### 2.3 Bleeding

**Pathophysiology**: The perianal and anorectal region has a rich blood supply (branches of the inferior and superior rectal arteries; internal pudendal artery). Surgical incision → vessel injury → bleeding.

- Usually minor and self-limiting (controlled by pressure, packing, or cautery)
- Rarely significant; massive haemorrhage is uncommon
- Risk increased with: coagulopathy, anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, deep abscesses near major vessels

#### 2.4 Urinary Retention (Post-Operative)

**Pathophysiology**: Same mechanism as the pre-operative symptom — **reflex urinary retention** via shared pudendal nerve innervation (S2–S4). Post-operative pain, local swelling, the effects of anaesthesia (especially spinal/epidural), opioid analgesics, and rectal packing all contribute to urethral sphincter spasm.

**Management**: Remove rectal packing; adequate analgesia (avoid excessive opioids); trial of micturition → if unable to void, insert urinary catheter for 24 hours [6].

#### 2.5 Iatrogenic Extrasphincteric Fistula

**Pathophysiology**: Created when a **supralevator abscess is drained via the wrong route**:
- Intersphincteric origin drained through buttock skin → tract now traverses the entire sphincter complex from the supralevator space through the ischiorectal fossa to the skin → **extrasphincteric fistula** [4]
- This is a Parks Type IV fistula — the most difficult to manage, often requiring faecal diversion (colostomy) or even proctectomy [10]

This complication is **entirely preventable** by determining the origin of the supralevator abscess before choosing the drainage route.

#### 2.6 False Passage Creation During Fistula Probing

**Pathophysiology**: At EUA, a fistula probe is passed through the tract to identify the internal opening. If too much force is applied, the probe can perforate the tract wall → creates a **false passage** — a new, iatrogenic tract through healthy tissue (potentially through the sphincter) [5].

**Prevention**: Gentle probing; never force the probe; use malleable probes; consider hydrogen peroxide injection or MRI to map the tract before probing.

### 3. Complications Related to Underlying Disease

When the anorectal abscess is secondary to an underlying condition (rather than simple cryptoglandular infection), additional complications may arise from the primary disease:

#### 3.1 Crohn's Disease — Perianal Complications

***Perianal disease*** in Crohn's can include [14]:
- ***Abscess*** — simple drainage [11]
- ***Fistula*** — simple (fistulotomy) or complex (***seton insertion for drainage, azathioprine, biologics, colostomy or proctectomy***) [11]
- **Anorectal stricture** — chronic inflammation → fibrosis → narrowing → obstructed defaecation
- **Skin tags** — large, oedematous, "elephant-ear" skin tags characteristic of Crohn's
- **Anal fissures** — often **off-midline, painless, multiple** (atypical features compared to primary fissures)
- **Rectovaginal fistula** — tract from the rectum to the vagina → passage of flatus/faeces through vagina

Perianal Crohn's disease is a marker of **aggressive, fistulising phenotype** and is an adverse prognostic factor that warrants **early introduction of immunomodulators and biologics** [14].

#### 3.2 Tuberculosis — Chronic Non-Healing Fistula

- TB-related perianal abscess may lead to a **chronic, non-healing fistula** with caseous discharge
- Failure to diagnose TB means ongoing active infection → repeated recurrence → complex fistula tracts → anal stenosis
- Requires **anti-TB therapy** (RIPE regimen) for cure; surgery alone will not resolve TB fistulas

#### 3.3 Malignancy — Missed Diagnosis

- An anorectal abscess may be the first presentation of **anal carcinoma** or **low rectal carcinoma**
- Tumour necrosis or obstruction of a crypt gland by tumour → secondary abscess
- If the abscess cavity wall is not biopsied, the underlying malignancy may be **missed**
- ***Colorectal neoplasm needs to be excluded*** [1]

| **Treatment** | Premature wound closure → recurrence | Moderate | Skin heals before deep cavity → trapped collection | De-roofing; daily wound care; packing |
| **Treatment** | Urinary retention | Common post-operatively | Reflex via pudendal nerve; anaesthesia; opioids | Adequate analgesia; early mobilisation; catheter if needed |
| **Treatment** | Iatrogenic extrasphincteric fistula | Rare but devastating | Wrong drainage route for supralevator abscess | Determine abscess origin before drainage |
| **Treatment** | False passage | Rare | Forceful fistula probing | Gentle probing; MRI guidance |
| **Underlying disease** | Crohn's perianal complications | In Crohn's patients | Transmural inflammation, fistulising phenotype | Biologics; seton; multidisciplinary management |
| **Underlying disease** | Missed malignancy | Rare | Tumour → secondary abscess; no biopsy taken | Biopsy abscess wall if atypical; colonoscopy |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Anorectal Abscess">

**1. Fistula-in-ano** is the most common complication (30–50%). It represents the chronic phase of the cryptoglandular process — a persistent tract from the internal opening (crypt) to the external opening (skin). Predicted by gut flora on pus culture. Managed by fistulotomy (simple) or seton + sphincter-sparing procedures (complex).

**2. Recurrence** occurs in 10–30% if the internal opening is not addressed. Reduced by primary fistulotomy for simple fistulas and treating underlying causes.

**3. Necrotising fasciitis (Fournier's gangrene)** is the most feared complication — life-threatening, 20–40% mortality. High risk in DM and immunosuppression. Requires emergency debridement + broad-spectrum antibiotics + ICU care.

**4. Faecal incontinence** is the most important surgical complication — caused by sphincter damage from fistulotomy or incorrect drainage route. Prevented by correct surgical approach and sphincter-sparing techniques.

**5. Always biopsy the abscess wall if atypical** — to exclude Crohn's disease, TB, and malignancy.
