## Diagnostic Criteria, Diagnostic Algorithm & Investigation Modalities

### 1. Diagnostic Criteria

Anorectal abscess does **not** have formal diagnostic criteria in the way that, say, rheumatoid arthritis or SLE does. It is fundamentally a **clinical diagnosis** — you diagnose it by recognising the characteristic history and examination findings [1][2][4]. That said, we can define what constitutes a positive diagnosis:

#### 1.1 Clinical Diagnostic Criteria (Practical Framework)

A diagnosis of anorectal abscess is made when **ALL** of the following are present:

| Criterion | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **1. Compatible symptoms** | ***Pain*** (constant, throbbing, perianal/anorectal), ± ***swelling***, ± ***drainage***, ± ***constipation***, ± ***urinary difficulties*** [1] |
| **2. Compatible signs on examination** | ***Erythematous, fluctuant, tender mass*** on inspection and/or DRE [4]; or a tender boggy mass palpable within the anal canal (intersphincteric) or above the anorectal ring (supralevator) |
| **3. Collection of pus confirmed** | Either by clinical fluctuance, aspiration of pus, imaging (MRI/CT/EUS showing a fluid collection), or at the time of incision and drainage |

For **superficial abscesses** (perianal, most ischiorectal): the diagnosis is almost entirely clinical — you see it, you feel it, you drain it. No imaging is typically needed.

For **deep-seated abscesses** (intersphincteric, supralevator): the diagnosis may require additional investigation because there are **no visible external signs** — you rely on DRE findings and imaging.

<Callout title="Key Principle: Anorectal Abscess is a Clinical Diagnosis">
***Diagnosis can be usually made by careful history and examination*** [1]. The overwhelming majority of perianal and ischiorectal abscesses are diagnosed at the bedside. Reserve imaging (MRI, CT, EUS) for cases where the abscess is **not palpable**, is **deep-seated**, is **recurrent**, or when you suspect **complex pathology** (Crohn's, fistula, malignancy) [2].
</Callout>

#### 1.2 When to Suspect an Anorectal Abscess (Clinical Triggers)

Think of this as the "screening criteria" — features that should make you actively look for an anorectal abscess:

- **Any patient** with constant perianal pain, especially if worsened by sitting and not relieved by defaecation
- **Any patient** with perianal swelling, redness, or warmth
- **Any patient** with fever of unknown origin + perianal symptoms (even vague rectal discomfort) — especially if immunocompromised
- **Any patient** with unexplained urinary retention + perianal/rectal pain
- **Immunocompromised patients** (DM, HIV, chemotherapy, neutropaenia) with perianal symptoms — low threshold for imaging, as clinical signs may be attenuated (reduced inflammatory response → less erythema, less fluctuance, yet the abscess may be large)

<Callout title="Immunocompromised Patients — Beware" type="error">
In neutropaenic or severely immunosuppressed patients, the classical signs of abscess (erythema, fluctuance, warmth) may be **absent or minimal** because the inflammatory response is blunted. These patients may present only with vague perianal pain and fever. Maintain a very low threshold for imaging (MRI pelvis) and examination under anaesthesia (EUA). Delayed diagnosis → necrotising soft tissue infection → mortality.
</Callout>

### 2. Diagnostic Algorithm

The algorithm follows a systematic approach: **History → Examination → Bedside assessment → Targeted investigations → Definitive management**. The branching points depend on whether the abscess is clinically obvious or occult.

    P -->|No| R["Standard cryptoglandular<br/>abscess → routine follow-up<br/>• Watch for fistula at 6-12 weeks"]
```

> The algorithm emphasises that **most anorectal abscesses are diagnosed clinically and treated surgically without delay**. Investigations are reserved for deep, occult, recurrent, or atypical cases. The mantra is: ***"If there is pus, let it out"*** — do not delay drainage waiting for imaging in an obvious abscess.

### 3. Investigation Modalities

***Investigations*** serve three distinct purposes [1]:
1. ***Help in the diagnosis and assess the severity of disease***
2. ***Define anatomy of the pathological process (abscess and fistula)***
3. ***Exclude diseases in the proximal bowel and associated bowel problems (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease)***

Let us organise investigations into **bedside**, **laboratory**, **imaging**, and **endoscopic/procedural**, explaining **why** each is done, **what** you expect to find, and **how** to interpret the results.

---

#### 3.1 Bedside Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Key Findings & Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Inspection of perianal region** | Identify superficial abscess, external fistula openings, skin tags, fissures, scars | **Erythematous, fluctuant, tender swelling** at anal verge = perianal abscess. Diffuse buttock swelling/induration = ischiorectal abscess. Dimple of granulation tissue with discharge = external fistula opening. |
| **Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)** | Assess for deep abscess (intersphincteric, supralevator); evaluate sphincter tone; palpate for masses | ***Abscess can be felt in DRE if there is no findings on physical inspection*** [2]. Tender boggy mass in the anal canal wall = intersphincteric abscess. Tender fullness above the anorectal ring = supralevator abscess. Hard, fixed, irregular mass = suspect malignancy. Reduced sphincter tone may indicate prior surgery or neurological cause. |
| **Proctoscopy / Anoscopy** | Visualise the anal canal mucosa; identify inflamed crypt (internal opening); rule out co-existing pathology (haemorrhoids, fissure, tumour) | Inflamed, oedematous crypt at the dentate line = probable source. Purulent discharge from a crypt on gentle compression = confirms internal opening. May be too painful to perform in the acute setting → defer to EUA. |
| **Assessment of vital signs** | Detect systemic sepsis | Tachycardia, fever ( > 38°C), hypotension → suggests significant infection; may need resuscitation before theatre. In severe cases, consider Fournier's gangrene (necrotising fasciitis). |

<Callout title="DRE — The Most Important Bedside Investigation" type="idea">
Never skip the DRE. An intersphincteric abscess is diagnosed **only** by DRE (or EUA) — it has no external signs. A supralevator abscess may also be first detected as a tender fullness on DRE. If the patient is in too much pain for bedside DRE, this itself is a strong indication for **EUA** in theatre.
</Callout>

---

#### 3.2 Laboratory Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Key Findings & Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Full blood count (CBC/FBC)** | Assess for infection and its severity | **Leucocytosis with neutrophilia** = active bacterial infection. The WCC magnitude correlates loosely with severity. **Neutropaenia** in a chemotherapy patient = high risk of atypical presentation and fulminant sepsis — very low threshold for aggressive management. |
| **C-reactive protein (CRP)** | Quantify systemic inflammatory response; monitor response to treatment | **Elevated CRP** ( > 10 mg/L) supports active infection. Very high CRP ( > 100) raises concern for deep-seated collection or necrotising infection. Useful for serial monitoring after drainage — should trend downward. |
| **Blood glucose / HbA1c** | Screen for diabetes mellitus | **Elevated glucose/HbA1c** = previously undiagnosed or poorly controlled DM — a major risk factor for complicated perianal sepsis, poor wound healing, and necrotising fasciitis. Optimise glycaemic control perioperatively. |
| **Blood cultures** | Identify bacteraemia in systemically septic patients | Obtain **before** starting antibiotics if fever > 38°C, rigors, tachycardia, or hypotension. Positive blood cultures guide targeted antibiotic therapy. Most common isolates: *E. coli*, *Bacteroides fragilis*, *Enterococcus*. |
| **Pus culture and sensitivity (C/ST)** | Identify causative organisms; **predict fistula risk** | ***Culture shows skin flora: no fistula → reassurance. Culture shows gut flora: likely with fistula → treat as fistula after acute state*** [4]. Always send at time of I&D. **Gut flora** (*E. coli*, *Bacteroides*, *Enterococcus*) = internal communication with bowel lumen = **high fistula risk (~50%)**. **Skin flora only** (*Staph. aureus*, *Streptococcus*) = no internal communication = **low fistula risk**. **AFB positive** = TB — send for culture (takes 6–8 weeks). **Sulfur granules** = Actinomycosis. |
| **Pus for AFB stain + TB culture** | Exclude tuberculosis (especially in Hong Kong) | Indicated if: non-healing abscess, caseous material, chronic/recurrent perianal sepsis, patient from TB-endemic area. **AFB positive on Ziehl-Neelsen stain** = TB. Culture on Löwenstein-Jensen medium takes 6–8 weeks but is definitive. Consider TB-PCR (GeneXpert) for rapid result. |
| **Tissue biopsy (abscess wall)** | Exclude Crohn's disease, TB, malignancy | Sent at time of I&D if atypical features. **Non-caseating granulomas** = Crohn's. **Caseating granulomas** = TB. **Dysplasia/malignant cells** = anal carcinoma. **Sulfur granules with filamentous organisms** = Actinomycosis. |
| **HIV test** | Screen for immunodeficiency | Consider in: recurrent perianal sepsis, atypical organisms, young patient with risk factors. HIV increases risk of perianal sepsis, atypical infections, and poor healing. |
| **Inflammatory markers for IBD** | Screen for Crohn's disease if suspected | **Faecal calprotectin** ( > 250 μg/g suggests active bowel inflammation); **CRP/ESR** elevated; **ASCA positive** (anti-*Saccharomyces cerevisiae* antibodies — more specific for Crohn's). These are adjuncts — definitive diagnosis requires colonoscopy + biopsy. |

<Callout title="Pus C/ST — The Underappreciated Investigation">
Many students forget the clinical significance of pus microbiology. It is not just about choosing the right antibiotic — **the type of organism predicts fistula formation**. Gut flora = fistula likely → plan for follow-up and possible fistula surgery. Skin flora = fistula unlikely → reassurance. This directly changes your management and counselling of the patient [4].
</Callout>

#### 3.3 Imaging Investigations

| Modality | Indication | Key Findings & Interpretation | Advantages & Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MRI Pelvis** | ***Non-palpable abscess*** [2]; deep-seated abscess (intersphincteric, supralevator); recurrent abscess; suspected complex fistula; perianal Crohn's disease | **T2-weighted / STIR sequences**: abscess appears as a **high-signal (bright) fluid collection** with surrounding oedema and rim enhancement on post-gadolinium T1. Fistula tracts appear as **linear high-signal tracks** on T2. Accurately maps the relationship of abscess/fistula to the sphincter complex and levator ani. Can identify **occult secondary tracts** and **horseshoe extensions** not apparent clinically. | **Gold standard** for perianal sepsis imaging. Excellent soft tissue resolution. Non-invasive. No radiation. **Limitations**: Expensive, time-consuming, may require sedation (claustrophobia), not universally available for emergency use. |
| **Endoanal Ultrasound (EUS)** | Alternative to MRI; can be performed in clinic or theatre; particularly useful for intersphincteric abscess | Abscess appears as a **hypoechoic (dark) fluid collection**. Can delineate the IAS, EAS, and intersphincteric plane with high resolution. Fistula tracts appear as hypoechoic linear tracks. Internal opening may be identified. | Good for imaging the sphincter complex and intersphincteric plane. **Limitations**: Operator-dependent; limited field of view (cannot assess supralevator space as well as MRI); may be painful in the acute setting. |
| **CT Pelvis** | If MRI unavailable; suspected supralevator abscess from intra-abdominal source (e.g., diverticular abscess, appendiceal abscess tracking down); to exclude pelvic pathology | Abscess appears as a **rim-enhancing hypodense fluid collection** with surrounding fat stranding. Can identify gas within the collection (concerning for gas-forming organisms / necrotising infection). Can assess the abdomen/pelvis simultaneously. | Fast acquisition (good for acutely unwell patients). Widely available. Good for excluding intra-abdominal sources. **Limitations**: Less soft tissue resolution than MRI for the sphincter complex and fistula tracts; radiation exposure; not first-line for perianal imaging. |
| **Fistulography** | Rarely used now; historical test for mapping fistula tracts | Contrast injected through external fistula opening → radiograph shows the tract. | Largely **superseded by MRI** which is non-invasive and provides superior anatomical detail. May still have a role in selected cases. |

> ***CT/MRI scan indicated in a non-palpable abscess*** [2]. Think of imaging as reserved for when your clinical examination cannot adequately define the problem.

#### 3.4 Endoscopic & Procedural Investigations

| Investigation | Indication | Key Findings & Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA)** | When bedside examination is too painful; to fully assess abscess extent; to probe for fistula tracts at time of I&D; to assess complex or recurrent perianal sepsis | **The definitive investigation for anorectal abscess.** Under GA/regional anaesthesia, the surgeon can: inspect the perianal region and anal canal thoroughly; perform DRE and proctoscopy without pain; incise and drain the abscess; probe the cavity to identify internal opening and fistula tracts (with caution — avoid creating false passages); assess sphincter integrity. EUA is both **diagnostic and therapeutic**. |
| **Proctoscopy / Rigid Sigmoidoscopy** | Visualise the anal canal and lower rectum; identify internal opening; exclude mucosal pathology | Inflamed crypt at dentate line (source). Purulent discharge from crypt on compression (internal opening identified). Mucosal ulceration, oedema, or nodularity may suggest IBD or malignancy. |
| **Flexible Sigmoidoscopy / Colonoscopy** | ***Exclude diseases in the proximal bowel and associated bowel problems (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease)*** [1] | Indicated when: recurrent/atypical perianal sepsis, young patient with GI symptoms (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss), suspicion of Crohn's disease, or to exclude colorectal malignancy. **Findings in Crohn's**: skip lesions, aphthous ulcers, cobblestoning, strictures, non-caseating granulomas on biopsy. **Findings in malignancy**: mass, ulcerated lesion, obstruction. |
| **Fistula probing (at EUA)** | Identify the course and complexity of an associated fistula | A malleable probe is gently passed through the external opening → follows the tract → emerges at the internal opening. Identifies the **internal opening** (usually at the dentate line at the site of the infected crypt). Determines if the fistula is **simple** (intersphincteric/low transsphincteric — < 30% EAS involvement) or **complex** (high transsphincteric, suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric, multiple tracts, Crohn's-related). **Perform with extreme caution** to avoid creating a false passage [5]. |
| **Goodsall's rule application (at EUA)** | Predict the location of the internal opening based on the position of the external opening | **Goodsall's rule**: External opening **anterior** to the transverse anal line → fistula tract runs in a **straight radial line** to the nearest crypt (internal opening directly opposite). External opening **posterior** to the transverse anal line → tract curves to the **posterior midline** crypt (internal opening at 6 o'clock in lithotomy position). **Exceptions**: anterior external openings > 3 cm from the anal verge may still curve posteriorly. Crohn's fistulas often do not follow this rule. |

<Callout title="Goodsall's Rule — A Useful but Imperfect Guide" type="idea">
Goodsall's rule helps predict where the internal opening of a fistula is located, which is critical for surgical planning. However, it is a guideline, not a law. Complex fistulas (especially Crohn's-related) frequently violate this rule. MRI is superior for mapping complex tracts.

#### 3.5 Summary of Investigations — When and Why

| Clinical Scenario | Investigations Needed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Obvious perianal/ischiorectal abscess, first episode, otherwise healthy** | FBC, CRP, blood glucose; pus C/ST at I&D; EUA for drainage and fistula assessment | Straightforward case — clinical diagnosis, surgical treatment, send pus to predict fistula risk |
| **Deep abscess suspected (no external signs, severe pain)** | As above + **MRI pelvis** (or EUS) before or concurrent with EUA | ***MRI indicated in a non-palpable abscess*** [2] — define anatomy before choosing drainage route (especially supralevator) |
| **Recurrent perianal abscess** | As above + MRI pelvis + colonoscopy + biopsy of abscess wall + AFB stain + HIV test | ***Exclude diseases in proximal bowel*** [1] — specifically Crohn's disease and TB; HIV testing for immunodeficiency |
| **Immunocompromised patient (DM, HIV, neutropaenia)** | As above + blood cultures + low threshold for MRI + aggressive monitoring | Attenuated clinical signs; higher risk of necrotising infection; blood cultures essential as bacteraemia more likely |
| **Suspected Crohn's-related perianal sepsis** | MRI pelvis + colonoscopy with biopsies + inflammatory markers (faecal calprotectin, CRP) + EUA | Crohn's perianal disease requires combined medical (anti-TNF) and surgical management; MRI maps complex fistula anatomy |
| **Atypical/non-healing abscess — malignancy suspected** | Biopsy of abscess cavity wall + MRI pelvis + colonoscopy + inguinal LN assessment (USS ± FNA) | Exclude anal carcinoma or rectal carcinoma with secondary abscess |

### 4. Interpretation Framework — Putting It All Together

When you receive investigation results, interpret them systematically:

| Finding | Interpretation | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| **Pus C/ST: gut flora** | Internal communication with bowel → **fistula likely** [4] | Plan follow-up at 6–12 weeks; if persistent discharge → MRI + EUA for fistula assessment |
| **Pus C/ST: skin flora only** | No internal communication → **fistula unlikely** [4] | Reassurance; routine wound follow-up |
| **Pus AFB positive** | **Tuberculosis** | Start anti-TB therapy (RIPE regimen); tissue biopsy for confirmation; check CXR and sputum |
| **Biopsy: non-caseating granulomas** | **Crohn's disease** | Colonoscopy; gastroenterology referral; consider anti-TNF therapy |
| **Biopsy: caseating granulomas** | **Tuberculosis** | Anti-TB therapy |
| **Biopsy: dysplasia/malignant cells** | **Anal carcinoma** | Staging (MRI pelvis, CT TAP); MDT discussion; chemoradiation |
| **MRI: rim-enhancing collection in intersphincteric plane** | **Intersphincteric abscess** | Drain transanally at EUA |
| **MRI: collection above levator ani** | **Supralevator abscess** — determine origin | If from intersphincteric extension → drain transanally. If from ischiorectal extension → drain via buttock skin. If from pelvic source → treat abdominal pathology. |
| **MRI: complex branching tracts with multiple collections** | **Complex fistula** (likely Crohn's or recurrent cryptoglandular) | Seton drainage; consider anti-TNF if Crohn's; staged surgical approach |
| **Blood cultures positive** | **Bacteraemia/sepsis** | Targeted IV antibiotics based on sensitivities; ensure adequate source control (drainage) |
| **HbA1c > 6.5% / Blood glucose elevated** | **Diabetes mellitus** | Glycaemic optimisation; higher risk of wound complications — closer follow-up |
| **Leucopaenia/neutropaenia** | **Immunosuppressed** — attenuated clinical signs | Low threshold for imaging and EUA; broad-spectrum antibiotics; close monitoring |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Diagnosis of Anorectal Abscess">

**1. Clinical diagnosis is the cornerstone.** Most perianal and ischiorectal abscesses are diagnosed by history (constant perianal pain, swelling, discharge) and examination (erythematous fluctuant tender mass).

**2. DRE is essential.** An intersphincteric abscess has no visible external signs — only DRE (tender boggy mass in anal canal wall) can detect it. Supralevator abscess may also be detected as tenderness above the anorectal ring.

**3. Imaging (MRI gold standard) is reserved for:** non-palpable abscess, deep-seated abscess, recurrent abscess, suspected complex fistula, and Crohn's disease.

**4. Always send pus C/ST at I&D.** Gut flora = fistula likely; skin flora = fistula unlikely.

**5. Investigate for underlying cause if atypical:** Crohn's (colonoscopy), TB (AFB stain), malignancy (biopsy), HIV (serology).

**6. Three purposes of investigations:** (i) diagnose and assess severity, (ii) define anatomy, (iii) exclude proximal bowel disease.
