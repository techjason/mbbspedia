## Complications of Volvulus

Complications of volvulus can be organised into three temporal categories: (1) **complications of the volvulus itself** (i.e., what happens if it is not treated or treatment is delayed), (2) **complications of treatment** (endoscopic and surgical), and (3) **long-term sequelae**. Each complication flows logically from the underlying pathophysiology — the twist, the ischaemia, the surgery, or the recovery.

---

### 1. Complications of Volvulus Itself (Pre-Treatment / Delayed Treatment)

These complications arise from the fundamental pathophysiology of volvulus: **closed-loop obstruction + mesenteric vascular occlusion**. They follow a predictable cascade of escalating severity.

#### 1.1 Strangulation (Bowel Ischaemia → Necrosis)

> ***Blood supply is compromised when bowel dilation is excessive. Bowel becomes ischaemic and leads to necrosis or perforation.*** [3]

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | The twisted mesentery compresses veins first (low pressure), then arteries. Continued arterial inflow with obstructed venous outflow causes venous congestion → bowel wall oedema → haemorrhagic infarction → transmural necrosis. Additionally, ***increased intraluminal pressure*** within the closed loop directly compresses mural vessels, and the ***interrupted mesenteric blood flow*** from the twist compounds the insult [3]. |
| **Why volvulus is particularly dangerous** | Because it is a **closed-loop obstruction**, the trapped segment cannot decompress. Intraluminal pressure rises far more rapidly than in simple obstruction, accelerating the vascular compromise. |
| ***Causes of strangulation*** | ***↑ Intraluminal pressure; Direct pressure on bowel wall; Interrupted mesenteric blood flow*** [3] |
| ***Features suggestive of strangulation*** | **Clinical (Signs):** ***Fever, Tachycardia, Peritoneal signs*** (guarding, rigidity, rebound). **Clinical (Symptoms):** ***Continuous or worsening abdominal pain*** (colicky pain becomes constant as ischaemia sets in). **Biochemical:** ***Leukocytosis, Metabolic acidosis*** (lactic). **Radiological:** ***Pneumoperitoneum, Pneumatosis intestinalis, Portal venous gas*** [3]. |
| **Prognosis** | ***Morbidity and mortality are dependent on duration of ischaemia and its extent. Any length of ischaemic bowel can cause significant systemic effects secondary to sepsis and dehydration*** [3]. |

<Callout title="Strangulation — The Core Complication" type="error">
Strangulation is not a separate diagnosis from volvulus — it is the **inevitable consequence** of untreated volvulus. Every volvulus will progress to strangulation if the twist is not relieved. The clinical question is always: "Has this volvulus already strangulated?" If the answer is yes, the patient goes to theatre immediately. If the answer is not yet, you have a window for endoscopic decompression (sigmoid) or planned surgery (caecal).

#### 1.2 Bowel Perforation → Peritonitis

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Transmural necrosis weakens the bowel wall → the ischaemic, gangrenous wall ruptures under the rising intraluminal pressure → luminal contents (faeces, gas, bacteria) spill into the peritoneal cavity → **faecal peritonitis**. |
| **Why this is catastrophic** | Faecal peritonitis carries a mortality of 30–50% in elderly patients. The peritoneal cavity is flooded with enteric bacteria (E. coli, Bacteroides, Enterococcus) and bacterial endotoxin → massive systemic inflammatory response → septic shock → multi-organ failure. |
| **Clinical features** | Sudden worsening of abdominal pain → board-like rigidity of the abdomen; signs of septic shock (hypotension, tachycardia, fever or hypothermia, altered consciousness). ***Peritonitis*** from ***intestinal perforation due to volvulus*** [3]. |
| **Radiological signs** | ***Pneumoperitoneum*** (free gas under diaphragm on erect CXR/AXR); ***Rigler sign*** (double-wall sign — both sides of the bowel wall outlined by gas) [3]. |

#### 1.3 Sepsis and Septic Shock

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Even before frank perforation, bacterial translocation occurs through the ischaemic, permeable bowel wall → bacteria and endotoxin enter the mesenteric venous system → portal circulation → systemic bacteraemia. Once perforation occurs, the bacterial load multiplies enormously. |
| **Clinical features** | ***Shock (Haemodynamic instability)*** — ***Septic shock due to bowel necrosis*** [3]. SIRS criteria → sepsis → septic shock (hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors). |
| **Multi-organ failure** | Septic shock triggers a cascade: acute kidney injury (renal hypoperfusion), ARDS (pulmonary capillary leak), DIC (consumptive coagulopathy), hepatic failure → death. |

#### 1.4 Dehydration, Hypovolaemia, and Electrolyte Disturbance

> ***Complications — Systemic: dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, aspiration pneumonia*** [13]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Dehydration / hypovolaemia** | Reduced oral intake + vomiting + third-space fluid sequestration into dilated bowel lumen and peritoneal cavity → intravascular volume depletion → pre-renal AKI, haemodynamic instability. ***Hypovolaemia due to dehydration or third-space loss*** [3]. |
| **Hypokalaemia** | Direct K⁺ loss in vomitus + metabolic alkalosis driving K⁺ intracellularly + RAAS activation → renal K⁺ wasting. Dangerous because hypokalaemia causes cardiac arrhythmias and paralytic ileus (worsening the obstruction). |
| **Hyponatraemia** | Na⁺ loss in vomitus + third-space losses. |
| **Metabolic alkalosis** | Loss of gastric HCl from vomiting → net gain of HCO₃⁻. |
| **Metabolic acidosis (lactic)** | Bowel ischaemia → anaerobic glycolysis → lactate accumulation; hypovolaemia → systemic hypoperfusion. May co-exist with alkalosis (mixed picture). |

#### 1.5 Aspiration Pneumonia

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Massive proximal bowel distension → retrograde flow of intestinal contents into the stomach → vomiting of large volumes of faeculent or bilious fluid → aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree. Particularly dangerous in obtunded patients (elderly, neuropsychiatric patients, sedated patients). |
| **Clinical features** | Fever, cough, tachypnoea, hypoxia, crackles on auscultation. CXR shows infiltrates (typically right lower lobe due to anatomy of right main bronchus). |
| **Prevention** | ***NG tube decompression*** (drip and suck) is a key early intervention — by keeping the stomach empty, you dramatically reduce aspiration risk [3]. |

#### 1.6 Recurrence

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Sigmoid volvulus** | ***Recurrence after endoscopic decompression is approximately 50%*** [1]. The underlying problem (redundant sigmoid with narrow mesenteric attachment) is not corrected by decompression alone. Each recurrence carries the full risk of ischaemia and gangrene. |
| **Caecal volvulus** | ***Colonoscopic derotation ± caecopexy has high recurrence*** [2]. This is why right hemicolectomy (which removes the mobile caecum entirely) is the definitive treatment. |
| **Prevention** | Elective sigmoidectomy for sigmoid volvulus; right hemicolectomy for caecal volvulus. |

### 2. Complications of Treatment

#### 2.1 Complications of Endoscopic Decompression (Sigmoidoscopy)

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Bowel perforation during procedure** | Excessive insufflation of gas into an already compromised, thinned bowel wall → perforation. This is why the procedure requires ***cautious insufflation*** [2]. Also, advancing the scope through necrotic mucosa can tear the bowel wall. | Immediate emergency laparotomy for source control |
| **Failed reduction** | The twist is too tight, or extensive oedema prevents the scope from passing the torsion point. Occurs in ~20–30% of attempts. | Proceed to emergency surgery |
| **Incomplete assessment of viability** | Endoscopy can only visualise the luminal mucosa — it cannot assess the serosal surface or mesentery. Mucosa may appear deceptively viable while the outer wall is gangrenous. | Maintain high index of suspicion; monitor closely post-decompression with serial AXR, lactate, clinical exam. Any deterioration → laparotomy. |
| **Recurrence** (see above) | The decompression treats the acute event but not the underlying anatomical predisposition. | Elective sigmoidectomy in appropriate candidates |

#### 2.2 Complications of Surgery (General Post-Operative)

| Complication | Mechanism | Relevance to Volvulus |
|---|---|---|
| **Anastomotic leak** | The join between the two bowel ends fails to heal → faecal contents leak into the peritoneal cavity → peritonitis, sepsis. Risk factors include: emergency surgery, unprepared bowel, poor blood supply to anastomotic ends, patient malnutrition, steroid use, haemodynamic instability. | Particularly relevant when primary anastomosis is performed in the emergency setting for volvulus. This is why Hartmann's procedure (no anastomosis) is preferred in unstable or contaminated settings [2]. |
| **Wound infection / Surgical site infection** | Contamination of the wound with faecal/enteric organisms during emergency surgery on unprepared bowel. | Higher risk in emergency volvulus surgery than elective surgery due to faecal contamination |
| **Post-operative ileus** | Any abdominal surgery temporarily disrupts bowel motility. The myenteric plexus is inhibited by surgical handling, inflammation, and opioid analgesia. | Monitor for return of bowel function (passage of flatus/stool). |
| **Intra-abdominal abscess** | Collection of infected fluid in the peritoneal cavity post-operatively, especially if there was faecal contamination or an anastomotic leak. | Presents as persistent fever, raised WCC, failure to progress. Diagnosed by CT; managed by percutaneous drainage + antibiotics. |
| ***Adhesive small bowel obstruction*** | Any abdominal surgery creates adhesions (fibrous bands between organs/peritoneum). These can cause future bowel obstruction. ***Small bowel obstruction from adhesions*** is listed as a complication of the Ladd procedure [3]. | A known long-term risk of any intra-abdominal surgery. Risk is higher after emergency surgery with contamination/inflammation. |

#### 2.3 Complications Specific to Hartmann's Procedure

> ***Specific complications: Rectal stump leak, abscess, fistula; Ureter injury; Stoma complications*** [2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Rectal stump leak / abscess / fistula*** | The closed rectal stump can break down, especially in the setting of inflammation and poor tissue quality, leading to pelvic abscess or fistula formation. |
| ***Ureteric injury*** | The left ureter runs in close proximity to the sigmoid mesocolon. During emergency surgery with inflamed, distorted anatomy, the ureter can be inadvertently divided, ligated, or cauterised. |
| ***Stoma complications*** | Includes: parastomal hernia (weakness in abdominal wall around stoma), stoma prolapse (bowel protrudes excessively), stoma retraction (stoma sinks below skin level), skin excoriation (irritant output damages peristomal skin), stoma stenosis (narrowing of the stoma opening), high-output stoma (especially ileostomy → dehydration and electrolyte losses). |
| **Non-reversal of stoma** | Up to 30–40% of Hartmann's procedures are never reversed, particularly in elderly, frail patients. The patient lives permanently with a colostomy. |

#### 2.4 Complications Specific to the Ladd Procedure (Neonatal)

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Small bowel obstruction from adhesions*** [3] | Adhesions are inevitable after any laparotomy; in neonates, the relatively small abdominal cavity increases the chance that adhesive bands will kink a small bowel loop. | Recurrent vomiting, abdominal distension in a child with a history of Ladd procedure → suspect adhesive SBO |
| ***Short bowel syndrome (if resection is necessary when necrotic bowel is present)*** [3][7] | If midgut volvulus causes extensive necrosis requiring massive small bowel resection, the child is left with insufficient absorptive surface. | Defined by functional malabsorption of macronutrients and micronutrients. |
| **Recurrent volvulus post-Ladd procedure** | Rare (~2–5%) but possible, particularly after laparoscopic Ladd procedure (fewer adhesions form → less fixation of bowel in non-rotation position). | Presents with bilious vomiting again → urgent re-evaluation |

### 3. Short Bowel Syndrome — The Most Devastating Long-Term Complication of Midgut Volvulus

This deserves special attention because it is the single most feared consequence of neonatal midgut volvulus and is explicitly highlighted in the lecture slides.

> ***Complications of extensive small bowel resection — short bowel syndrome: Malabsorption; TPN-related cholestasis, liver failure; Central line sepsis; Long-term quality of life? Most are premature infants — complications of prematurity*** [7]

#### 3.1 What Is Short Bowel Syndrome?

Short bowel syndrome (SBS) is a **state of functional intestinal insufficiency** following massive bowel resection, where the remaining intestine cannot absorb sufficient nutrients, fluids, and electrolytes to maintain health without supplementation. In children, the most common cause is midgut volvulus [3].

#### 3.2 Complications of SBS (and Its Treatment)

| Complication | Mechanism | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ***Malabsorption*** [7] | Reduced absorptive surface area → insufficient digestion and absorption of macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements) | The small bowel is where the vast majority of nutrient absorption occurs. Loss of jejunum → carbohydrate/protein malabsorption. Loss of ileum → bile salt and B₁₂ malabsorption (the ileum is the only site for bile salt reabsorption and B₁₂ absorption). |
| ***TPN-related cholestasis → liver failure*** [7] | Patients with SBS require long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN). TPN bypasses the gut, reducing enteral stimulation of bile flow → cholestasis (bile stagnation in liver) → progressive liver fibrosis → cirrhosis → liver failure. TPN components (lipid emulsions, glucose) may also be directly hepatotoxic. | This is the leading cause of death in children with SBS on long-term TPN. "Intestinal failure-associated liver disease" (IFALD). |
| ***Central line sepsis*** [7] | TPN is delivered through a central venous catheter (e.g., Hickman line, PICC). Long-term central venous access carries a continuous risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) from skin flora (Staph epidermidis, Staph aureus) or gut organisms. | Each episode of line sepsis risks metastatic infection (endocarditis, osteomyelitis) and loss of venous access sites. Eventually, patients "run out of veins." |
| ***Long-term quality of life*** [7] | Life tethered to IV infusions (TPN typically 12–18 hours/day); recurrent hospitalisations for sepsis, dehydration, metabolic crises; growth and developmental delay in children; psychological impact. | A devastating chronic condition that affects every aspect of life. |
| ***Complications of prematurity*** [7] | ***Most are premature infants*** — they carry the additional burden of prematurity-related complications (retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular haemorrhage, developmental delay). | The neonatal midgut volvulus patient often starts life at a significant disadvantage. |
| **D-lactic acidosis** | Unabsorbed carbohydrates reach the colon → bacterial fermentation produces D-lactate → systemic absorption → encephalopathy (confusion, ataxia, slurred speech). | Unusual metabolic complication of SBS with intact colon. Standard lactate assays measure L-lactate; must specifically request D-lactate. |
| **Oxalate kidney stones** | Unabsorbed fatty acids bind calcium in the gut lumen → reduced calcium available to bind oxalate → free oxalate is absorbed from the colon → hyperoxaluria → calcium oxalate renal stones. | Occurs specifically when the colon is in continuity (provides the absorptive surface for free oxalate). |

<Callout title="Why Is Prevention of Short Bowel Syndrome So Critical in Neonatal Surgery?">
Once the midgut is gangrenous and resected, you cannot get it back. There is no artificial replacement for the small bowel that matches its absorptive capacity. Intestinal transplantation exists but carries enormous risks (rejection, infection, graft-versus-host disease) and limited availability. This is why the neonatal surgical mantra is ***"time is essence"*** [4][6] — early surgery before gangrene sets in preserves bowel and prevents SBS. And even when gangrene is found, ***segments with questionable viability should be preserved*** [3] — resect only what is clearly dead, consider second-look laparotomy.
