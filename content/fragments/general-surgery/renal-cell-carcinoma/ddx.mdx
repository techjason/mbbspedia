## Differential Diagnosis of a Renal Mass

When you encounter a renal mass — whether discovered incidentally on imaging, found during a haematuria workup, or detected because the patient has flank pain — you must think systematically. Not every renal mass is RCC. The differential is broad, and getting it wrong has major consequences: you don't want to do a radical nephrectomy for a lymphoma (which is treated with chemotherapy) or panic about a simple cyst.

The approach is to ask **three sequential questions**:

1. **Is this mass real?** (Artefact, normal variant, pseudotumour such as a prominent column of Bertin)
2. **Is it cystic or solid?** (Simple cysts are overwhelmingly benign; solid masses are malignant until proven otherwise)
3. **If solid or complex cystic — is it benign or malignant?**

### Differential Diagnoses of Renal Masses — Detailed Breakdown

#### A. Benign Renal Masses

***Only ~20% of renal masses are benign*** [4]. Key benign differentials:

| Diagnosis | Key Features | Why It Mimics RCC | How to Distinguish |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ***Simple renal cyst*** | ***Asymptomatic, ovoid anechoic mass with smooth wall on USG*** [3] | Very common; large cysts may cause flank mass or pain | **Bosniak I–II criteria**: thin wall, no septations, no enhancement, no calcification. Requires **no follow-up** |
| ***Angiomyolipoma (AML)*** | ***Fat attenuation, enhancing without calcification on CT; associated with tuberous sclerosis complex*** [3] | Can be large, cause pain, and even rupture/haemorrhage (especially if > 4 cm) | **Macroscopic fat on CT** (Hounsfield units < −20 HU) is virtually diagnostic. Contains fat + smooth muscle + blood vessels ("angio-myo-lipoma" = vessels-muscle-fat). Risk of spontaneous haemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) if > 4 cm → embolisation or surgery |
| ***Oncocytoma*** | ***Homogeneous, well-circumscribed solid mass*** [3]; characteristically has a **central stellate scar** on CT | Solid, enhancing mass that looks identical to chromophobe RCC on imaging | **Cannot reliably distinguish from chromophobe RCC on imaging alone** — often requires histological confirmation. Composed of oncocytes (eosinophilic, mitochondria-rich cells). Benign — no metastatic potential |
| ***Infectious mass (renal abscess, focal pyelonephritis, xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis)*** | ***Often associated with signs/symptoms of UTI and systemic upset*** [3] | Can appear as an enhancing renal mass with irregular walls | **Clinical context**: fever, leucocytosis, pyuria, raised CRP/procalcitonin. XGP classically mimics RCC and is only diagnosed post-nephrectomy |
| **Renal pseudotumour** (hypertrophied column of Bertin, dromedary hump, foetal lobulation) | Normal anatomical variant of renal parenchyma | Can appear as a "mass" on USG | Enhances identically to surrounding normal cortex on CT; no distortion of architecture |
| **Complex renal cyst** | Cystic lesion with septations, calcifications, or wall thickening | Bosniak III–IV cysts have significant malignancy risk (Bosniak IV ≈ 100%) | **Bosniak classification** determines management (see below) |

<Callout title="Bosniak Classification of Renal Cysts — Quick Reference">

| Category | Features | Malignancy Risk | Management |
|----------|----------|----------------|------------|
| I | Simple: thin wall, no septa, no calcification, no enhancement | ~0% | No follow-up |
| II | Few thin septa, fine calcification, hyperdense cysts (< 3 cm), no enhancement | ~0% | No follow-up |
| IIF ("F" = follow-up) | More septa, minimally thickened; minimal enhancement; ≥ 3 cm hyperdense cysts | ~5% | Serial imaging |
| III | Thickened irregular walls/septa, measurable enhancement | ~50% | Surgery or biopsy |
| IV | Clearly enhancing soft tissue component | ~100% | Surgery (treat as RCC) |

</Callout>

<Callout title="Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis — The Great Mimicker" type="error">
XGP is a chronic destructive granulomatous infection (usually from *Proteus mirabilis* or *E. coli* with staghorn calculus) that destroys and replaces the renal parenchyma with lipid-laden macrophages. On CT it can look exactly like a locally advanced RCC (irregular mass, perinephric extension). It is often only diagnosed after nephrectomy when the pathologist finds granulomatous tissue instead of carcinoma. Clinical clue: usually occurs in middle-aged women with a history of recurrent UTIs and a non-functioning kidney on the affected side.
</Callout>

#### B. Malignant Renal Masses (Other Than RCC)

| Diagnosis | Key Features | Why It Matters | How to Distinguish from RCC |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| ***Urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis*** | Arises from transitional epithelium lining the renal pelvis (~8% of renal malignancies) [2][3] | Treated differently: **nephroureterectomy** (not radical nephrectomy alone), because the entire urothelial tract is at risk (field change) | Typically presents as a **central filling defect** in the renal pelvis on CT urogram (not a cortical mass). Often associated with **hydronephrosis**. Urine cytology may be positive. Risk factors: smoking, aristolochic acid (Chinese herbal nephropathy — important in Hong Kong), analgesic nephropathy |
| ***Renal metastasis*** | ***Usually multiple lesions with borderline enhancement + widespread metastatic disease*** [3] | Treatment is systemic (chemotherapy/immunotherapy), not surgical — so tissue diagnosis is critical | Common primaries that metastasise to kidney: **lung, breast, GIT, prostate, melanoma** [2]. Imaging: usually multiple, bilateral, small, minimally enhancing lesions in a patient with known primary cancer. ***Consider obtaining tissue biopsy if may affect management*** [3] |
| ***Lymphoma*** | Primary renal lymphoma is rare; secondary involvement more common (50% of lymphoma at autopsy have renal involvement) | Treatment is **chemotherapy**, NOT surgery — this is the critical distinction. Doing a nephrectomy for lymphoma is a disaster | Imaging: multiple bilateral homogeneous masses, or diffuse infiltration causing renomegaly without distortion of the collecting system. ***Consider obtaining tissue biopsy if may affect management*** [3]. Look for other evidence of lymphoma (lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, B symptoms) |
| ***Wilms' tumour (nephroblastoma)*** | Most common primary renal malignancy in **children** (< 15 years; peak age 3) [6] | Presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass in a child; different staging and treatment protocol from RCC | **Age is the key**: if a child has a renal mass, think Wilms' first. If an adult has a renal mass, think RCC first. Wilms' rarely crosses the midline (cf. neuroblastoma which does). Associated with WAGR syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, Denys-Drash syndrome [6] |
| ***Renal sarcoma*** | Rare (< 1%); includes leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, angiosarcoma | Highly aggressive with poor prognosis | Usually large, heterogeneous mass; tissue diagnosis needed |
| ***Collecting duct carcinoma*** | Arises from collecting ducts; ***rare, aggressive subtype with poor prognosis*** [5] | Behaves more like urothelial carcinoma than typical RCC; poor response to anti-VEGF therapy | Central (medullary) location rather than cortical; infiltrative pattern on CT |
| ***Renal medullary carcinoma*** | ***Very aggressive, mostly in young patients with sickle cell trait*** [5] | Nearly universally fatal; presents with metastatic disease | Young patient with sickle cell trait/disease + aggressive renal mass = pathognomonic |

---

#### C. Non-Neoplastic Conditions Mimicking a Renal Mass

| Condition | Key Features | How to Distinguish |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Renal abscess/perinephric abscess** | Fever, leucocytosis, pyuria; history of UTI or haematogenous seeding | CT shows rim-enhancing fluid collection ± gas; responds to antibiotics/drainage |
| **Renal infarct** | Wedge-shaped non-enhancing area; clinical context of AF, endocarditis, aortic disease | **Peripheral, wedge-shaped**, does not enhance; cortical rim sign (thin rim of viable subcapsular cortex) |
| **Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)** | Bilateral enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts | Family history, bilateral, large kidneys — but note: RCC can occur within ADPKD kidneys too |
| **Haematoma (subcapsular or perirenal)** | History of trauma, anticoagulation, or tumour bleed | CT shows high-density non-enhancing collection; may need follow-up to exclude underlying tumour |
| **Renal tuberculosis** | Chronic destructive granulomatous infection | "Putty kidney" (calcified non-functioning kidney); sterile pyuria; AFB on EMU; history of TB exposure |

### Key Differentiating Principles — Why the Distinction Matters

Let's think about **why** we care about the differential:

1. **RCC**: Treatment is primarily **surgical** (partial or radical nephrectomy). Anti-VEGF targeted therapy or immunotherapy for metastatic disease. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are largely **ineffective**.

2. **Urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis**: Requires **nephroureterectomy** (removing kidney + entire ureter + bladder cuff) because the entire urothelium is at risk from field cancerisation.

3. **Lymphoma / metastasis to kidney**: Treatment is **systemic** (chemotherapy/immunotherapy). Surgery would be inappropriate and harmful. This is why ***biopsy is indicated when lymphoma or metastasis is suspected*** [3] — in contrast to typical RCC where biopsy is generally avoided.

4. **Angiomyolipoma**: Benign. If small and asymptomatic, observation only. If > 4 cm or symptomatic, selective arterial embolisation or nephron-sparing surgery.

5. **Oncocytoma**: Benign. But since it cannot be reliably distinguished from chromophobe RCC on imaging, it often ends up being resected (and the diagnosis is made post-operatively by the pathologist).

<Callout title="When to Biopsy a Renal Mass" type="idea">
***CT-guided core biopsy is traditionally NOT done for suspected RCC*** due to risk of tumour seeding [3]. Instead, diagnosis is made from the **nephrectomy specimen** itself (surgery serves as both diagnosis and treatment).

***Indications for renal mass biopsy*** [3]:
- Renal mass of **unknown origin** (suspicious for metastasis, lymphoma, or non-malignant cause)
- **Metastatic disease** where the primary is uncertain and systemic therapy is planned
- Patient preference / unfit for surgery — to guide systemic therapy
- Before **thermal ablation** of a small renal mass

The key principle: you biopsy when the result would **change management** (e.g., if it's lymphoma → chemo, not surgery).

### Differential Diagnosis in Special Populations

#### Children (< 15 years)
- **Wilms' tumour** (most common — 95% of paediatric renal cancers) [6]
- Neuroblastoma (arises from adrenal/sympathetic chain, can appear as a suprarenal mass — differentiate with urine catecholamines: elevated VMA/HVA in neuroblastoma) [6]
- Mesoblastic nephroma (neonates — benign)
- Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney
- Rhabdoid tumour of the kidney (very aggressive; associated with hypercalcaemia) [6]

#### Young Adults (15–40 years)
- RCC (uncommon but possible)
- ***Translocation RCC (TFE3/TFEB)*** — ***usually affects children and young adults; distinct molecular pathology*** [5]
- ***Renal medullary carcinoma*** — ***very aggressive, mostly in young patients with sickle cell trait*** [5]
- AML (especially if TSC)

#### Adults with Known Malignancy
- Always consider **renal metastasis** from lung, breast, GIT, prostate, melanoma [2][3]
- Always consider **lymphoma** (especially if bilateral, homogeneous, with lymphadenopathy)

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Not all renal masses are RCC** — ~20% of renal masses are benign (angiomyolipoma, oncocytoma, simple cysts).
2. **Key imaging feature for AML**: macroscopic fat on CT (HU < −20). **Key imaging feature for oncocytoma**: central stellate scar — but cannot reliably distinguish from chromophobe RCC without histology.
3. **Bosniak classification** guides management of cystic renal masses: I–II = benign (no follow-up), IIF = follow-up, III = indeterminate (~50% malignant), IV = treat as malignant.
4. **Urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis** presents as a central filling defect (not a cortical mass) and requires nephroureterectomy, not nephrectomy alone.
5. **Lymphoma and renal metastasis** are treated with systemic therapy — biopsy is indicated to confirm before committing to chemotherapy.
6. ***CT-guided biopsy is traditionally NOT done for suspected RCC*** (risk of tumour seeding); it is reserved for when the result would change management (suspected lymphoma, metastasis, or non-malignant cause).
7. **In children**: think Wilms' tumour first; differentiate from neuroblastoma with urine catecholamines (VMA/HVA).
8. **In young adults with sickle cell trait**: think renal medullary carcinoma (very aggressive, nearly universally fatal).
9. **XGP** is the great mimicker of RCC — chronic granulomatous infection that often only gets diagnosed after nephrectomy.
