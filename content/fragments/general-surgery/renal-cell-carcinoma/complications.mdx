## Complications of Renal Cell Carcinoma

Complications of RCC can be divided into three broad categories: (A) complications of the disease itself (untreated or progressive), (B) complications of surgical treatment, and (C) complications of systemic therapy. Let's work through each systematically, always connecting back to the underlying mechanism.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

These are the consequences of the tumour growing, invading, metastasising, and secreting bioactive substances. Many of these overlap with the clinical features discussed earlier, but here we frame them as complications — i.e., things that cause morbidity and mortality.

#### 1.1 Local Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Ureteric/pelvicalyceal obstruction** | Tumour mass compresses or invades the renal pelvis or ureter → blocks urine drainage | Hydronephrosis → renal function decline on ipsilateral side; if bilateral (rare) or solitary kidney → obstructive renal failure. May present as flank pain |
| **Haemorrhage (spontaneous tumour bleed)** | RCC is one of the most **vascular** tumours (VHL loss → VEGF → abundant neovascularisation). Tumour vessels are fragile and lack normal smooth muscle → prone to spontaneous rupture | Retroperitoneal haemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome — though more classically associated with AML, RCC can also cause it); gross haematuria with clot retention; haemorrhagic shock (rare) |
| **Direct invasion into adjacent organs** | T4 disease — tumour invades beyond Gerota's fascia | Invasion into adrenal gland, liver (right-sided), spleen/pancreas tail (left-sided), diaphragm, psoas muscle, bowel |

#### 1.2 Venous Invasion Complications

This is the hallmark complication unique to RCC — the propensity to grow into the venous system as a **tumour thrombus**.

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| ***Left varicocele*** [1] | Left renal vein invasion → obstructs left gonadal vein outflow | Non-reducible left scrotal swelling; infertility (secondary to heat from varicocele) |
| ***Lower limb oedema*** [1] | IVC tumour thrombus → obstructed venous return from lower limbs | Bilateral leg swelling, may be massive |
| ***Ascites*** | IVC obstruction → hepatic vein congestion → Budd-Chiari-like picture → transudative ascites | Abdominal distension, shifting dullness |
| ***Pulmonary embolism*** [1] | Tumour thrombus fragments can detach and embolise to the pulmonary arteries — just like a DVT/PE but the "clot" is actually tumour | Sudden dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, cardiovascular collapse. Can be the presenting event and can be fatal |
| **Hepatic venous congestion / Budd-Chiari syndrome** | IVC tumour thrombus at or above the level of the hepatic veins → hepatic venous outflow obstruction | Hepatomegaly, RUQ pain, ascites, elevated LFTs, portal hypertension |

#### 1.3 Metastatic Complications

***25% of patients have advanced locoregional disease or distant metastasis at presentation*** [2]. The complications depend on the site of metastasis:

| ***Site*** | Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| ***Lung*** (most common) [2] | Respiratory failure, haemoptysis, pleural effusion, airway obstruction | Tumour replaces normal lung parenchyma; erosion into bronchial vasculature; lymphangitis carcinomatosis → severe dyspnoea [9] | Systemic therapy; palliative radiotherapy; pleurodesis for effusions; ***metastasectomy if oligometastatic*** [9] |
| ***Bone*** [2] | **Pathological fractures**, spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia, bone pain | RCC bone metastases are characteristically **lytic** (osteoclast-activating) and **highly vascular** — biopsy or even minor trauma can cause significant haemorrhage. Lytic destruction weakens the bone cortex → fracture with minimal force | Bisphosphonates/denosumab (inhibit osteoclast activity); orthopaedic stabilisation; palliative radiotherapy; decompressive surgery for cord compression |
| ***Brain*** [8] | Seizures, focal neurological deficits, raised ICP, cognitive dysfunction | Haematogenous spread → usually at grey-white junction (watershed areas where vessel calibre decreases, trapping tumour emboli) [8]. Surrounding vasogenic oedema causes mass effect | Dexamethasone (reduce oedema); AEDs if seizures; SRS/surgery for solitary operable lesions; WBRT for multiple lesions [8] |
| ***Liver*** [2] | Hepatic failure (late), RUQ pain, jaundice | Direct extension (right kidney) or haematogenous spread | Systemic therapy; rarely hepatic resection |
| **Adrenal** | Usually asymptomatic; rarely adrenal insufficiency | Contralateral adrenal metastasis (ipsilateral is by direct invasion = T4) | Systemic therapy; adrenalectomy if isolated |
| ***Choroid (eye)*** [10] | Visual loss, visual field defects | Haematogenous spread to the highly vascular choroid | Plaque radiotherapy or EBRT [10] |

<Callout title="Bone Metastases in RCC — A Haemorrhagic Hazard" type="error">
RCC bone metastases are uniquely **hypervascular** (remember: the tumour is pumping out VEGF). This means that biopsy of a suspected RCC bone metastasis can cause **life-threatening haemorrhage**. If a patient with a known renal mass has a lytic bone lesion, do NOT blindly biopsy it without considering pre-operative embolisation or at least being prepared for significant bleeding. Orthopaedic surgeons should be warned.
</Callout>

#### 1.4 Paraneoplastic Complications

These affect 6–10% of RCC patients and can cause significant morbidity even without metastatic disease [4]:

| ***Paraneoplastic Syndrome*** | Mechanism | Complication if Untreated |
|------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| ***Hypercalcaemia*** [1][11] | ***Most common paraneoplastic syndrome in RCC; caused by tumour secretion of PTHrP*** [1]; also possible via 1α-hydroxylation of vitamin D by tumour cells, or lytic bone metastases [11] | Confusion, polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, constipation, cardiac arrhythmias (shortened QT), renal stones, and in severe cases coma and death. Management: ***IV NS (rehydration) → bisphosphonate (pamidronate/zoledronic acid) ± calcitonin*** [11] |
| ***Polycythaemia*** [1] | ***Ectopic production of erythropoietin*** [1] (HIF-α drives EPO transcription in VHL-deficient tumour cells) | Hyperviscosity syndrome → thrombosis (DVT, PE, stroke), headache, plethora, visual disturbance. Management: phlebotomy; definitive = treat the tumour |
| ***Hypertension*** [1] | ***Ectopic renin secretion*** [1] → RAAS activation → Na/water retention + vasoconstriction | Accelerated/malignant hypertension → end-organ damage (LVH, renal impairment, retinopathy, stroke). Management: antihypertensives; definitive = tumour resection |
| ***Fever, weight loss, and cachexia*** [1] | ***Cytokine-mediated*** [1] (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1) → increased BMR, muscle catabolism, anorexia | Progressive debilitation; may mimic infection (FUO workup). RCC is a classic cause of PUO/FUO of neoplastic origin |
| ***Stauffer syndrome (nonmetastatic hepatic dysfunction)*** [1] | Unknown exact mechanism — likely IL-6-mediated hepatocyte dysfunction | Deranged LFTs (raised ALP, GGT, ± bilirubin), hepatosplenomegaly, fever — all without liver metastases. **Resolves after nephrectomy**. If LFTs don't normalise → suspect recurrence or true metastatic disease |
| **Anaemia of chronic disease** | Hepcidin upregulation (IL-6 → hepatic hepcidin production → blocks iron export from macrophages → functional iron deficiency) | Fatigue, dyspnoea, reduced exercise tolerance. Iron studies: low serum iron, low TIBC, high ferritin |
| **AA amyloidosis** | Chronic inflammation → sustained serum amyloid A (SAA) production → amyloid fibril deposition in kidneys, liver, spleen | Nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria), hepatosplenomegaly, GI dysfunction. Rare but important |
| **Thrombocytosis** | Reactive — IL-6-driven hepatic thrombopoietin production | May contribute to hypercoagulable state; associated with poorer prognosis |

### 2. Complications of Surgical Treatment

***The lecture slides specifically highlight complications of partial nephrectomy and radical nephrectomy*** [1].

#### 2.1 General Surgical Complications (Apply to Both PN and RN)

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| ***General anaesthetic risk*** [2] | Standard GA risks | Aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis, cardiovascular events |
| ***Bleeding*** [2] | RCC is highly vascular; renal hilum contains large-calibre vessels | Intraoperative haemorrhage; post-operative haematoma. Early ligation of renal artery mitigates this risk |
| ***Superficial or deep wound infections*** [2][3] | Standard surgical complication | More common in open approach; risk increased by obesity, DM, immunosuppression |
| ***Paralytic ileus*** [2] | Retroperitoneal dissection → irritation of sympathetic plexus → temporary bowel dysmotility; ***especially for the transperitoneal approach; ileus is not common when peritoneal cavity is not entered*** [2] | Abdominal distension, nausea, absent bowel sounds. Usually self-limiting |
| ***Pneumothorax*** [2][3] | ***Pleural injury*** — especially when operating on upper pole tumours via a flank approach, the pleura may be inadvertently entered | Post-op respiratory distress; diagnosed on CXR; managed with chest drain |
| ***Injury to adjacent organs*** [2][3][4] | Anatomical proximity during dissection | ***Left kidney: spleen, pancreas (tail). Right kidney: liver, gallbladder, duodenum (D2)*** [2][4] |
| ***Mortality*** | ***~2%*** [3] | Higher in T3–T4 disease with IVC involvement requiring complex reconstruction |

#### 2.2 Specific Complications of Partial Nephrectomy [4]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| ***Bleeding from the resection bed*** [4] | The cut surface of the remaining kidney is raw and vascular; warm ischaemia time during clamping must be < 30 minutes to avoid ischaemic damage, but this limits haemostasis time | May require re-exploration; use of haemostatic agents (Surgicel, TachoSil) |
| ***Urine leakage*** [4] | If the resection margin enters the collecting system and the defect is not adequately repaired | Urinoma formation; may require ureteric stenting or percutaneous drainage |
| ***Recurrence in the ipsilateral kidney*** [4] | Positive surgical margin; satellite tumour foci missed at initial surgery (7% synchronous tumours) [3] | Requires surveillance; may need completion nephrectomy |
| **Warm ischaemia injury** | Renal artery clamping during partial nephrectomy causes temporary ischaemia → if prolonged ( > 25–30 min), risk of irreversible tubular necrosis | Transient or permanent decline in ipsilateral kidney function; mitigated by selective arterial clamping, early unclamping, or cold ischaemia techniques (ice/cold fluid) [4] |

#### 2.3 Specific Complications of Radical Nephrectomy [2][3]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| ***Temporary or permanent renal failure*** [2][3] | Loss of entire kidney reduces total nephron mass by ~50%; if pre-existing CKD or solitary kidney → high risk of dialysis dependence | This is THE major long-term complication and the reason why partial nephrectomy is preferred for T1 tumours. Post-RN patients have increased long-term risk of CKD stage ≥ 3, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality |
| **Long-term metabolic/cardiovascular consequences** | Reduced renal function → hypertension, accelerated atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome | Lifelong monitoring of RFT; cardiovascular risk factor management |

<Callout title="Why Partial Nephrectomy Protects Against CKD">
The kidney has limited regenerative capacity. After radical nephrectomy, the contralateral kidney undergoes **compensatory hypertrophy** (individual nephrons enlarge and increase GFR), but this compensation is incomplete and plateaus. The remaining kidney handles 60–70% of the original total GFR. However, any future insult (diabetes, hypertension, contrast nephropathy, NSAID use) now acts on a single kidney with reduced reserve. This is why ***partial nephrectomy preserves kidney function better → limits development of long-term metabolic/CVS disorders*** [3].

### 3. Complications of Systemic Therapy

Modern metastatic RCC treatment involves **checkpoint inhibitors** and **TKIs**, both of which have significant toxicity profiles.

#### 3.1 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicity (Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, Pembrolizumab)

The key concept: checkpoint inhibitors work by **releasing the brakes on the immune system**. The downside is that the activated immune system can attack **normal tissues** → **immune-related adverse events (irAEs)**.

| Organ System | irAE | Mechanism | Management |
|-------------|------|-----------|------------|
| **Skin** | Rash, pruritus, vitiligo | T-cell-mediated attack on melanocytes and keratinocytes | Topical steroids; systemic steroids if severe |
| **GI** | Colitis, diarrhoea (especially with anti-CTLA-4 agents like ipilimumab) | Immune-mediated inflammation of colonic mucosa | Hold drug; IV steroids; infliximab if refractory |
| **Liver** | Hepatitis (raised transaminases) | Immune-mediated hepatocyte destruction | Hold drug; steroids; mycophenolate if refractory |
| **Endocrine** | Thyroiditis (hypo > hyperthyroid), hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 DM | Immune destruction of endocrine glands | Hormone replacement (often permanent); steroids for hypophysitis |
| **Lung** | Pneumonitis | Immune-mediated alveolar inflammation | Hold drug; high-dose steroids; may be fatal if not recognised early |
| **Renal** | Interstitial nephritis | Immune-mediated tubulointerstitial inflammation | Hold drug; steroids |
| **Neurological** | Neuropathy, myasthenia-like syndrome, encephalitis | Autoimmune attack on peripheral/central nervous system | Hold drug; steroids; IVIG/plasmapheresis |

<Callout title="irAEs — The Rule of Thumb" type="idea">
Anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) → more **colitis** and **hypophysitis**.
Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab/pembrolizumab) → more **thyroiditis** and **pneumonitis**.
Combination therapy → **higher rate AND severity** of irAEs (up to 60% grade 3–4 toxicity with ipilimumab + nivolumab).
The key is **early recognition**: any new symptom in a patient on checkpoint inhibitors should prompt you to think "could this be an irAE?" rather than attributing it to infection or disease progression.
</Callout>

#### 3.2 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Toxicity (Sunitinib, Pazopanib, Cabozantinib, Axitinib)

TKIs block VEGF receptors (and other kinases), so their toxicity profile reflects the physiological roles of these receptors:

| Side Effect | Mechanism | Details |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| **Hypertension** | VEGF normally promotes nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells → vasodilation. Blocking VEGF → reduced NO → vasoconstriction | Very common (up to 40%); dose-limiting; managed with antihypertensives (ACEi/ARB preferred) |
| **Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia)** | Direct toxicity to eccrine glands and capillaries in palms/soles | Painful, erythematous, desquamating skin changes; dose reduction if severe |
| **Diarrhoea** | Disruption of intestinal mucosal renewal (VEGF/PDGF involved in GI mucosal homeostasis) | Common; managed with loperamide |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Thyroid capillary regression (VEGF required for thyroid vasculature maintenance) → thyroid ischaemia → destructive thyroiditis → eventual hypothyroidism | Monitor TFTs regularly; treat with levothyroxine |
| **Fatigue** | Multifactorial (hypothyroidism, anaemia, direct CNS effects) | Very common; most common reason for dose reduction |
| **Mucositis/stomatitis** | Direct mucosal toxicity | Oral ulcers; managed with mouthwashes, dose reduction |
| **Cardiac toxicity** | LV dysfunction, QT prolongation; VEGF involved in cardiomyocyte survival | Baseline and interval echocardiography; ECG monitoring |
| **Proteinuria/renal toxicity** | VEGF is essential for glomerular endothelial health; blocking it → thrombotic microangiopathy in glomeruli | Monitor urinalysis; dose reduce or stop if nephrotic-range proteinuria |
| **Hepatotoxicity** | Off-target kinase inhibition in hepatocytes | More common with pazopanib; monitor LFTs regularly |
| **Bleeding/wound healing impairment** | VEGF is essential for angiogenesis in wound healing; blocking it impairs vascular repair | Stop TKI before and after surgery (usually 2–4 weeks); risk of bleeding |

#### 3.3 mTOR Inhibitor Toxicity (Everolimus, Temsirolimus)

| Side Effect | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Pneumonitis (non-infectious)** | mTOR inhibition → altered immune regulation → hypersensitivity pneumonitis |
| **Hyperglycaemia** | mTOR is downstream of insulin signalling → inhibition disrupts glucose homeostasis |
| **Hyperlipidaemia** | mTOR involved in lipid metabolism |
| **Mucositis** | Direct mucosal toxicity |
| **Immunosuppression** | mTOR is central to T-cell proliferation → increased infection risk |

---

### 4. Prognosis

Prognosis is estimated using risk stratification models:

| Stage | 5-Year Survival (approximate) |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| Stage I (T1N0M0) | ~90–95% |
| Stage II (T2N0M0) | ~75–85% |
| Stage III (T3/N1) | ~50–65% |
| Stage IV (T4/M1) | ~10–20% (improving with immunotherapy) |

**Favourable prognostic factors**: early stage, low nuclear grade, clear cell histology (responds to targeted/IO therapy), complete surgical resection, favourable IMDC risk score.

**Unfavourable prognostic factors**: sarcomatoid differentiation, collecting duct/medullary histology, high nuclear grade, venous invasion, lymph node involvement, metastatic disease at presentation, poor IMDC risk score.

      markscheme: "Most likely mechanism: paraneoplastic PTHrP secretion by the tumour (most common paraneoplastic syndrome in RCC). PTH would be appropriately suppressed (low or undetectable), as PTHrP suppresses endogenous PTH via feedback on the parathyroid glands but is not detected by standard PTH assays. Acute management: IV normal saline rehydration (dilute Ca and restore GFR), IV bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid 4mg over 15 min, or pamidronate), calcitonin for rapid short-term effect, and treat the underlying RCC (definitive)."

Biopsy of a suspected RCC bone metastasis can cause life-threatening haemorrhage because the lesion has abundant fragile neovasculature. Precaution: consider pre-operative angiographic embolisation of the lesion before biopsy or surgical intervention, and be prepared for significant intraoperative bleeding."

      question: "Why does sunitinib (a VEGF receptor TKI) cause hypertension, and how is this managed?",
      markscheme: "Mechanism: VEGF normally promotes nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells, causing vasodilation. Blocking VEGF receptor signalling reduces NO synthesis, leading to vasoconstriction and increased peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in hypertension. Occurs in up to 40% of patients. Management: antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred as first-line), regular blood pressure monitoring, dose reduction of TKI if severe or refractory."
