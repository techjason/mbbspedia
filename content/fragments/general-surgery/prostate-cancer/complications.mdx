## Complications of Prostate Cancer

Complications of prostate cancer can be organised into three broad categories that are conceptually distinct and must be understood separately:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (local progression and metastatic disease)
2. **Complications of treatment** (surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy)
3. **Complications of diagnostic procedures** (biopsy) and **screening** (overdiagnosis)

Understanding why each complication occurs — from first principles — is far more useful than memorising a list. Each complication has a clear pathophysiological basis rooted in anatomy, tumour biology, or the mechanism of the treatment that caused it.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Itself

These complications arise because the cancer either grows locally (compressing or invading adjacent structures) or metastasises distantly.

#### A1. Local Complications

##### Bladder Outlet Obstruction and Urinary Retention

- **Mechanism**: Although prostate cancer arises in the peripheral zone (and therefore causes LUTS late), large tumours or those with central/transitional zone extension eventually compress or invade the prostatic urethra and bladder neck → increased urethral resistance → voiding difficulty → ultimately acute urinary retention (AROU).
- **Clinical presentation**: Progressive voiding LUTS (hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete emptying) → AROU (inability to void, suprapubic pain, palpable distended bladder)
- **Management**: Urethral catheterisation; if failed, suprapubic catheter; ***may consider TURP to relieve obstruction*** [4] (palliative TURP — note that this does NOT cure the cancer, it simply debulks the intraprostatic component to relieve the obstruction)

##### Obstructive Uropathy and Renal Failure

- **Mechanism**: Cancer invading the bladder trigone or ureteric orifices → unilateral or bilateral ureteric obstruction → hydronephrosis → obstructive nephropathy → ***post-renal AKI*** [11]. Alternatively, bulky pelvic lymphadenopathy can extrinsically compress the ureters.
- **Clinical presentation**: May be silent (bilateral chronic partial obstruction → gradual renal impairment detected on bloods); or acute with flank pain if sudden complete obstruction
- **Key point**: ***Post-renal disease is rapidly reversible if recognised early, but prolonged obstruction progresses to tubulointerstitial fibrosis (i.e., irreversible intrinsic renal disease)*** [11]
- **Management**: Ureteric stenting (retrograde via cystoscopy, or antegrade via percutaneous nephrostomy) to relieve obstruction; treat underlying cancer

##### Haematuria and Haemospermia

- **Mechanism**: Tumour eroding into the prostatic urethra or ejaculatory ducts disrupts vascular integrity → blood in the urine or semen
- ***Haematuria or haemospermia ( < 1%): uncommon, can also be due to BPH*** [4]
- **Management**: Usually conservative (tumour-directed treatment will reduce bleeding); severe haematuria may require bladder irrigation, cystoscopy with fulguration, or palliative RT

##### Local Invasion

- ***Direct extension: stromal invasion through prostatic capsule → urethra, bladder base, seminal vesicles*** [4]
- **Rectal invasion** is rare because Denonvilliers' fascia acts as a natural barrier between the prostate and rectum, but can occur in T4 disease → tenesmus, rectal bleeding, fistula formation
- **Neurovascular bundle invasion** → new-onset erectile dysfunction (cavernous nerves immediately posterolateral to prostate capsule)
- **Lower limb lymphoedema** → ***lymphoedema due to pelvic lymphadenopathy or lymph node metastases*** [4]; bulky inguinal/pelvic nodes obstruct lymphatic drainage

#### A2. Metastatic Complications

##### Bone Metastases — The Dominant Source of Morbidity

***Vertebral metastasis is the commonest metastatic site*** [4]. ***Reason: Batson's plexus connects prostatic venous plexus to internal vertebral plexus*** [4].

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Bone pain** | Osteoblastic metastases cause periosteal stretching, microfractures, and local inflammatory mediator release; typically dull, deep, progressive, worse at night | ***Analgesics (WHO ladder), palliative RT (excellent for focal pain), osteoclast inhibition (bisphosphonate, denosumab)*** [4] |
| **Pathological fractures** | Despite being osteoblastic, new bone is structurally disorganised and weak → fractures through vertebral bodies, pelvis, proximal femur | Orthopaedic fixation if long bone; vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty if vertebral; treat underlying disease |
| ***Spinal cord compression (SCC)*** | Vertebral body collapse or epidural tumour extension compresses the spinal cord → ***oncological emergency*** | ***High-dose steroids (dexamethasone), decompressive surgery, palliative RT*** [4] |
| ***Hypercalcaemia*** | Less common in prostate cancer than other bone-metastasising cancers (osteoblastic lesions sequester calcium); when present, usually due to ***PTHrP secretion or massive disease burden*** [10][14] | IV normal saline rehydration, bisphosphonate (zoledronic acid), calcitonin, treat underlying disease [14] |
| **Bone marrow failure** | Extensive marrow infiltration by metastatic deposits → crowding out of normal haematopoietic cells → pancytopenia (anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia) | Transfusion support; treat underlying cancer; leukoerythroblastic blood film on peripheral smear |

##### Spinal Cord Compression — In Detail

This is an **oncological emergency** that demands immediate recognition and treatment. Delay of even hours can result in irreversible paraplegia.

- ***Epidemiology: prostate cancer accounts for ~20% of all malignant cord compression*** [15]; ***> 90% vertebral, especially thoracic*** [15]
- ***Routes of spread: haematogenous (most common), direct invasion, lymphatics*** [15]
- ***Presentation: bone pain and tenderness → motor/sensory symptoms → sphincter disturbance (late)*** [15]
  - The classic sequence is: **back pain** (often the first symptom, present for weeks before neurological signs) → **radiculopathy** (band-like pain in a dermatomal distribution) → **motor weakness** (upper motor neuron pattern below the level: spasticity, hyperreflexia, upgoing plantars) → **sensory level** (loss of sensation below the compression) → **sphincter dysfunction** (urinary retention, faecal incontinence — this is a LATE sign and indicates severe cord damage)
- ***Investigations*** [15]:
  - ***MRI of the entire spine: confirm extradural compressive lesion***
  - ***Important to image the entire spine because 33% have multilevel involvement*** [15]
  - Plain X-ray: may show osteolytic/osteoblastic lesions, vertebral collapse, pedicle erosion (the "winking owl" sign — loss of one pedicle on AP view)
- ***Management*** [15]:
  - ***Dexamethasone 4 mg IV Q6H if neurological symptoms present*** — reduces peritumoral oedema and buys time
  - ***Surgical decompression + stabilisation followed by RT if unstable spine***
  - ***RT alone if stable spine OR unfavourable prognosis***

<Callout title="Spinal Cord Compression — The Golden Rule" type="error">
If a patient with known prostate cancer develops **new back pain** — especially if it is progressive, worse at night, and associated with ANY neurological symptom (even subtle leg weakness or altered sensation) — treat it as cord compression until proven otherwise. Get an **urgent MRI of the entire spine** and start **dexamethasone** immediately. Once the patient becomes paraplegic, recovery is unlikely even with treatment.
</Callout>

##### Other Metastatic Complications

- ***Liver metastases***: hepatomegaly, deranged LFTs, RUQ pain, jaundice (late) [4]
- ***Lung metastases***: usually asymptomatic (incidental CXR/CT finding); late: cough, haemoptysis, breathlessness [16]
- ***Adrenal metastases***: usually asymptomatic; rarely symptomatic adrenal insufficiency [16]
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: uncommon but reported in advanced prostate cancer; the mechanism involves release of tissue factor and procoagulant substances from tumour cells

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### B1. Complications of Radical Prostatectomy (RP)

***Complications of radical prostatectomy*** [1][3][4]:

| Complication | Frequency | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Erectile dysfunction*** | ***30% even with good nerve sparing*** [4]; ***50% overall*** [2] | ***Damage to cavernous nerves*** lying immediately posterolateral to the prostatic capsule [1]; even nerve-sparing causes neuropraxia (stretch injury) with potential recovery over 6–24 months | ***PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) or penile prosthesis*** [1]; vacuum erection device; intracavernosal injections (alprostadil) |
| ***Stress urinary incontinence*** | ***50% early (immediate post-op), 5–10% long-term*** [4]; ***10%*** [2] | Damage to the external urethral sphincter during apical dissection; the patient loses the internal sphincter (bladder neck is removed with prostate) and relies entirely on the external sphincter | ***Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegels) first-line; artificial urinary sphincter (AMS 800) for refractory cases*** [1] |
| ***Anastomotic (bladder neck) stricture*** | ***5–10%*** [4] | Scarring at the vesicourethral anastomosis (where the bladder neck is re-joined to the urethral stump) → fibrotic narrowing | Endoscopic incision/dilation; rarely requires repeat surgery |
| ***Bleeding*** | ***5–10%*** [4] | Division of the dorsal venous complex (Santorini's plexus) overlying the prostatic apex; prostatic arterial branches | Intra-operative haemostasis; transfusion if significant |
| ***Rectal injury*** | ***< 5%*** [4] | Prostate sits immediately anterior to the rectum; the posterior dissection plane (Denonvilliers' fascia) is thin → inadvertent perforation | Intra-operative primary repair; temporary diverting colostomy if large injury |
| ***General perioperative*** | Mortality < 0.3% | ***MI, DVT*** [1], pulmonary embolism, wound infection, anaesthetic complications | Standard VTE prophylaxis, cardiac risk assessment |
| ***Urine leaks*** | Uncommon | Anastomotic leak early post-op; usually resolves with prolonged catheter drainage | Keep Foley for ≥ 7 days [4]; re-catheterise if detected late |
| ***Ureteral injury*** | Rare | During dissection of the bladder base, the ureteric orifices may be inadvertently injured | Intra-operative recognition and reimplantation |

***Anejaculation*** is universal after RP because the seminal vesicles, vas deferens ampullae, and prostatic urethra are all removed — there is no ejaculatory apparatus remaining. ***Orgasm is typically NOT affected*** [17], as orgasmic sensation is mediated by somatic sensory nerves (pudendal nerve) that are usually preserved.

<Callout title="Retrograde Ejaculation vs Anejaculation — Know the Difference" type="error">
- After **TURP** (for BPH): ***retrograde ejaculation (40–60%)*** — the bladder neck is resected, so semen flows backwards into the bladder instead of out through the urethra. The patient still produces semen but it goes the "wrong way."
- After **radical prostatectomy**: **anejaculation** (100%) — the entire prostate, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory ducts are removed. There is NO semen produced at all. The patient is infertile. This is fundamentally different from retrograde ejaculation.
</Callout>

#### B2. Complications of Radiotherapy (RT)

***Complications of radiotherapy*** [1][4]:

| Complication | Frequency | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Erectile dysfunction*** | ***Up to 30%*** [4] | Radiation damage to the neurovascular bundles and penile vasculature; onset is **gradual** (6–36 months), unlike RP where ED is immediate |
| ***Radiation cystitis*** | ***Up to 10%*** [4] | Radiation injury to the bladder urothelium → mucosal oedema, telangiectasia, ulceration → ***frequency, urgency, dysuria, haematuria*** [1] |
| ***Radiation proctitis*** | ***Up to 10%*** [4] | Radiation injury to the anterior rectal wall (rectum is immediately posterior to the prostate) → ***diarrhoea, tenesmus, PR bleeding*** [1] |
| ***Irritative LUTS*** | Common | Radiation-induced inflammation of the prostatic urethra and bladder → detrusor overactivity and mucosal irritation; ***GI: proctitis, enteritis, diarrhoea, frequency, urgency, tenesmus; UG: cystitis, urethritis, frequency, urgency, dysuria*** [1] |
| **Urethral stricture** | Late | Radiation-induced fibrosis of the urethra |
| **Secondary malignancy** | Very rare, late | Radiation-induced carcinogenesis (bladder cancer, rectal cancer) — typically > 10 years after treatment |
| ***Lower stress incontinence rate compared to RP*** [2] | — | RT preserves the external sphincter (no surgical dissection near the sphincter); however, ***increased irritative symptoms (FUN: frequency, urgency, nocturia)*** [2] |

#### B3. Complications of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT)

ADT removes the androgen signal that is essential for multiple physiological functions beyond the prostate. This creates a constellation of side effects that is essentially a **male hypogonadal syndrome**:

| Side Effect | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hot flushes*** [1] | Loss of testosterone disrupts hypothalamic thermoregulatory set-point (analogous to menopausal hot flashes from oestrogen withdrawal) | Medroxyprogesterone acetate, venlafaxine, gabapentin |
| ***Erectile dysfunction / loss of libido*** [1] | Testosterone is the primary driver of male sexual desire and contributes to erectile function; its removal → loss of sexual interest and ability | PDE5 inhibitors (limited effect without libido); psychosexual counselling |
| ***Gynecomastia*** [1] | Androgen deprivation shifts the androgen/oestrogen ratio in favour of oestrogen (aromatisation of residual adrenal androgens) → oestrogen-stimulated breast tissue proliferation | Prophylactic breast irradiation, tamoxifen |
| ***Osteoporosis → pathological fractures*** | Androgens maintain bone density; their removal → accelerated osteoclastic resorption → bone mineral density loss (~4% per year on ADT) | ***Bisphosphonates (alendronate, zoledronic acid) or RANK-ligand inhibitor (denosumab)*** for prevention of bone loss [1]; calcium and vitamin D supplementation; weight-bearing exercise; baseline and serial DEXA scans |
| ***↓ Lean body mass, ↑ body fat, ↓ muscle strength*** [4] | Androgens are anabolic hormones that maintain muscle mass; their loss → sarcopenia and central adiposity | Resistance exercise; dietary counselling |
| ***↑ Risk of cardiovascular disease and ↑ insulin resistance*** [4] | ADT causes a metabolic syndrome-like picture: dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, central obesity, increased inflammatory markers | Monitor metabolic parameters (glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile); cardiovascular risk factor management; exercise; GnRH antagonists (relugolix) may have lower cardiovascular risk than GnRH agonists |
| ***Anaemia*** [1] | Androgens stimulate erythropoiesis (both directly on marrow and via EPO production); their removal → decreased RBC production | Monitor Hb; transfusion if symptomatic; ESAs rarely used |
| ***Fatigue*** [1] | Multifactorial: anaemia, loss of muscle mass, metabolic changes, psychological impact | Exercise (strongest evidence); address other contributing factors |
| **Cognitive impairment / depression** | Androgens have neuroprotective and mood-regulatory roles; their removal → mood disturbance, impaired concentration, depression | Screening and psychological support; consider intermittent ADT in appropriate patients |

<Callout title="Bone Health in ADT — Don't Forget!">
Men on long-term ADT lose bone at a rate comparable to postmenopausal women. Without intervention, up to **20% will sustain an osteoporotic fracture within 5 years**. Current guidelines recommend: baseline DEXA scan at initiation of ADT, calcium (1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (800–1000 IU/day) supplementation, weight-bearing exercise, and consideration of bisphosphonate or denosumab if the patient is at high fracture risk (T-score ≤ -2.5 or other risk factors).
</Callout>

#### B4. Specific Complications of GnRH Agonists: The "Flare" Phenomenon

- ***GnRH agonists cause an initial testosterone surge ("flare")*** for 1–2 weeks before receptor downregulation achieves castrate levels [1]
- In patients with extensive bone metastases or impending cord compression, this flare can cause **catastrophic worsening**: increased bone pain, cord compression, ureteric obstruction, DIC
- **Prevention**: Anti-androgen cover (e.g., bicalutamide) for the first 2–4 weeks; or use a GnRH antagonist (no flare)

#### B5. Complications of Chemotherapy (Docetaxel, Cabazitaxel)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Myelosuppression*** (neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia) [1] | Taxanes disrupt microtubule dynamics in rapidly dividing cells → bone marrow suppression → infection risk (febrile neutropenia), bleeding, fatigue |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Microtubule stabilisation in sensory neurons → axonal transport disruption → painful paraesthesiae (dose-limiting) |
| **Fatigue** | Multifactorial: anaemia, cytokine release, metabolic effects |
| **GI toxicity** | Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, mucositis — rapidly dividing GI epithelial cells are affected |
| **Fluid retention / oedema** | Docetaxel-specific; mechanism not fully understood; premedication with dexamethasone reduces incidence |
| **Allergic/hypersensitivity reactions** | Polysorbate 80 (vehicle for docetaxel) can trigger reactions; premedication required |

#### B6. Complications of Bone-Directed Therapy (Bisphosphonates / Denosumab)

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| **Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)** | Inhibition of osteoclasts impairs normal bone remodelling in the jaw (which has high turnover due to mastication and dental procedures) → exposed necrotic bone | Dental review and dental work BEFORE starting therapy; avoid invasive dental procedures while on treatment; good oral hygiene |
| **Hypocalcaemia** | Potent osteoclast inhibition → reduced calcium release from bone → serum calcium drops | Supplement calcium and vitamin D; monitor serum calcium |
| **Atypical femoral fractures** | Prolonged suppression of bone remodelling → accumulation of microdamage in cortical bone → stress fractures in the subtrochanteric region | Rare with short-term use; consider drug holiday after 3–5 years in osteoporosis (less relevant in cancer setting) |
| **Renal toxicity (bisphosphonates)** | IV bisphosphonates (especially zoledronic acid) are nephrotoxic; require adequate hydration and dose adjustment for renal impairment | Check creatinine before each dose; avoid if CrCl < 30 (zoledronic acid) |

---

### C. Complications of Diagnostic Procedures

#### C1. Prostate Biopsy Complications

***Complications of prostate biopsy (~3% overall)*** [4]:

| Complication | Frequency | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Fever*** | ***1 in 4 (common despite prophylactic antibiotics)*** [4] | Transient bacteraemia from rectal flora (especially transrectal approach) |
| ***Bleeding: PR bleed, haematochezia, haemospermia, haematuria*** | ***~1%*** [4] | Needle traverses vascular prostatic tissue |
| ***Urosepsis*** | ***~1% (uncommon but can be severe)*** [4] | Rectal bacteria seeded into prostate and bloodstream; ***give prophylactic gentamicin beforehand*** [4]; ***infection < 0.5% for transperineal, ~5% for transrectal (antibiotic prophylaxis with fluoroquinolone required)*** [2] |
| ***AROU*** | ***1–2%*** [2] | ***Pain and swelling of the prostate*** from procedure-related inflammation → obstruction of prostatic urethra |
| ***Prostatitis and prostatic abscess*** [1] | Rare | Bacterial seeding during transrectal biopsy |

#### C2. Harms of Screening and Overdiagnosis

***Harms of PSA screening*** [3][1]:

| Harm | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***Overdiagnosis*** | ***Detection by screening of conditions that would not have become clinically significant*** [1] — many low-grade cancers detected by screening would never cause symptoms or death in the patient's lifetime |
| ***Overtreatment*** | ***Aggressive therapy including radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy are provided even with early-staged disease*** [1] → ***complications include urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction and sexual dysfunction*** [1][3] |
| ***False positives leading to anxiety and unnecessary biopsies*** [3] | Elevated PSA from benign causes → patient undergoes biopsy (with its own risks) → no cancer found → but significant psychological distress throughout |
| **Psychological harm** | ***Being diagnosed with prostate cancer is psychologically distressing; negative biopsy result is also distressing since it cannot completely rule out cancer given the high false-negative biopsy rate*** [1] |

### D. Complications of Castration-Resistant Disease (CRPC)

CRPC represents the final common pathway of prostate cancer and is the lethal phase of the disease. Complications at this stage are the culmination of treatment resistance and widespread disease:

- **Progressive bone disease**: increasing pain, pathological fractures, cord compression, hypercalcaemia
- **Visceral metastases**: liver failure (hepatic mets), respiratory failure (pulmonary mets)
- **Bone marrow failure**: pancytopenia from extensive marrow infiltration → infections, bleeding, transfusion dependence
- **Cancer cachexia**: progressive weight loss, sarcopenia, anorexia — mediated by tumour-derived cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) disrupting metabolic homeostasis
- **Thromboembolic disease**: prostate cancer is a prothrombotic state → DVT, PE
- **Treatment toxicity**: cumulative side effects of multiple lines of systemic therapy (chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, myelosuppression, cardiotoxicity from ADT)

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Prostate Cancer">

**Disease complications:**
- **Local**: BOO/AROU (late, peripheral zone), obstructive uropathy/renal failure (trigone/ureteric invasion), haematuria, local invasion (bladder, seminal vesicles, neurovascular bundles)
- **Metastatic**: Bone pain, pathological fractures, **spinal cord compression (emergency: dexamethasone + MRI whole spine + decompression/RT)**, bone marrow failure, hypercalcaemia (less common in prostate cancer), liver/lung/adrenal mets

**Treatment complications:**
- **RP**: ED (30–50%), stress incontinence (5–10% long-term), anastomotic stricture (5–10%), bleeding (5–10%), rectal injury ( < 5%), anejaculation (100%)
- **RT**: ED (30%, gradual onset), radiation cystitis/proctitis (up to 10%), lower incontinence than RP, secondary malignancy (rare, late)
- **ADT**: Hot flushes, ED, loss of libido, gynecomastia, osteoporosis, metabolic syndrome (obesity, CVD risk, insulin resistance), anaemia, fatigue, cognitive changes
- **GnRH agonist flare**: Testosterone surge → bone pain crisis, cord compression, ureteric obstruction. Prevent with anti-androgen cover or use GnRH antagonist.
- **Chemotherapy**: Myelosuppression, neuropathy, GI toxicity, fatigue
- **Bone-directed therapy**: ONJ, hypocalcaemia, atypical fractures, renal toxicity

**Diagnostic complications:**
- **Biopsy**: Fever (25%), bleeding (1%), urosepsis (1%), AROU (1–2%)
- **Screening harms**: Overdiagnosis, overtreatment (incontinence, ED, bowel dysfunction), false positives, anxiety
