## Complications of Laryngeal Carcinoma

Complications of laryngeal carcinoma arise from three main sources: **the disease itself** (tumour-related), **the treatment** (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), and **long-term sequelae** affecting function and quality of life. Let me walk through each systematically, explaining the pathophysiological basis of every complication from first principles.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself (Tumour-Related)

These are complications that arise from the natural progression of untreated or advancing laryngeal carcinoma.

#### 1.1 Airway Obstruction

- **Pathophysiology**: Tumour bulk progressively narrows the laryngeal lumen. The subglottis is the narrowest portion of the adult laryngeal airway (~6 mm radius), so even moderate tumour growth here causes critical stenosis. Additionally, **bilateral vocal fold fixation** (from tumour invasion of both cricoarytenoid joints or bilateral paraglottic space involvement) prevents abduction during inspiration → fixed adducted cords → near-complete obstruction
- **Clinical presentation**: Progressive dyspnoea on exertion → dyspnoea at rest → stridor (inspiratory if supraglottic; biphasic if glottic/subglottic) → respiratory failure
- **Management**: ***ALWAYS protect the airway*** [2] — emergency tracheostomy or awake fibreoptic intubation. This must be addressed BEFORE any oncological workup in a patient presenting with stridor

#### 1.2 Aspiration Pneumonia

- **Pathophysiology**: The larynx is the primary sphincter protecting the airway during swallowing. Tumour disrupts this mechanism in two ways:
  1. **Mechanical**: Tumour bulk prevents complete glottic closure → food/saliva enters the trachea
  2. **Neurological**: Invasion of the superior laryngeal nerve (internal branch) abolishes the supraglottic sensory reflex → the patient does not sense aspirated material and does not trigger a protective cough
  3. **Motor**: Vocal fold fixation prevents adduction → absent protective cough reflex (cannot generate intrathoracic pressure against a closed glottis)
- Recurrent aspiration → chemical pneumonitis → bacterial superinfection → aspiration pneumonia
- This is a major source of morbidity and mortality in advanced disease

#### 1.3 Dysphagia and Malnutrition

- **Pathophysiology**: Supraglottic and transglottic tumours obstruct the pharyngeal inlet or fix the laryngeal framework, preventing normal laryngeal elevation during swallowing. Pain (odynophagia) further reduces oral intake. Cancer cachexia (TNF-α, IL-6 driven hypermetabolism) compounds the problem
- Many patients are already **malnourished** at presentation due to combined dysphagia, alcohol-related malnutrition, and cancer cachexia

#### 1.4 Haemorrhage

- **Pathophysiology**: Tumour neovascularisation produces fragile, disorganised blood vessels (driven by VEGF). Ulceration of the tumour surface exposes these vessels → haemoptysis. In very advanced disease (T4a/T4b), tumour can erode into the **carotid artery** → catastrophic "carotid blow-out" (see below)

#### 1.5 Lymph Node and Distant Metastasis

- **Pathophysiology**: Tumour cells access lymphatic channels → regional nodal disease. Haematogenous spread (via pulmonary capillary bed) → distant metastasis to **lung** (most common), bone, liver
- ***Supraglottic tumours have 30–50% nodal metastasis; subglottic ~40%; early glottic < 5%*** [2]
- Distant metastasis is uncommon at presentation (~5–10%) but increases with advancing stage

#### 1.6 Second Primary Tumour (Field Cancerisation)

- **Pathophysiology**: Chronic carcinogen exposure (smoking + alcohol) causes widespread mucosal dysplasia across the entire upper aerodigestive tract → ***patients with laryngeal cancer are more likely to develop a second primary tumour in the lung*** [2]
- This is a **lifelong risk** that persists even after cure of the index tumour — mandates surveillance

### 2. Complications of Treatment

#### 2.1 Complications of Radiotherapy

Radiation works by causing **double-strand DNA breaks** in rapidly dividing cells. Unfortunately, normal rapidly dividing tissues (mucosa, skin, bone marrow) are also affected — this is the basis of all RT side effects.

| Complication | Timing | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| ***Radiation dermatitis*** [2] | Acute (weeks 2–4) | Direct radiation damage to basal keratinocytes → erythema → dry desquamation → moist desquamation. Skin in the radiation field becomes erythematous, then peels |
| **Radiation mucositis** | Acute (weeks 2–5) | Mucosal epithelium turns over every 5–7 days; radiation kills proliferating basal cells → ulceration, pain, pseudomembrane formation → ***odynophagia and dysphagia*** [2] |
| ***Hoarseness*** [2] | Acute/subacute | Radiation-induced oedema of the vocal folds → stiffened mucosal wave → voice change. Usually temporary but may persist |
| ***Laryngeal oedema*** [2] | Subacute (weeks to months) | Radiation damages lymphatic endothelium → impaired lymphatic drainage → fluid accumulation in the supraglottic tissues. Can cause airway compromise if severe; may require short-course steroids or rarely tracheostomy |
| **Xerostomia** | Acute → chronic | Radiation damages salivary acinar cells (particularly serous acini of the parotid). Modern IMRT spares the contralateral parotid to reduce this. Dry mouth → difficulty swallowing, increased dental caries, oral candidiasis |
| ***Laryngeal or pharyngeal stenosis*** [2] | Late (months to years) | Radiation-induced fibrosis of the submucosal tissue → progressive narrowing of the laryngeal or pharyngeal lumen. Presents with progressive dysphagia or stridor long after treatment completion |
| **Osteoradionecrosis** | Late (months to years) | Radiation causes endarteritis obliterans (intimal fibrosis of small blood vessels) → hypoxic, hypovascular, hypocellular bone → susceptible to necrosis, especially after trauma (e.g., dental extraction). Primarily affects the mandible if in the RT field |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Late (months to years) | The thyroid gland is often within the radiation field for laryngeal cancer. Radiation damages thyroid follicular cells → progressive gland failure → ↓ T4 → ↑ TSH. Occurs in 20–50% of patients receiving neck RT. Requires lifelong TSH monitoring |
| **Carotid artery stenosis** | Very late ( > 5 years) | Radiation-induced accelerated atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries → increased risk of stroke. Radiation damages the vascular endothelium → inflammatory cascade → intimal thickening → stenosis |
| **Radiation-induced second malignancy** | Very late ( > 10 years) | Radiation itself is mutagenic → can induce new cancers (typically sarcomas) in the radiation field. Risk is low but real |
| **Dental caries** | Late | Secondary to xerostomia — saliva normally buffers oral pH and contains antimicrobial enzymes; without it, dental decay accelerates. Patients need lifelong fluoride application and dental follow-up |

<Callout title="Chondroradionecrosis of the Larynx">
A dreaded late complication of laryngeal RT. Radiation damages the perichondrial blood supply to the laryngeal cartilages (especially the arytenoids and cricoid) → avascular necrosis → cartilage exposure → secondary infection → abscess → potential airway compromise. Clinically presents with persistent pain, dysphagia, and progressive hoarseness months to years after RT. May require surgical debridement or even salvage laryngectomy.

#### 2.2 Complications of Chemotherapy (Cisplatin-Based CRT)

Cisplatin is the backbone of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Its toxicity profile reflects its mechanism — it forms DNA crosslinks in ALL rapidly dividing cells, not just tumour cells.

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Nephrotoxicity** | Cisplatin is concentrated in the renal tubular epithelium → direct tubular cell death and oxidative stress → acute tubular necrosis. Dose-limiting toxicity. Requires aggressive IV hydration (pre- and post-infusion) and monitoring of creatinine/GFR |
| **Ototoxicity** | Cisplatin damages outer hair cells of the cochlea (particularly the basal turn, which encodes high-frequency sound) → irreversible, bilateral, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Cumulative and dose-dependent |
| **Nausea/vomiting** | Highly emetogenic. Cisplatin triggers 5-HT3 receptors on vagal afferents in the GI tract and CTZ in the area postrema → requires triple antiemetic prophylaxis (5-HT3 antagonist + dexamethasone + NK1 antagonist) |
| **Myelosuppression** | Bone marrow suppression → neutropenia (nadir ~10–14 days), anaemia, thrombocytopenia → increased risk of infection and bleeding |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Cisplatin damages dorsal root ganglia → sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling in hands and feet); cumulative and potentially irreversible |
| **Enhanced mucositis** | When combined with RT, chemotherapy acts as a radiosensitiser — this amplifies the mucosal damage → more severe mucositis, odynophagia, and dysphagia than RT alone |

#### 2.3 Complications of Surgery

##### A. ***Partial Open Laryngectomy Complications*** [2]

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| ***Laryngocutaneous fistula*** [2] | Breakdown of the pharyngeal/laryngeal mucosal closure → abnormal communication between the neopharynx/larynx and the neck skin. Saliva and food leak through the wound. Risk factors: prior RT (impairs wound healing), poor nutrition, diabetes. Management: conservative (NPO, wound care, antibiotics) initially; may need surgical repair if persistent |
| ***Aspiration pneumonia*** [2] | Partial laryngectomy removes part of the laryngeal sphincteric mechanism → food and saliva are aspirated during swallowing. The most dangerous functional complication. Requires pre-operative swallowing counselling and post-operative speech-language pathology (SLP) rehabilitation |
| ***Swallowing difficulties*** [2] | Altered anatomy → impaired laryngeal elevation, reduced pharyngeal squeeze, and sensory deficits → dysphagia. Needs dietary modification and swallowing therapy |
| ***Bleeding and infection*** [2] | Standard surgical complications. Post-operative haematoma can compromise the airway — analogous to post-thyroidectomy haematoma. Infection can lead to wound breakdown and fistula |

##### B. ***Total Laryngectomy Complications*** [2]

These are the most significant complications in the entire topic because they fundamentally alter the patient's physiology and quality of life.

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Loss of ability to speak*** [2] | Removal of the vocal folds eliminates the sound source for speech. The upper airway is permanently disconnected from the lower airway, so air no longer passes through the vocal tract | ***Voice rehabilitation***: TEP with voice prosthesis (most common), oesophageal speech, electrolarynx [2] |
| ***Loss of coughing effort*** [2] | The Valsalva mechanism requires closing the glottis to build intrathoracic pressure. Without a glottis, the patient cannot generate an effective cough → difficulty clearing tracheal secretions | Humidification of inspired air (HME filter over stoma), regular suctioning, chest physiotherapy |
| ***Swallowing dysfunction*** [2] — ***Stricture of neopharynx or anastomosis / Regurgitation*** [2] | The hypopharynx is closed primarily to create a neopharynx. Scar tissue formation at the closure site → progressive narrowing (stricture) → dysphagia. Regurgitation occurs when the neopharyngeal reservoir is small or the swallowing mechanism is uncoordinated | Endoscopic dilation for stricture; dietary modification; may need PEG if severe |
| ***Endocrine dysfunction — Hypothyroidism / Hypoparathyroidism*** [2] | Part or all of the thyroid and parathyroid glands may be removed during laryngectomy (especially if thyroid is invaded by tumour or in subglottic cancers requiring thyroidectomy). Hypothyroidism: loss of T4 production → fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance. Hypoparathyroidism: loss of PTH → hypocalcaemia → perioral numbness, carpopedal spasm, Chvostek's/Trousseau's signs, potentially ***laryngospasm*** (though the patient no longer has a larynx, hypocalcaemic tetany can still cause respiratory muscle spasm) | Monitor TSH and calcium post-operatively. Thyroxine replacement for hypothyroidism. Calcium + calcitriol for hypoparathyroidism. ***Acute hypocalcaemia: IV 10–20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over 10 min*** [2] |
| **Pharyngocutaneous fistula** | Most common early post-operative complication (~15–25%). Breakdown of the neopharyngeal closure → saliva leaks into the neck → can track to skin. Risk factors: prior RT, poor nutrition, diabetes, positive margins, large pharyngeal defect | NPO, wound care, antibiotics, negative pressure wound therapy. Surgical repair if persistent ( > 4–6 weeks). If carotid artery is exposed → risk of carotid blow-out |
| ***Stigmatisation with permanent tracheostomy*** [2] | Psychosocial rather than physical — the patient has a permanent hole in the lower neck through which they breathe. This is visible, requires daily care (stoma cleaning, HME filter), and fundamentally changes social interaction | Psychosocial support, laryngectomy support groups, stoma covers/scarves, heat and moisture exchange (HME) devices |
| **Stomal recurrence** | Tumour recurrence at the tracheostomy stoma site. Risk factors: subglottic extension, paratracheal nodal disease, emergency pre-operative tracheostomy through tumour-involved tissue | Post-operative RT reduces risk; surveillance; may require revision surgery |
| **Carotid blow-out** | The most feared complication. Erosion of the carotid artery wall by a combination of: wound infection/fistula + radiation-induced vessel wall weakening + direct tumour recurrence. Presents as massive haemorrhage from the neck/stoma. Mortality ~40% | Emergency: direct pressure, call vascular surgery. Definitive: endovascular stenting or carotid ligation (risks stroke). Prevention: adequate soft tissue coverage of the carotid during surgery; prompt management of fistulae |

<Callout title="Carotid Blow-Out — The 'Warning Bleed'" type="error">
Carotid blow-out does not always present as a sudden torrential haemorrhage. There is often a **"sentinel" or "warning bleed"** — a small-volume arterial bleed from the neck wound or stoma that precedes the catastrophic rupture by hours to days. Any unexplained arterial bleeding from the neck of a post-laryngectomy (especially post-RT) patient must be treated as a potential carotid blow-out and investigated urgently with CT angiography [2].
</Callout>

##### C. Neck Dissection Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|
| **Spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) injury** | Damaged during modified radical or radical neck dissection → trapezius muscle weakness/paralysis → "shoulder syndrome" (shoulder drop, winged scapula, difficulty with arm abduction above 90°). More common in radical neck dissection where CN XI is deliberately sacrificed |
| **Internal jugular vein thrombosis** | Ligation or injury → ipsilateral facial/cerebral venous congestion. Usually well-tolerated if unilateral (contralateral IJV compensates). Bilateral IJV ligation → raised intracranial pressure, facial oedema (rare, only in bilateral radical neck dissection) |
| **Chyle leak** | Thoracic duct injury (left neck dissection, level IV) → chyle leaks into the surgical field → chylous fistula. Diagnosis: milky output from the drain, triglycerides > 110 mg/dL. Management: NPO + TPN + pressure dressing; octreotide; surgical exploration if > 1 L/day |
| **Marginal mandibular nerve injury** | Branch of CN VII; runs superficial to the submandibular gland. Damaged during level I dissection → ipsilateral lower lip weakness → asymmetric smile |
| **Hypoglossal nerve injury** | Rare unless involved by tumour. Injury → ipsilateral tongue deviation, difficulty with speech and swallowing |

### 3. Long-Term Functional Sequelae

***Head and neck cancer poses special challenges in both resection and reconstruction*** [13]. The lecture slides emphasise that management must be individualised: ***individualise the option of surgery to achieve the best functional and cosmetic result*** [13].

The three key functional domains requiring ***rehabilitation always — swallowing, voice, and hearing*** [12] are:

#### 3.1 ***Speech / Phonation*** [13]

- ***Phonation — post-laryngectomy*** [13]: As discussed, total laryngectomy eliminates the vocal source. Voice rehabilitation (TEP, oesophageal speech, electrolarynx) is essential but results in a fundamentally altered voice quality
- ***Articulation — post-glossectomy / nasal / paranasal sinus surgery*** [13]: Less relevant to laryngeal cancer specifically, but important in the broader context of H&N cancer where combined resections may affect both phonation and articulation
- Even after **partial laryngectomy or RT**, voice quality is often altered — patients may have a permanently hoarse, breathy, or rough voice

#### 3.2 Swallowing

- Dysphagia is common after treatment (surgery or CRT) due to altered anatomy, fibrosis, reduced laryngeal sensation, and impaired pharyngeal motility
- **Radiation-induced fibrosis** of the pharyngeal constrictors → reduced pharyngeal squeeze → pharyngeal residue → aspiration
- May require long-term dietary modification, swallowing exercises, or in severe cases, permanent PEG dependence

#### 3.3 Psychosocial Complications

- **Depression and anxiety**: Very common (~30–40% of H&N cancer patients). Related to disfigurement, loss of voice, social isolation, inability to eat normally, altered appearance (tracheostomy stoma)
- **Social isolation**: Difficulty communicating (voice change/loss), eating in public (dysphagia, drooling), visible stoma
- **Body image disturbance**: Permanent tracheostomy, neck scars, potential facial asymmetry from neck dissection
- **Alcohol dependence**: Many patients have pre-existing alcohol dependence that needs to be addressed

#### 3.4 Nutritional Complications

- Chronic dysphagia → inadequate oral intake → weight loss, muscle wasting
- Xerostomia (post-RT) → difficulty with dry foods, dental caries
- May require long-term PEG tube or dietary supplementation
