## Differential Diagnosis of Rectal Prolapse

> The differential diagnosis of rectal prolapse centres on one core clinical question: **"There is something protruding from or visible at the anus — what is it?"** The key differentials all present with a perianal mass, bleeding, discharge, or altered bowel habits. Your job is to distinguish them systematically using history, inspection, and examination.

---

### Overview of Key Differentials

The senior notes [2] list the following primary differentials for rectal prolapse:

- ***Prolapsed internal haemorrhoids***
- ***Rectal mucosal prolapse*** (including ***occult rectal prolapse involving intussusception*** — telescoping of bowel on itself internally without protruding through the anal verge, and thus not a true rectal prolapse)
- ***Solitary rectal ulcer***

Beyond these, a complete differential for "something protruding from/at the anus" or "anorectal mass with bleeding and altered bowel habits" also includes:

- **Anal carcinoma**
- **Rectal carcinoma (low rectal polyp/tumour)**
- **Perianal Crohn's disease**
- **Anal fissure** (shares the symptom of pain and PR bleeding)
- **Incarcerated rectal prolapse vs thrombosed prolapsed haemorrhoids** (acute painful anal mass differential) [3]

### Detailed Differential Diagnosis

#### 1. ***Prolapsed Internal Haemorrhoids*** [2][3]

This is the **most important differential** and the most commonly confused condition.

**What are haemorrhoids?** Dilated submucosal arteriovenous vascular cushions in the anal canal. Internal haemorrhoids arise **above the dentate line** from the superior rectal venous plexus (portal drainage). They classically sit at **3, 7, and 11 o'clock** positions in lithotomy (corresponding to the terminal branches of the superior rectal artery) [4].

**Why can they be confused with rectal prolapse?** Grade III and IV internal haemorrhoids prolapse through the anus and present as a protruding perianal mass — just like rectal prolapse.

**How to distinguish:**

| Feature | Full-thickness Rectal Prolapse | Prolapsed Haemorrhoids |
|---|---|---|
| **Mucosal fold pattern** | ***Concentric rings*** (circumferential, like a target) | ***Radial folds*** (spoke-like grooves between cushions) [3] |
| **Sulcus between mass and anal canal** | Present (a groove between prolapsing rectum and anal verge) | Absent (haemorrhoids are in continuity with perianal skin) |
| **Symmetry** | Circumferential, symmetric | Segmental — classically 3 separate cushions at 3, 7, 11 o'clock |
| **Layers involved** | All layers (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis, serosa) | Mucosa and submucosal vascular plexus only |
| **Bleeding pattern** | Usually minor, may have associated solitary rectal ulcer | ***Painless bright red outlet-type PR bleeding*** — blood drips into bowl, on paper [4] |
| **Faecal incontinence** | Very common (~75%) — due to chronic sphincter stretch/neuropathy | Rare |
| **Pain** | Usually painless unless incarcerated/strangulated | Usually painless unless thrombosed or incarcerated |
| **Sphincter tone** | Reduced (patulous anus) | Usually normal |

<Callout title="Exam Classic — Concentric vs Radial" type="error">
The single most tested bedside distinction: **concentric rings = rectal prolapse; radial folds = haemorrhoids**. If you see circumferential concentric mucosal rings, it is full-thickness rectal prolapse regardless of what the patient calls it.
</Callout>

#### 2. ***Rectal Mucosal Prolapse (Partial Prolapse)*** [2]

**What is it?** Only the **mucosal layer** of the rectum protrudes through the anus (unlike full-thickness prolapse where all layers protrude). The protrusion is typically < 4 cm.

**Why does it happen?** The mucosa becomes loosely attached to the underlying submucosa (lax submucosal attachments), often in the context of chronic straining. The muscularis propria stays in place — only the superficial layers slide out.

**How to distinguish from full-thickness prolapse:**

| Feature | Full-thickness Prolapse | Mucosal Prolapse |
|---|---|---|
| **Length of protrusion** | Often > 5 cm | Usually < 4 cm |
| **Folds** | Concentric rings | Radial folds (similar to haemorrhoids) |
| **Thickness on palpation** | Thick — you can feel the muscular wall between two fingers | Thin — no palpable muscular layer |
| **Sulcus** | Present between prolapse and anal verge | Absent |
| **Digital examination** | Can insert finger between prolapse and anal canal wall | Cannot — mucosa arises directly from anal canal |

**Why this matters clinically:** Mucosal prolapse is managed differently — it may respond to rubber band ligation or injection sclerotherapy (like haemorrhoids), whereas full-thickness prolapse requires surgical repair (rectopexy or perineal procedures).

#### 3. ***Occult Rectal Prolapse (Internal Intussusception)*** [2]

**What is it?** ***Telescoping of bowel on itself internally without protruding through the anal verge and thus not a true rectal prolapse*** [2]. The rectum intussuscepts into itself but the leading point does not emerge externally.

**Why does it matter?** It causes obstructed defecation symptoms (incomplete evacuation, tenesmus, straining, need for digital manoeuvres) that mimic other causes of outlet obstruction. There is **no visible external prolapse**, so it is easily missed.

**How to diagnose:** Defecography (fluoroscopic or dynamic MRI) — this is the only reliable way to identify it. On defecography, you see the rectal wall telescoping during straining.

**Clinical significance:** Internal intussusception is thought to be the **precursor** to full-thickness external prolapse — it represents an earlier point on the same disease spectrum.

#### 4. ***Solitary Rectal Ulcer (Syndrome)*** [2][5]

**What is it?** An ulcer (or sometimes a polypoid lesion) on the anterior rectal wall, typically 6–10 cm from the anal verge. Despite the name "solitary," there may be multiple ulcers.

**Why does it occur?** The leading point of the internal intussusception is subjected to repeated ischaemic pressure against the anal canal → mucosal ischaemia → ulceration. It is therefore strongly associated with internal rectal prolapse and rectal prolapse.

**Clinical features:**
- Rectal bleeding (fresh blood)
- Mucus discharge
- Straining and incomplete evacuation
- Perineal and rectal pain/pressure

**Histology** (characteristic): Fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria with smooth muscle fibres extending from the muscularis mucosae into the lamina propria, distorted crypt architecture [5].

**Why it's a differential for rectal prolapse:** It shares symptoms (bleeding, discharge, altered bowel habits) and is often found *in association with* rectal prolapse/internal intussusception. Importantly, it can mimic a rectal tumour on endoscopy — biopsy is essential.

#### 5. ***Acute Painful Anal Mass — The "Big Three"*** [3]

When a patient presents with an **acute painful anal mass**, the differential is [3]:

- ***Thrombosed prolapsed internal haemorrhoids***
- ***Thrombosed external haemorrhoids*** (a.k.a. perianal haematoma — ***present as painful bluish mass, form skin tag after 48 hours***) [3]
- ***Incarcerated rectal prolapse (with circular folds)*** [3]

This is a critical distinction because management differs:

| Condition | Key distinguishing feature | Acute management |
|---|---|---|
| Thrombosed prolapsed internal haemorrhoids | Segmental, radial folds, usually 3 cushions visible | Hyperosmolar solution / sitz bath → urgent haemorrhoidectomy if < 72 h [3] |
| Thrombosed external haemorrhoid | Bluish, tender, localised perianal mass BELOW dentate line | Incision and evacuation if < 72 h; conservative if > 72 h [3] |
| ***Incarcerated rectal prolapse*** | ***Circumferential concentric folds*** | ***Sugar application + manual reduction + surgery*** [3] |

#### 6. Anal / Low Rectal Carcinoma [6]

**Why is it in the differential?** A low rectal or anal tumour can present as a palpable/visible mass at the anus with bleeding, discharge, and altered bowel habits — similar to rectal prolapse.

***Colorectal neoplasm needs to be excluded*** [1] in any patient presenting with anorectal symptoms.

**Key distinguishing features:**
- Hard, irregular, fixed mass (vs. soft, reducible prolapse)
- Constitutional symptoms (weight loss, anorexia, night sweats)
- ***Change in stool calibre, tenesmus*** [4]
- ***Palpable inguinal lymph nodes*** (if anal carcinoma below dentate line — drains to superficial inguinal nodes) [6]
- ***Risk factors: HPV infection (90%, especially HPV-16 & 18), HIV, smoking, immunocompromised*** [6]

**Key investigation:** ***Digital rectal examination to exclude other rectal lesions*** [1][7], proctoscopy, ***rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy to exclude proximal bowel lesion*** [1][7], biopsy for histology.

#### 7. Perianal Crohn's Disease [3][5]

**Why is it a differential?** Crohn's disease can cause perianal masses (skin tags, abscesses, fistulae), bleeding, discharge, and pain — mimicking prolapse-associated symptoms.

***Always suspect perianal Crohn's disease if: non-midline fissures, recurring, multiple, unusually deep or wide, perianal hypertrophic skin tags*** [3].

**Key distinguishing features:**
- Associated systemic features (weight loss, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, oral ulcers, extraintestinal manifestations)
- Atypical fissures (off-midline, multiple)
- Complex fistulae
- Characteristic "violaceous" oedematous skin tags

#### 8. Anal Fissure [3]

**Why is it a differential?** Shares the symptoms of pain on defecation and fresh PR bleeding.

***Anal fissure = tear in the mucosal lining below the dentate line*** [3]. Most at ***6 o'clock (posterior midline) — the least perfused area*** [3].

**How to distinguish:** Fissure causes sharp, tearing pain during and after defecation with a visible linear tear on inspection. There is no protruding mass. ***Diagnosis is by spreading the buttocks to reveal the fissure — DRE and proctoscopy are painful and not indicated*** [1].
