## Management of Rectal Prolapse

> The fundamental principle of rectal prolapse management is straightforward: **surgery is the only definitive treatment for full-thickness rectal prolapse in adults**. Conservative management has a limited role — it can manage symptoms but cannot fix the underlying anatomical defect. The real decision is *which* surgical approach to use, and that depends on the patient's fitness, anatomy, and predominant symptoms (constipation vs incontinence).

---

### 1. General Principles

***Abdominal or perineal approach are both available*** [2]. The choice between them is one of the most important decisions in rectal prolapse surgery.

***Indicated in patients with sensation of mass from prolapsed bowel, fecal incontinence or constipation associated with rectal prolapse*** [2].

The two broad surgical approaches directly mirror the lecture slide categorisation [1]:

| | ***Abdominal Repair*** [1] | ***Perineal Repair*** [1] |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach** | Through the abdomen (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) | Through the perineum (no abdominal incision) |
| **Recurrence rate** | Lower (~3–9%) | Higher (~16–30%) |
| **Functional outcomes** | Better continence and constipation outcomes | Acceptable but inferior long-term function |
| **Operative morbidity** | Higher (general anaesthesia, abdominal access) | Lower (can be done under regional/spinal anaesthesia) |
| **Best for** | Fit patients, younger patients, those with significant constipation | Elderly/frail patients, high anaesthetic risk, recurrent prolapse after abdominal repair |

<Callout title="The Core Decision">
**Fit patient → abdominal approach (better long-term outcomes, lower recurrence).**
**Frail/elderly/high-risk patient → perineal approach (lower operative morbidity, tolerable under regional anaesthesia).**
This is the single most important management principle to remember.

### 3. Conservative Management

Conservative management does **not** cure full-thickness rectal prolapse. It is reserved for:
- **Children** — most paediatric rectal prolapse resolves spontaneously by age 5
- **Internal intussusception** (without external prolapse) — trial of conservative therapy first
- **Patients unfit for any surgery** — symptom palliation only
- **Perioperative optimisation** — managing constipation and incontinence before and after surgery

#### 3.1 Dietary and Lifestyle Modifications

| Measure | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **High-fibre diet + adequate fluid intake** | Softens stool → reduces straining → reduces repetitive pelvic floor descent |
| **Stool softeners / Bulk-forming laxatives** (e.g., psyllium, lactulose) | Same as above; prevents hard stools that require Valsalva |
| **Avoidance of prolonged straining** | Reduces further pudendal nerve stretch and pelvic floor descent |
| **Toilet posture advice** (feet on stool, slight forward lean) | Straightens the anorectal angle → facilitates evacuation without excessive straining |

#### 3.2 Pelvic Floor Rehabilitation / Biofeedback

- **Biofeedback therapy**: The patient uses manometric or EMG feedback to learn to relax the puborectalis during defecation and strengthen the EAS during holding
- **Why it helps**: In patients with paradoxical puborectalis contraction (dyssynergic defecation), biofeedback retrains the coordination of pelvic floor muscles → reduces outlet obstruction → reduces straining
- **Evidence**: Primarily used for internal intussusception and obstructed defecation; limited evidence for full-thickness external prolapse

#### 3.3 Management of Incarcerated Rectal Prolapse (Emergency)

***Incarcerated rectal prolapse: sugar application + manual reduction + surgery*** [3]

**Step-by-step approach:**
1. **Osmotic reduction**: Apply **granulated sugar** (or table salt) liberally to the oedematous, congested, prolapsed mucosa
   - *Why sugar?* The hyperosmolar crystals draw interstitial fluid out of the oedematous tissue via osmosis → reduces swelling → makes the prolapse smaller and softer
   - Leave in place for 15–20 minutes while gently compressing with gauze
2. **Manual reduction**: Once oedema has reduced, gently push the prolapse back through the anus using steady circumferential pressure (start at the apex and work proximally)
3. **Assess viability**: If mucosa is **dusky/black/necrotic** → suspect strangulation → **do not attempt reduction** → urgent surgery
4. **Definitive surgery**: Plan elective surgery after successful reduction; if reduction fails or tissue is non-viable → urgent perineal procedure (typically Altemeier)

### 4. Surgical Treatment — Abdominal Approaches

The lecture slides [1] list the abdominal repair options as:

- ***Rectal fixation (suture/mesh)*** [1]
- ***Sigmoid resection*** [1]
- ***Proctectomy*** [1]
- ***Combination of rectal fixation and sigmoid resection*** [1]
- ***Laparoscopic vs. open vs. robotic*** [1]

#### 4.1 ***Rectopexy*** [2]

> "Recto-" = rectum; "-pexy" = surgical fixation. You're fixing the rectum back to where it belongs.

**Principle**: ***Affix pararectal tissues to the presacral fascia or sacral periosteum in the sacral promontory using non-absorbable sutures or mesh*** [2]

**Why does this work?** The rectum has lost its normal fixation to the sacrum (loss of lateral ligaments, mesorectal fascia). Rectopexy restores this fixation by creating a fibrotic adhesion between the mobilised rectum and the presacral fascia at the level of the sacral promontory → the rectum can no longer slide down.

**Types of rectopexy:**

| Type | Description | Key features |
|---|---|---|
| **Suture rectopexy** | Sutures alone fix the lateral rectal stalks to the presacral fascia | Simple; lower cost; no foreign material; adequate for many patients |
| **Mesh rectopexy (posterior)** | A synthetic or biological mesh is placed posterior to the rectum and sutured to the sacral promontory (like the Ripstein or Wells procedure) | Promotes fibrosis; historically higher rates of constipation (mesh can kink or compress the rectum) |
| ***Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR)*** | Mesh placed on the **anterior** aspect of the rectum only, sutured to the sacral promontory; posterior rectal dissection is **avoided** | ***Currently the preferred technique*** [1] — see below |

##### ***Laparoscopic Ventral Mesh Rectopexy (LVMR)*** [1]

This is the modern "gold standard" for abdominal rectopexy and deserves special attention.

**Technique**: A biological or synthetic mesh is placed on the anterior wall of the rectum (in the rectovaginal/rectovesical septum), extending from the level of the Pouch of Douglas down to the perineal body, and fixed superiorly to the sacral promontory. The posterior aspect of the rectum is **not** mobilised.

**Why ventral (anterior) rather than posterior?**
- Avoids posterior rectal mobilisation → preserves the lateral ligaments and autonomic nerves → lower risk of new-onset constipation and sexual dysfunction
- Specifically addresses the deep cul-de-sac (obliterates the Pouch of Douglas) and supports the anterior rectal wall where intussusception typically begins

***Systematic review in 2010 of 12 non-randomised studies — 728 patients*** [1]:
- ***Recurrence of 3.4%*** [1]
- ***Improvement in incontinence of 45%*** [1]
- ***Improvement in constipation of 24%*** [1]

**Indications:**
- Full-thickness rectal prolapse in fit patients
- Internal rectal prolapse (high-grade intussusception) refractory to conservative management
- Multi-compartment pelvic organ prolapse (simultaneously addresses enterocele/rectocele)

**Contraindications (relative):**
- Unfit for general anaesthesia / laparoscopy
- Previous extensive pelvic surgery with dense adhesions (relative)
- Active pelvic sepsis (absolute — mesh infection risk)

<Callout title="Why LVMR is the preferred abdominal approach">
LVMR has emerged as the procedure of choice because it combines low recurrence (~3.4%), functional improvement in both constipation AND incontinence, avoids posterior dissection (preserving autonomic nerves), and can be performed laparoscopically with rapid recovery. It specifically targets the pathological anatomy — the deep cul-de-sac and anterior intussusception.
</Callout>

#### 4.2 ***Sigmoid Resection*** [1][2]

***Resection of sigmoid colon in patients if it is redundant*** [2]
***Use as an adjunct to rectopexy to improve postoperative bowel function in patients with constipation*** [2]

**Technique**: The redundant sigmoid colon is resected and a colorectal anastomosis is performed, combined with rectopexy (= **resection rectopexy**, e.g., Frykman-Goldberg procedure).

**Why add sigmoid resection?**
- A ***redundant sigmoid*** [1] acts as a reservoir for stool → promotes constipation and provides the "weight" that pushes the rectum down
- In patients with **slow transit constipation** (confirmed on colonic transit study), removing the redundant sigmoid reduces the colonic reservoir → improves transit → reduces postoperative constipation
- Without sigmoid resection, constipation often **worsens** after rectopexy because the now-fixed rectum can no longer accommodate the slow-transit stool bolus

**Indications:**
- Rectal prolapse **with significant constipation** and redundant sigmoid
- Colonic transit study showing slow transit constipation
- Rectopexy alone would likely worsen constipation

**Contraindications:**
- Patients with predominant faecal incontinence (resection shortens the colon → looser stools → may worsen incontinence)
- Patients with diarrhoea-predominant symptoms

<Callout title="The Constipation vs Incontinence Decision" type="error">
This is a critical surgical planning decision: **If the main symptom is constipation → consider adding sigmoid resection. If the main symptom is incontinence → do NOT resect sigmoid** (removing colon makes stools looser → worsens incontinence). Get a colonic transit study before deciding.
</Callout>

#### 4.3 ***Proctectomy*** [1]

Listed on the lecture slides as an abdominal option [1]. This is **rarely performed** for rectal prolapse alone and is reserved for:
- Recurrent rectal prolapse after multiple failed repairs
- Concomitant rectal pathology (e.g., rectal cancer, severe radiation proctitis)
- Results in a permanent colostomy — significant quality of life implications

#### 4.4 ***Other Abdominal Approaches*** [1]

***Suture, Mesh, Resection*** [1] — these can be combined in various permutations:

| Combination | When to use |
|---|---|
| Suture rectopexy alone | Prolapse without constipation; mesh not desired |
| Mesh rectopexy alone (posterior or ventral) | Prolapse, especially with multi-compartment involvement |
| Resection + suture rectopexy | Prolapse with constipation and redundant sigmoid |
| Resection + mesh rectopexy | Prolapse with constipation, multi-compartment prolapse, and redundant sigmoid |

***Laparoscopic vs. open vs. robotic*** [1]:
- **Laparoscopic** approach is now standard — shorter hospital stay, less pain, faster recovery, equivalent recurrence rates
- **Robotic** approach increasingly used for LVMR — enhanced visualisation and dexterity in the pelvis; higher cost but similar outcomes
- **Open** approach reserved for patients with contraindications to laparoscopy (e.g., extensive adhesions, inability to tolerate pneumoperitoneum)

---

### 5. Surgical Treatment — Perineal Approaches

The lecture slides [1] list the perineal repair options as:

- ***Full thickness resection*** [1]
- ***Mucosal resection with muscular reefing*** [1]
- ***Anal encirclement*** [1]

#### 5.1 ***Altemeier Procedure (Perineal Rectosigmoidectomy)*** [1][3]

> ***Full thickness resection*** [1] via the perineal route.

**Technique**: The prolapsed rectum is everted, and a full-thickness resection of the redundant rectosigmoid is performed through the perineum. A hand-sewn or stapled coloanal anastomosis is then created. A levatorplasty (plication of the levator ani muscles posterior to the rectum) is usually added to reinforce the pelvic floor.

***Altemeier's operation (perineal rectosigmoidectomy)*** [3]

**Why does it work?**
- Removes the redundant, prolapsing bowel
- The subsequent fibrosis/scarring fixes the neo-rectum in place
- Levatorplasty narrows the levator hiatus → provides additional pelvic floor support

**Indications:**
- **Elderly/frail patients** unfit for abdominal surgery
- **Incarcerated or strangulated prolapse** requiring emergency surgery (can be performed without laparotomy)
- **Recurrent prolapse** after abdominal repair (avoids re-entering the abdomen)
- Can be performed under **regional/spinal anaesthesia** — major advantage in high-risk patients

**Contraindications:**
- Relative: young, fit patients (higher recurrence rate than abdominal approach)

**Advantages**: Low operative morbidity, can be done under regional anaesthesia, no abdominal incision
**Disadvantages**: Higher recurrence rate (~16–30%), potential for anastomotic leak, may not address constipation

#### 5.2 ***Delorme Procedure*** [1][3]

> ***Mucosal resection with muscular reefing*** [1].

***Delorme procedure: plication (folding) of sutures*** [3]

**Technique**: The mucosa of the prolapsed rectum is stripped off circumferentially, and the denuded muscularis propria is then plicated (folded/reefed) with serial sutures like an accordion. The mucosal edges are then re-anastomosed.

**Why does it work?**
- Mucosal stripping + muscular plication shortens and "thickens" the rectal wall
- Creates a bulky muscular cuff at the anorectal junction → acts as a physical barrier to re-prolapse
- The plication narrows the rectal lumen → improves continence by providing a better "plug"

**Indications:**
- **Short prolapse** (< 3–4 cm) — works best for smaller prolapses
- Elderly/frail patients (similar rationale to Altemeier)
- **Mucosal prolapse** (partial prolapse) rather than full-thickness
- Internal intussusception (selected cases)

**Contraindications:**
- Large, full-thickness prolapse (inadequate correction with plication alone)

**Advantages**: No bowel resection → no anastomotic leak risk; very low morbidity; can be done under local/regional anaesthesia
**Disadvantages**: Highest recurrence rate of all procedures (~20–38%); less effective for large prolapses

#### 5.3 ***Anal Encirclement (Thiersch Procedure)*** [1]

> ***Anal encirclement*** [1] — a wire, silastic band, or synthetic mesh strip is placed subcutaneously around the anal canal to narrow the anal orifice.

**Technique**: A circumferential subcutaneous suture or band is placed around the anal canal (outside the sphincter complex) to mechanically narrow the anal opening and prevent the rectum from prolapsing through it.

**Why is it rarely used?**
- It does **not** address the underlying pathology (the rectum is still intussuscepting — you've just narrowed the "exit")
- High complication rates: faecal impaction (too tight), infection, erosion through skin, breakage
- High recurrence rate once the encirclement fails or is removed
- Does not improve continence

**Current indications:**
- Extremely frail/moribund patients unfit for any other surgery — purely palliative
- Occasionally used as a temporary measure to prevent re-prolapse while awaiting definitive surgery

---

### 6. Special Populations

#### 6.1 Children

- **Most childhood rectal prolapse resolves with conservative management** by age 5
- Treatment: stool softeners, dietary fibre, avoidance of straining, treat underlying cause (CF, whooping cough, malnutrition)
- **Manual reduction** taught to parents — gentle, sustained pressure with lubricated gauze
- **Surgery** only if prolapse persists despite conservative management for > 1 year, or if it becomes recurrent and irreducible
- Procedures: submucosal injection sclerotherapy (creates fibrosis to fix mucosa), laparoscopic rectopexy (rare, for persistent cases)

#### 6.2 Internal Intussusception (Without External Prolapse)

- **First-line**: Conservative management — biofeedback, pelvic floor rehabilitation, dietary modifications, laxatives for constipation
- **Surgery** only if refractory to conservative measures and symptoms are significantly impacting quality of life
- Preferred procedure: ***Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy*** [1] — addresses the intussusception and deep cul-de-sac while avoiding posterior dissection

### 7. Comparison of Surgical Procedures — Summary Table

| Procedure | Approach | Recurrence | Continence improvement | Constipation outcome | Best for | Anaesthesia |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***LVMR*** [1] | Abdominal (laparoscopic) | ***~3.4%*** [1] | ***~45% improvement*** [1] | ***~24% improvement*** [1] | Fit patients; multi-compartment prolapse | GA |
| **Suture rectopexy** | Abdominal | ~3–9% | Moderate | May worsen (if posterior mobilisation) | Fit patients without constipation | GA |
| **Resection rectopexy** | Abdominal | ~2–5% | Good | Good (removes redundant sigmoid) | Prolapse + constipation + redundant sigmoid | GA |
| ***Altemeier*** [3] | Perineal | ~16–30% | Moderate (improved with levatorplasty) | Variable | Frail/elderly; emergency; recurrent after abdominal repair | Regional/Spinal |
| ***Delorme*** [3] | Perineal | ~20–38% | Moderate | Variable | Short prolapse; mucosal prolapse; frail patients | Regional/Local |
| ***Thiersch*** [1] | Perineal | Very high | None | May worsen (impaction) | Palliative only; extremely frail patients | Local |

---

### 8. Postoperative Considerations

| Issue | Details |
|---|---|
| **Recurrence** | Most common complication overall; higher with perineal approaches; counsel patient pre-operatively |
| **New-onset/worsened constipation** | Especially after posterior rectopexy (denervation of rectum during posterior mobilisation); mitigated by LVMR (no posterior dissection) or by adding sigmoid resection |
| **Faecal incontinence persistence** | May persist despite anatomical correction if pudendal neuropathy is severe (prolonged PNTML); biofeedback and pelvic floor rehab postoperatively |
| **Mesh-related complications** | Infection, erosion (into rectum or vagina), chronic pain, dyspareunia; use biological mesh to reduce erosion risk; avoid mesh in contaminated field |
| **Anastomotic leak** | Risk with Altemeier or resection rectopexy; presents with pelvic sepsis, fever, pain |
| **Pelvic floor rehabilitation** | Important adjunct to all surgical approaches — pelvic floor exercises, biofeedback, dietary advice continue postoperatively |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Surgery is the definitive treatment** for full-thickness rectal prolapse — conservative measures alone cannot fix it (except in children).
2. **Two broad approaches**: ***Abdominal repair*** (lower recurrence, better function, needs GA) vs ***Perineal repair*** (higher recurrence, lower morbidity, can be done under regional anaesthesia).
3. ***Abdominal options***: Rectal fixation (suture/mesh), Sigmoid resection, Proctectomy, Combination of fixation + resection. Approach: laparoscopic vs open vs robotic.
4. ***Perineal options***: Full-thickness resection (Altemeier), Mucosal resection with muscular reefing (Delorme), Anal encirclement (Thiersch — rarely used).
5. ***LVMR is the preferred abdominal technique*** — recurrence 3.4%, improvement in incontinence 45%, improvement in constipation 24%.
6. ***Add sigmoid resection*** if patient has constipation with redundant sigmoid / slow transit on colonic transit study. **Do NOT resect** if predominant symptom is incontinence.
7. **Incarcerated rectal prolapse**: sugar application → manual reduction → elective surgery. If strangulated → urgent perineal procedure.
8. ***Rectopexy = affix pararectal tissues to presacral fascia/sacral periosteum at the sacral promontory using non-absorbable sutures or mesh***.
9. **Frail/elderly patients → perineal approach** (Altemeier or Delorme); **fit patients → abdominal approach** (LVMR or resection rectopexy).
