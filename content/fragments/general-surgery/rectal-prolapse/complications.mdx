## Complications of Rectal Prolapse

> Complications of rectal prolapse can be divided into two broad categories: (A) **complications of the disease itself** (what happens if you leave the prolapse untreated or it progresses), and (B) **complications of surgical treatment** (what can go wrong after repair). Both are clinically important and frequently tested. Let's work through each systematically, always linking back to the underlying mechanism.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease (Untreated Rectal Prolapse)

These are the natural consequences of a rectum that is chronically prolapsing through the anus. They progress over time if the prolapse is not addressed.

#### 1. Faecal Incontinence

***Incontinence*** [1] is the most functionally devastating complication and is present in **up to 75%** of patients with rectal prolapse [2].

**Why does it happen?** Three mechanisms work in concert:

| Mechanism | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Chronic mechanical sphincter stretch** | The prolapsing rectal mass repeatedly dilates the anal sphincter complex → the sphincter becomes permanently patulous and loses resting tone |
| ***Pudendal neuropathy*** [1] | Chronic straining and excessive perineal descent stretch the pudendal nerve (S2–S4) around the ischial spine → denervation of the external anal sphincter → loss of voluntary squeeze |
| **Loss of anorectal angle** | ***Levator ani diastasis*** [1] and puborectalis weakening → loss of the normal ~90° anorectal angle → loss of the "flap-valve" continence mechanism |

**Clinical significance:** Even after successful surgical repair, incontinence may **persist** if pudendal neuropathy is severe (prolonged PNTML > 2.0 ms bilaterally). This is why pre-operative pelvic physiology studies are important for counselling.

#### 2. Chronic Constipation and Obstructed Defecation

***Constipation*** [1] affects 15–65% of patients [2].

**Why does it happen?**
- The internal intussusception acts as a **mechanical plug** — the telescoped rectal wall obstructs the passage of stool (outlet obstruction)
- A ***redundant sigmoid*** [1] creates a long, tortuous colonic pathway → slow transit
- Paradoxical puborectalis contraction (dyssynergic defecation) — the puborectalis contracts instead of relaxing during defecation → functional outlet obstruction
- Patients compensate by **straining harder** → further pelvic floor descent → further pudendal nerve injury → a vicious cycle

**Clinical significance:** Constipation is both a **cause** and a **consequence** of rectal prolapse — treating one without the other leads to ongoing symptoms. This is why colonic transit studies are performed pre-operatively.

#### 3. Incarceration

**What is it?** The prolapsed rectum cannot be manually reduced back through the anus. The prolapse becomes "trapped" outside.

**Why does it happen?** Once the rectum prolapses externally, venous and lymphatic drainage are obstructed by the constricting anal sphincter ring → oedema develops in the prolapsed tissue → the swollen tissue becomes too large to push back through the sphincter → a vicious cycle of congestion and swelling.

**Management:** ***Incarcerated rectal prolapse: sugar application + manual reduction + surgery*** [3]. Sugar draws out oedema fluid osmotically, shrinking the tissue enough to allow reduction.

#### 4. Strangulation and Gangrene

**What is it?** This is the progression beyond incarceration. If an incarcerated prolapse is not reduced, arterial blood supply is eventually compromised → ischaemia → tissue necrosis (gangrene).

**Why does it happen?**
- Initially, only venous/lymphatic outflow is obstructed (the lower-pressure system) → congestion and oedema
- As oedema increases → compartment-like effect → eventually arterial inflow is also compromised
- Without arterial supply → mucosal then full-thickness ischaemia → gangrene → perforation → sepsis

**Clinical features of strangulation:**
- The prolapsed tissue becomes **dusky, dark purple, or black** (compared to the normal pink/red of a viable prolapse)
- Severe pain (ischaemic pain)
- Systemic signs: tachycardia, fever, leucocytosis

**This is a surgical emergency.** If the tissue is non-viable, **do not attempt reduction** (risk of reducing necrotic/perforated bowel into the abdomen → peritonitis). Proceed directly to **urgent perineal resection** (Altemeier procedure).

<Callout title="Incarceration → Strangulation Spectrum" type="error">
This is analogous to any other hernia. Think of incarcerated rectal prolapse like a strangulated inguinal hernia — first venous congestion, then arterial compromise, then gangrene. The management principle is the same: reduce if viable, resect if non-viable. Never reduce gangrenous tissue back into the abdomen.

#### 5. Mucosal Ulceration and Bleeding

***Bleeding*** [1] and ***Discharge*** [1]

**Why does it happen?**
- The exposed rectal mucosa is subjected to **mechanical friction** against clothing and the skin → traumatic erosion
- Venous and lymphatic congestion of the prolapsed segment → mucosal oedema → fragile, easily traumatised mucosa
- **Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS)**: the leading point of the intussusception is compressed against the anal canal during straining → localised mucosal ischaemia → ulceration (typically anterior rectal wall, 6–10 cm from anal verge)

**Clinical features:** Fresh PR bleeding (usually minor), mucus discharge, perianal soiling and excoriation.

#### 6. Solitary Rectal Ulcer Syndrome (SRUS)

This deserves separate mention as it is both a consequence and an associated condition.

**Mechanism:** Internal intussusception → the leading edge of the intussusceptum is repeatedly compressed against the anal canal → localised ischaemic pressure necrosis → mucosal ulceration. Additionally, direct digital trauma from patients using digital manoeuvres contributes.

**Histology:** Fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria (pathognomonic) — smooth muscle fibres from the muscularis mucosae extend upward into the lamina propria.

**Clinical significance:** Can mimic a rectal tumour on endoscopy → biopsy is essential to differentiate. Treating the underlying prolapse often resolves the SRUS.

#### 7. Multi-Compartment Pelvic Organ Prolapse

***Concomitant pelvic floor pathology — Cystocele / Rectocele / Uterine prolapse*** [2]

**Why does it happen?** Rectal prolapse is a manifestation of global pelvic floor weakness. The same levator ani diastasis and pudendal neuropathy that cause rectal prolapse also weaken the supports for the bladder (anterior compartment) and uterus/vaginal vault (middle compartment).

**Clinical significance:**
- **Cystocele** → urinary stress incontinence, urinary retention, recurrent UTIs
- **Uterine prolapse** → sensation of vaginal mass, dragging discomfort
- **Enterocele** → deep pelvic pressure, obstructed defecation (small bowel herniating into rectovaginal space pushes on rectum)
- Must be identified pre-operatively to plan **multi-compartment repair** (e.g., LVMR addresses the posterior compartment and obliterates the Pouch of Douglas)

#### 8. Perianal Skin Complications

**Chronic mucus discharge and stool soiling** → perianal maceration, excoriation, contact dermatitis, pruritus ani, and secondary fungal/bacterial infection of the perianal skin.

### B. Complications of Surgical Treatment

Complications vary by approach (abdominal vs perineal) and specific procedure. Organised by timing:

#### Early Complications (< 30 days)

| Complication | Mechanism | Relevant procedures | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Surgical site infection** [5] | Contamination from bowel flora during rectal/sigmoid mobilisation or resection | All procedures | Wound care, antibiotics; I&D if abscess |
| **Postoperative ileus** [5] | Bowel handling, anaesthesia, electrolyte imbalance → temporary loss of coordinated peristalsis | Abdominal approaches | Conservative: NG tube, IV fluids, correction of electrolytes, early mobilisation |
| **Urinary retention** [4] | Pelvic dissection → oedema/inflammation near bladder and pelvic autonomic nerves; pain and opioid analgesia → detrusor inhibition | Both approaches; especially abdominal procedures with extensive pelvic dissection | Catheterisation for 24–48 hours |
| **Haemorrhage / Reactionary bleeding** | Presacral venous plexus injury (during posterior rectal mobilisation); mesenteric vessel injury | Abdominal rectopexy, resection rectopexy | Pressure, haemostatic agents, transfusion; reoperation if severe |
| ***Anastomotic leak*** [4][5] | Ischaemia at the anastomotic line, tension, poor technique, patient factors (malnutrition, steroids, diabetes) | **Altemeier procedure** (perineal coloanal anastomosis), **Resection rectopexy** (colorectal anastomosis) | Becomes apparent **5–7 days postoperatively** [5]; signs: pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent/purulent drainage. Management: IV antibiotics, bowel rest, percutaneous drainage of collections, proximal faecal diversion if needed |
| **Injury to neighbouring structures** [4] | Iatrogenic damage during pelvic dissection | Abdominal approaches | — |
| — ***Autonomic nerve injury*** [4] | Damage to hypogastric nerves (sympathetic) or pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic) during posterior rectal mobilisation | Posterior mesh rectopexy, resection rectopexy | Sympathetic injury → ejaculatory dysfunction, incontinence. Parasympathetic injury → urinary retention, erectile dysfunction. This is why **LVMR avoids posterior dissection** |
| — **Ureteral injury** [4][5] | Left ureter runs close to the sigmoid mesentery and may be injured during sigmoid mobilisation/resection | Resection rectopexy | Intraoperative repair; ureteric stenting |

#### Late Complications (> 30 days)

| Complication | Mechanism | Relevant procedures | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recurrence of prolapse** | The most common long-term complication overall. Failure of the repair to adequately fix the rectum. Risk factors: perineal approach, inadequate rectopexy, ongoing straining, severe pelvic floor weakness | All procedures — higher with perineal approaches (16–38%) than abdominal (~3–9%) | Repeat surgery; may switch approach (e.g., abdominal after failed perineal, or vice versa) |
| **New-onset or worsened constipation** | Posterior rectal mobilisation → division of lateral ligaments → denervation of rectum → impaired rectal motility. Mesh placed posteriorly can kink/compress the rectum. Fixed rectum can no longer accommodate stool bolus if sigmoid redundancy persists | Posterior mesh rectopexy (Ripstein, Wells); suture rectopexy without sigmoid resection | Laxatives, biofeedback. Prevention: use LVMR (avoids posterior dissection); add sigmoid resection if transit is slow |
| **Persistent faecal incontinence** | Pre-existing severe pudendal neuropathy does not recover even after anatomical correction. Irreversible sphincter damage | All procedures | Biofeedback, pelvic floor rehabilitation, sacral nerve stimulation; consider colostomy if refractory |
| **Mesh-related complications** | Foreign body → chronic inflammatory reaction → erosion into adjacent structures (rectum, vagina); infection; chronic pelvic pain; dyspareunia | Mesh rectopexy (posterior or ventral) | Mesh removal (difficult); antibiotics for infection. Use biological mesh to reduce erosion risk; avoid synthetic mesh in contaminated fields |
| ***Anastomotic stricture*** [4][5] | Excessive scarring/fibrosis at the anastomotic line → luminal narrowing | Altemeier procedure, resection rectopexy | ***Finger dilatation for low anastomosis; endoscopic balloon dilatation for high anastomosis*** [5] |
| ***Fistula*** [4][5] | Anastomotic breakdown → communication between bowel and adjacent structure | Altemeier, resection rectopexy | ***Enterocutaneous fistula: conservative management (most close spontaneously)*** [5]. ***Rectovaginal or rectourinary fistula: proximal faecal diversion*** [4][5] |
| **Anal encirclement (Thiersch) specific** | Band too tight → faecal impaction; band too loose → recurrence; infection; erosion through perianal skin; band breakage | Thiersch procedure | Removal of encirclement device; definitive surgical repair |

<Callout title="Why LVMR has fewer complications than posterior rectopexy">
Posterior rectopexy requires mobilisation of the rectum posteriorly, which risks damage to the lateral ligaments (containing the middle rectal vessels and autonomic nerves) and the presacral venous plexus. This causes new-onset constipation (denervation) and haemorrhage. LVMR avoids posterior dissection entirely — the mesh is placed anteriorly in the rectovaginal/rectovesical septum — preserving autonomic innervation and reducing constipation. This is the fundamental reason for the shift toward ventral mesh rectopexy in modern practice.

#### Procedure-Specific Complication Summary

| Procedure | Unique/Key Complications |
|---|---|
| ***LVMR*** [1] | Mesh erosion (into vagina/rectum), mesh infection, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia. ***Recurrence ~3.4%*** [1] |
| **Posterior mesh rectopexy** | New-onset constipation (posterior dissection), presacral haemorrhage, mesh complications |
| **Resection rectopexy** | Anastomotic leak, anastomotic stricture, fistula, ureteral injury, autonomic nerve injury |
| ***Altemeier*** [3] | Anastomotic leak (perineal), anastomotic stricture, recurrence (16–30%), pelvic sepsis |
| ***Delorme*** [3] | Highest recurrence (20–38%); mucosal dehiscence; minimal other complications |
| ***Thiersch*** [1] | Faecal impaction, infection, erosion, band breakage, very high recurrence |

### C. Psychological and Quality-of-Life Impact

Often overlooked but clinically significant:

- **Social isolation**: chronic faecal incontinence and soiling → embarrassment → withdrawal from social activities
- **Depression and anxiety**: particularly in elderly patients; multifactorial — incontinence, chronic pain, body image, functional limitation
- **Sexual dysfunction**: both from the disease itself (prolapse during intercourse, incontinence) and from surgery (autonomic nerve injury → erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory failure, dyspareunia from mesh erosion)
- **Nutritional impact**: patients may restrict food intake to reduce stool frequency and soiling → weight loss, malnutrition (especially in elderly)

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Complications of the disease**: faecal incontinence (up to 75%), constipation/obstructed defecation, incarceration, strangulation/gangrene (surgical emergency), mucosal ulceration/bleeding, solitary rectal ulcer, multi-compartment pelvic organ prolapse, perianal skin complications.
2. **Incarceration → strangulation sequence**: venous congestion → oedema → arterial compromise → gangrene. Manage with sugar application → manual reduction if viable; urgent perineal resection if non-viable.
3. **Surgical complications**: recurrence (most common overall — higher with perineal approaches), new-onset constipation (posterior dissection), persistent incontinence (pudendal neuropathy), anastomotic leak/stricture/fistula, mesh erosion, autonomic nerve injury (sexual/urinary dysfunction), haemorrhage.
4. **Autonomic nerve injury** during posterior rectal mobilisation → sympathetic damage (ejaculatory dysfunction) or parasympathetic damage (urinary retention, erectile dysfunction). LVMR avoids this by using an anterior-only approach.
5. **Anastomotic leak** becomes apparent 5–7 days post-op; presents with pain, fever, tachycardia, feculent drainage.
6. **Mesh complications**: erosion (into rectum/vagina), infection, chronic pain, dyspareunia. Use biological mesh to minimise risk.
7. **Recurrence rates**: LVMR ~3.4%; abdominal suture/resection rectopexy ~3–9%; Altemeier ~16–30%; Delorme ~20–38%.
