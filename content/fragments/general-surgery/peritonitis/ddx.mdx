## Differential Diagnosis of Peritonitis

### Why Is the Differential Diagnosis of Peritonitis Important?

Peritonitis is not a single disease — it is a **clinical syndrome** (inflammation of the peritoneum) that can be caused by dozens of different conditions. When a patient presents with peritoneal signs (***tenderness, guarding, rebound***) [1], your job is twofold:

1. **Confirm peritonitis** — could the peritoneal signs be mimicked by something else (e.g., abdominal wall pathology, retroperitoneal disease, medical causes)?
2. **Identify the underlying cause** — because management differs dramatically (e.g., SBP = antibiotics alone vs. perforated viscus = emergency surgery).

The DDx is best approached systematically by thinking about **what can irritate the peritoneum** from first principles: (a) things that perforate/leak into the peritoneal cavity, (b) organs that inflame and involve the adjacent peritoneum, (c) primary peritoneal disease, and (d) "mimics" — conditions that look like peritonitis but aren't.

### Framework for Differential Diagnosis

I'll organize this in two layers:

**Layer 1 — Differentiating BETWEEN the causes of peritonitis** (i.e., once you know the peritoneum is inflamed, what's the aetiology?)

**Layer 2 — Differentiating peritonitis FROM its mimics** (i.e., conditions that present similarly but the peritoneum is not the primary problem)

---

### Layer 1: Causes of Peritonitis — Differential by Type

This is essentially the aetiological differential: "What caused the peritonitis?"

#### A. Primary Peritonitis

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|
| ***Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP)*** | History of ***liver cirrhosis and ascites*** [1][2]. Fever, abdominal pain, altered mental status. Ascitic fluid PMN ≥ 250 cells/mm³, **monomicrobial** culture. **No** free gas on imaging. ***Risk factors: ascites, malnutrition, immunosuppression, CLD, CKD, splenectomy, intra-abdominal malignancy*** [1]. |
| ***Tuberculous peritonitis*** | ***Presentation may be non-specific: low-grade fever, weight loss, insidious onset of abdominal pain*** [1]. ***Peritoneal signs not florid*** [1]. Ascitic fluid is **lymphocyte-predominant** (not neutrophil-predominant like SBP), high protein ( > 2.5 g/dL), elevated ADA. ***AFB smear often negative; culture takes 4–6 weeks (could be falsely negative)*** [1]. ***Diagnosis often made by laparoscopy and biopsy of peritoneum*** [1]. HK context: intermediate TB burden, consider in immigrants/immunosuppressed. |
| ***CAPD-associated peritonitis*** | Patient on **peritoneal dialysis** with **turbid PD effluent**, abdominal pain ± fever [2]. PD fluid WBC ≥ 100/mm³ with > 50% PMN. Look for **exit-site infection** (erythema, discharge at catheter site). Organisms: coagulase-negative Staph (from skin), *S. aureus*, Gram-negatives [2]. |

<Callout title="SBP vs. Secondary Peritonitis in a Cirrhotic Patient — Critical Distinction" type="error">
Both can present identically in a cirrhotic patient with ascites. If you culture **multiple** organisms from the ascitic fluid, or if Runyon's criteria are met (protein > 1 g/dL, glucose < 50 mg/dL, LDH > ULN for serum [2]), think **secondary peritonitis** — this patient needs surgery, not just antibiotics. Missing a perforation in a cirrhotic is a classic fatal error.
</Callout>

#### B. Secondary Peritonitis — The Main Differentials

***Accounts for most peritonitis*** [1]. The differential here is essentially: **which organ has perforated, become ischaemic, or is severely inflamed?**

##### By Mechanism: Perforation

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|
| **Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU)** | Sudden-onset severe epigastric pain → rapidly becomes diffuse. History of dyspepsia, NSAID/steroid use, *H. pylori*. ***Board-like rigidity*** (chemical peritonitis from gastric acid). **Free gas under diaphragm on erect CXR** is the classic finding. ***Chemical peritonitis preceded by bacterial peritonitis*** [1] — gastric acid initially sterile, secondary infection follows in 6–12 hours. |
| **Perforated appendicitis** | Initial periumbilical pain → migrating to RIF (the classic visceral → somatic shift). Fever, anorexia, nausea. McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign [5]. If perforation occurs → generalised peritonitis with diffuse tenderness and guarding. Peak age 20s–30s [2]. ***Grade 5: Perforated with diffuse peritonitis*** [2]. |
| **Perforated diverticulitis** | LIF pain (or RIF in ***Asian population with right-sided diverticular disease*** [2]). History of altered bowel habit, older age (mean 63 years [2]). CT: bowel wall thickening, pericolonic fat stranding ± free gas/fluid. ***Hinchey III = generalised purulent peritonitis; Hinchey IV = generalised faecal peritonitis*** [2][6]. |
| **Perforated colorectal cancer** | May present acutely with peritonitis. History of weight loss, altered bowel habit, PR bleeding, iron-deficiency anaemia. CT: mass lesion with perforation. ***Similar features to diverticulitis on imaging — CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation*** [2]. |
| ***Perforations of GI tract: spontaneous, trauma, iatrogenic*** | Post-colonoscopy perforation (iatrogenic), blunt/penetrating abdominal trauma, spontaneous perforation of stercoral ulcer in severe constipation [1]. |
| **Boerhaave syndrome** | Perforation of oesophagus (usually distal) after forceful vomiting. Severe chest/epigastric pain, subcutaneous emphysema, Hamman's sign (mediastinal crunch). Leads to mediastinitis ± peritonitis if perforation is below diaphragm. |

##### By Mechanism: Severe Inflammation

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|
| ***Cholecystitis*** | RUQ pain, fever, Murphy's sign (+ve). Inflammatory process may remain localised or spread to involve the peritoneum (localised peritonitis → diffuse if perforated). USG: thickened GB wall, pericholecystic fluid, gallstones [1]. |
| ***Cholangitis*** | Charcot's triad: fever + jaundice + RUQ pain. Reynold's pentad adds hypotension + confusion (sepsis). Biliary obstruction → ascending infection. |
| ***Pancreatitis*** | Epigastric pain radiating to back, relieved by leaning forward. Markedly elevated serum amylase/lipase ( > 3× ULN). ***Could be preceded by chemical peritonitis*** [1] — pancreatic enzymes leak into the peritoneal cavity causing chemical irritation. Grey-Turner (flank ecchymosis) and Cullen (periumbilical ecchymosis) signs in severe haemorrhagic pancreatitis [5]. |
| ***Diverticulitis (uncomplicated)*** | LIF pain/tenderness, low-grade fever, altered bowel habit. ***Severe inflammation of abdominal organ*** causing localised peritoneal irritation without free perforation [1]. |
| ***Appendicitis (uncomplicated)*** | RIF pain, low-grade fever, anorexia. Localised peritonitis in RIF before perforation occurs [1]. |

##### By Mechanism: Ischaemia

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|
| ***Ischaemic bowel (acute mesenteric ischaemia)*** | "Pain out of proportion to examination" in the early stages (visceral pain with minimal signs). Later → bowel infarction → full peritonitis with guarding, rigidity. Risk factors: AF (embolic), atherosclerosis, low-flow states. Markedly elevated lactate and metabolic acidosis. ***Ischaemia of abdominal organ e.g. bowel*** [1]. |
| **Strangulated / incarcerated hernia** | Irreducible, tender lump at hernia site (inguinal, femoral, incisional). Bowel within the hernia becomes ischaemic → gangrene → perforation → peritonitis. Features of intestinal obstruction (vomiting, distension, constipation) may coexist. |

##### By Mechanism: Other

| Condition | Key Differentiating Features |
|---|---|
| ***Anastomotic leakage*** | Post-operative patient (typically day 3–7 after bowel surgery). Sudden deterioration with fever, tachycardia, abdominal pain, peritoneal signs. Peritoneal fluid may be ***faeculent or bile-stained*** [1][3]. |

---

### Layer 2: Conditions That Mimic Peritonitis ("Pseudo-peritonitis")

These are critical because they can present with abdominal pain and even some degree of abdominal tenderness/guarding, but the peritoneum itself is NOT the primary site of pathology. Operating on these patients is either unnecessary or harmful.

#### Retroperitoneal Conditions

Retroperitoneal organs are NOT covered by peritoneum [3], so inflammation of these structures does not directly cause classical peritoneal signs — but the pain may be severe and can be confusing:

| Condition | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|
| **Ruptured AAA** | Sudden severe abdominal/back pain, hypotension, pulsatile abdominal mass. May mimic peritonitis with abdominal tenderness. CT angiography diagnostic. Ecchymosis signs (Grey-Turner, Cullen) overlap with severe pancreatitis [5]. |
| **Acute pancreatitis** | Retroperitoneal organ → signs may be less classical initially. Raised amylase/lipase ( > 3× ULN). Pain radiating to back. No free gas on CXR (distinguishes from PPU). |
| **Perinephric abscess / pyelonephritis** | Flank pain, fever, costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyuria and bacteriuria on urinalysis. CT: perinephric collection. |
| **Ureteric colic** | Severe colicky loin-to-groin pain. Restless patient (writhing, cannot stay still — opposite to peritonitis where patients lie still). Haematuria on dipstick. CT KUB diagnostic. |

#### Gynaecological Conditions (Critical DDx in Women of Reproductive Age)

These are extremely important — several of these present almost identically to appendicitis or pelvic peritonitis:

| Condition | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|
| ***Ruptured ectopic pregnancy*** | **Life-threatening**. Amenorrhoea + positive β-hCG + acute lower abdominal pain + haemodynamic instability. Free fluid on FAST USG. Always do a **pregnancy test** in any woman of reproductive age with acute abdominal pain [2]. |
| ***Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)*** | Bilateral lower abdominal pain, fever, purulent vaginal discharge. Pain worsens during/shortly after menses or with coitus. **Cervical motion tenderness** ("chandelier sign") on bimanual examination [2]. |
| ***Tubo-ovarian abscess*** | Complication of PID. Inflammatory mass in adnexa. High fever, toxic. Can rupture → generalised peritonitis [2]. |
| ***Ruptured ovarian cyst*** | Sudden onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain, often during exercise or intercourse. May cause haemoperitoneum. Diagnosis: USG showing free fluid + collapsed cyst [2]. |
| ***Ovarian / fallopian tube torsion*** | Sudden severe unilateral pelvic pain, nausea/vomiting. Whirlpool sign on Doppler USG. Adnexal mass with absent blood flow [2]. |
| **Endometriosis / Endometrioma** | Cyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia. Endometrioma rupture can cause chemical peritonitis (chocolate-coloured fluid). |

<Callout title="Golden Rule" type="error">
***Always do a pregnancy test (urine or serum β-hCG) in ANY woman of reproductive age presenting with acute abdominal pain.*** A ruptured ectopic pregnancy can kill within hours. This is the single most important "don't miss" diagnosis.
</Callout>

#### Medical Causes ("Non-Surgical Abdomen" Mimicking Peritonitis)

These are conditions where laparotomy is **not** indicated — operating on these patients causes harm:

| Condition | Why It Mimics Peritonitis | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|---|
| **Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)** | Severe abdominal pain (mechanism: gastric dilatation, mesenteric ischaemia from dehydration, metabolic irritation of peritoneum). Can cause guarding and even board-like rigidity. | Hyperglycaemia, ketonaemia, metabolic acidosis with high anion gap. History of type 1 DM or missed insulin. Kussmaul breathing, fruity breath. ABG diagnostic [4]. |
| **Acute MI (especially inferior)** | Inferior MI can refer pain to the epigastrium via diaphragmatic irritation (shared innervation T7–T9). | ECG, troponin. Risk factors for IHD. No peritoneal signs on careful examination. |
| **Addisonian crisis** | Severe abdominal pain, hypotension, vomiting. | Hyperkalaemia, hyponatraemia, hypoglycaemia. History of steroid use/withdrawal. Low random cortisol. |
| **Herpes zoster (shingles)** | Dermatome distribution of pain may precede the rash by days → can mimic peritonitis of the corresponding abdominal quadrant. | Unilateral, dermatomal. Vesicular rash eventually appears. |
| **Acute porphyria** | Severe colicky abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, dark urine. | Urine porphobilinogen elevated. Young woman. |
| ***Hypercalcaemia*** | Abdominal pain, constipation, confusion ("bones, stones, groans, moans"). | Serum calcium elevated. PTH, malignancy workup. |
| **Sickle cell crisis** | Vaso-occlusive crisis can cause severe abdominal pain mimicking an acute abdomen. | Known sickle cell disease. Blood film, Hb electrophoresis. |
| **Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)** | Recurrent episodes of sterile peritonitis with fever, serositis. | Mediterranean ethnicity. Self-limiting episodes. Responds to colchicine. MEFV gene mutation. |

<Callout title="The 'Medical Abdomen' Trap" type="error">
DKA is the classic exam trap. A young patient with Type 1 DM presents with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal rigidity — the surgical team is called for a "peritonitis." But checking a blood glucose and ABG reveals the diagnosis. Always check glucose and ABG in any patient with unexplained peritonitis. ***Fever, leucocytosis, acidosis, sepsis of unexplained cause*** in the elderly [1] could also be a medical abdomen — but equally could be masked surgical pathology, so maintain high suspicion.
</Callout>

#### Abdominal Wall Pathology

| Condition | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|
| **Rectus sheath haematoma** | Localized abdominal wall pain and mass. **Carnett's sign positive** (tenderness increases when patient tenses abdominal wall by lifting head — opposite to intra-abdominal pathology where tenderness decreases with tensing because the tensed muscle "protects" the viscera). History of anticoagulation, trauma, or vigorous coughing. CT diagnostic. |

#### Extra-abdominal Conditions

| Condition | How to Differentiate |
|---|---|
| **Lower lobe pneumonia / basal pleurisy** | Diaphragmatic irritation → referred upper abdominal pain. Cough, dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain. CXR shows consolidation. |
| **Testicular torsion** | Acute scrotal pain may be referred to the lower abdomen. Always examine the scrotum in a young male with lower abdominal pain. |

### Key Clinical Clues to Narrow the Differential

| Clinical Clue | Points Towards |
|---|---|
| **Free gas under diaphragm on erect CXR** | Perforated hollow viscus (PPU, perforated bowel) → **proceed to laparotomy** [3] |
| ***Bile-stained peritoneal fluid*** | Biliary perforation / GB injury [1][3] |
| ***Faeculent peritoneal fluid*** | Perforated colon [1][3] |
| ***↑ Amylase in peritoneal fluid*** | Pancreatitis or perforated duodenum/small bowel [1][3] |
| ***↑ Creatinine in peritoneal fluid*** | Bladder / urinary tract injury [1] |
| **Monomicrobial culture from ascitic fluid** | SBP (primary peritonitis) [1][2] |
| **Polymicrobial culture from ascitic fluid** | Secondary peritonitis (perforation/breach) [1][2] |
| **Lymphocyte-predominant ascitic fluid + high ADA** | TB peritonitis [1] |
| **Turbid PD effluent** in a PD patient | CAPD peritonitis [2] |
| **Positive β-hCG** | Ruptured ectopic pregnancy |
| **Cervical motion tenderness** | PID |
| **High anion gap metabolic acidosis + hyperglycaemia** | DKA (medical mimic) |
| **Pain out of proportion to examination** | Mesenteric ischaemia (early) |
| **Dermatomal pain pattern** | Herpes zoster |

### Special Consideration: Differentiating Diverticulitis from CRC

This is specifically highlighted in the senior notes [2] and worth emphasising:

- ***Similar clinical features and bowel wall thickening on abdominal CT scan*** [2]
- ***Features suggestive of acute diverticulitis*** include: ***presence of pericolonic and mesenteric inflammation, involvement of > 10 cm of colon, and absence of enlarged pericolonic lymph nodes on CT*** [2]
- ***CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation*** [2] — you should NEVER do a colonoscopy during the acute episode (risk of perforation)
- In Asian populations, ***right-sided diverticulitis is significantly more common*** and is ***OFTEN confused with acute appendicitis*** [2]

---

### Special Consideration: DDx of RIF Pain (Appendicitis vs. Everything Else)

Since appendicitis progressing to peritonitis is so common, and RIF pain has a broad differential [2]:

**GI**: Acute appendicitis, ***right-sided diverticulitis (more common in Asians)***, Meckel's diverticulitis, acute ileitis (*Yersinia, Campylobacter, Salmonella*), Crohn's disease, caecal carcinoma, mesenteric adenitis

**O&G**: ***Ruptured ectopic pregnancy, PID, tubo-ovarian abscess, ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian/fallopian tube torsion, endometriosis*** [2]

**Urological**: Ureteric colic, UTI/pyelonephritis

**Other**: Strangulated inguinal/femoral hernia, psoas abscess

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis of Peritonitis">

**Layer 1 — Causes of peritonitis (what's the aetiology?):**
- **Primary**: SBP (cirrhosis), CAPD peritonitis (PD patient), TB peritonitis (insidious, laparoscopic biopsy)
- **Secondary (most common)**: Perforation (PPU, appendix, diverticular, CRC, trauma), Inflammation (cholecystitis, appendicitis, pancreatitis, diverticulitis), Ischaemia (mesenteric ischaemia, strangulated hernia), Anastomotic leak
- **Tertiary**: Persistent despite adequate Rx — opportunistic organisms

**Layer 2 — Mimics of peritonitis:**
- **Medical**: DKA (classic trap!), inferior MI, Addisonian crisis, porphyria, herpes zoster, hypercalcaemia, sickle cell, FMF
- **Retroperitoneal**: Ruptured AAA, pancreatitis, perinephric abscess, ureteric colic
- **Gynaecological** (always pregnancy test!): Ruptured ectopic, PID, TOA, ovarian cyst rupture, torsion
- **Abdominal wall**: Rectus sheath haematoma (Carnett's sign)
- **Extra-abdominal**: Basal pneumonia, testicular torsion

**Key distinguishing clues**: Free gas = perforation → laparotomy. Bile-stained/faeculent fluid = perforated GI tract. Monomicrobial = primary. Polymicrobial = secondary. Lymphocytic + high ADA = TB. Turbid PD effluent = CAPD peritonitis. Positive β-hCG = ectopic. High AG metabolic acidosis = DKA.
