## Complications of Peritonitis

Peritonitis is dangerous not only because of the acute episode itself, but because it triggers a cascade of local and systemic complications that can kill the patient even after the source is controlled. Think of complications in two categories: **systemic** (the whole body is affected) and **local** (problems within the peritoneal cavity). I'll also cover complications specific to each subtype (SBP, CAPD, secondary) and post-operative complications.

---

### A. Systemic Complications

These arise because the inflamed peritoneum (1.7 m² surface area) acts as a massive absorption surface for bacteria and endotoxins, while simultaneously sequestering litres of protein-rich fluid. The result is the simultaneous insults of **hypovolaemia** and **sepsis**.

#### 1. Sepsis and Septic Shock

- **Pathophysiology**: Bacteria and endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative cell walls) are absorbed across the inflamed peritoneum into the systemic circulation → activate the innate immune system → massive release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) → **SIRS** → if uncontrolled, progresses to **sepsis** → **septic shock** (persistent hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, requiring vasopressors)
- ***Septicaemia, endotoxaemia*** leading to ***hypovolaemia & shock*** [1]
- Septic shock involves **distributive shock** (nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation → decreased SVR) superimposed on **hypovolaemic shock** (third-space losses)
- Mortality of septic shock from intra-abdominal source: 30–50%

#### 2. Multi-Organ Failure (MOF)

When the sepsis cascade is not controlled, individual organ systems begin to fail sequentially. This is the terminal pathway of untreated peritonitis:

| Organ System | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Lungs** | **ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)** | Inflammatory cytokines damage pulmonary capillary endothelium → increased permeability → non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema → severe hypoxaemia. Also: abdominal distension pushes diaphragm up → basal atelectasis → further V/Q mismatch. |
| **Kidneys** | **AKI (Acute Kidney Injury)** | Pre-renal AKI from hypovolaemia (third-space losses) + sepsis-induced renal vasoconstriction + direct tubular injury from endotoxins. In SBP specifically, this manifests as **hepatorenal syndrome** (functional renal failure in cirrhosis triggered by SBP). [2] |
| **Liver** | **Septic hepatitis / "shock liver"** | Hypoperfusion + endotoxin-mediated intrahepatic cholestasis. In cirrhotic patients, SBP precipitates hepatic decompensation → worsening **hepatic encephalopathy** [2]. |
| **Coagulation** | **DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation)** | Endotoxins and cytokines activate the coagulation cascade diffusely → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → simultaneous microvascular thrombosis AND uncontrolled bleeding. Prolonged PT/APTT, low fibrinogen, raised D-dimers, low platelets. |
| **Heart** | **Septic cardiomyopathy** | Myocardial depression from circulating cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1) → reduced ejection fraction despite high cardiac output state. |
| **Brain** | **Septic encephalopathy** | ***Altered mental status — development of delirium, confusion and cognitive slowing — caused by infection and hepatic decompensation*** [2]. Cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier, alter neurotransmitter balance (increased GABA, decreased dopamine). |

<Callout title="MOF in Peritonitis — The Cascade">
The typical sequence is: peritonitis → sepsis → lung failure (ARDS, often the first organ to fail) → kidney failure (AKI) → liver dysfunction → coagulopathy (DIC) → cardiovascular collapse → death. Each organ failure increases mortality by ~15–20%. By the time 3 organs have failed, mortality exceeds 70%.

#### 3. Hypovolaemic Shock

- ***Sequestration of large amounts of protein-rich fluid*** into the peritoneal cavity [1]
- Paralytic ileus compounds this by causing further fluid sequestration within distended bowel loops
- If not aggressively resuscitated with IV fluids, the patient develops profound intravascular depletion → end-organ hypoperfusion → metabolic acidosis → cardiac arrest
- Associated electrolyte derangements: hypokalaemia (vomiting, NGT losses), metabolic acidosis (tissue hypoperfusion, lactate accumulation), hypoalbuminaemia (protein leak into peritoneal cavity)

#### 4. Electrolyte and Metabolic Derangements

| Derangement | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Metabolic acidosis** | Tissue hypoperfusion → anaerobic metabolism → lactic acidosis. Also: AKI → impaired acid excretion. |
| **Hypokalaemia** | Vomiting, NGT losses, third-space sequestration. Dangerous: can cause cardiac arrhythmias and worsen paralytic ileus. |
| **Hyponatraemia** | Dilutional (ADH release in response to hypovolaemia) or from GI losses. |
| **Hypoalbuminaemia** | Massive protein leak across inflamed peritoneum. Worsens oedema (reduced oncotic pressure) and impairs drug binding. |
| **Hyperglycaemia** | Stress response → catecholamines and cortisol → insulin resistance. ***Infection will induce hyperglycaemia*** [2]. Particularly relevant in CAPD peritonitis with diabetic patients. |
| **Hypoglycaemia** | ***Nausea and anorexia of peritonitis will lead to malnutrition and hence hypoglycaemia in patients receiving hypoglycaemic agents or insulin*** [2]. A dual risk with hyperglycaemia in diabetics. |

### B. Local (Intra-Abdominal) Complications

#### 1. Intra-Abdominal Abscess

- The most common local complication of peritonitis
- **Pathophysiology**: The body's attempt to wall off infection is both protective and problematic. The omentum ("policeman of the abdomen") and fibrinous adhesions seal off pockets of infection, creating localised collections of pus. While this prevents generalised spread, the abscess itself becomes a **persistent source of sepsis** inaccessible to systemic antibiotics (poor penetration into the abscess cavity).
- **Common sites**: Subphrenic spaces (right and left), Morison's pouch, paracolic gutters, pelvis (pouch of Douglas), interloop collections
- **Clinical features**: Persistent fever (swinging/spiking pattern) despite appropriate antibiotics, persistent abdominal pain, leucocytosis, failure to improve. ***Should be suspected in patients with no improvement in abdominal pain or a persistent fever despite 3 days of antibiotic treatment*** [6]
- In appendicitis: ***Walled off → form appendiceal abscess → obstruction*** [3]. ***Not walled off → generalised peritonitis*** [3]
- **Diagnosis**: CT abdomen with contrast — rim-enhancing fluid collection ± air/debris
- **Management**: ***Percutaneous drainage of abdominal abscess*** [1] (CT-guided or USG-guided) + continued IV antibiotics. Surgical drainage if percutaneous approach fails or is not technically feasible.
- A special variant: ***pyogenic liver abscess*** — may develop ***due to spread of infection through the portal circulation*** [6] (e.g., from diverticulitis or appendicitis via pylephlebitis)

#### 2. Paralytic Ileus

- Already present during peritonitis (reflex sympathetic inhibition + local mediators), but may **persist** after source control
- Prolonged ileus → continued third-space losses, inability to feed, risk of aspiration
- Differentiating prolonged ileus from early adhesive mechanical obstruction post-operatively can be challenging (CT with oral contrast helps)

#### 3. Adhesion Formation

- Fibrinous exudates deposited during peritonitis organise into **fibrous adhesions** between bowel loops, omentum, and parietal peritoneum
- These adhesions are the **most common cause of small bowel obstruction** in the developed world
- Can cause obstruction weeks, months, or years after the original peritonitis episode
- ***Post-operative complications*** of surgery for peritonitis include: ***adhesive intestinal obstruction*** [2]
- Why does peritonitis cause MORE adhesions than a clean operation? Because the massive fibrin deposition overwhelms the normal fibrinolytic capacity of the peritoneal mesothelium

#### 4. Fistula Formation

- Chronic inflammation/abscess adjacent to a hollow viscus can erode through the wall and create an abnormal communication (fistula)
- Particularly relevant in **diverticulitis-related peritonitis** [6]:
  - ***Most commonly involve the bladder (colovesical fistula)*** — presents with ***pneumaturia, faecaluria, recurrent dysuria/UTI*** [3][6]
  - ***Followed by vagina (colovaginal fistula)*** — ***especially in post-hysterectomy patients*** — presents with ***passage of faeces and flatus per vagina*** [6]
  - ***Colocutaneous fistula*** — uncommon, usually easy to identify (faecal discharge from skin) [6]
  - ***Coloenteric fistula*** — uncommon, may be asymptomatic or cause corrosive diarrhoea [6]
- Post-appendicectomy: ***Enterocutaneous fistula — result from an intraperitoneal abscess that fistulises to the skin*** [2]
- Management of fistula [6]: ***control sepsis by antibiotics and drainage → resection of affected segment of colon with primary anastomosis → simple repair of the secondarily involved organ (primary closure of bladder or vagina)***

#### 5. Intestinal Obstruction

Peritonitis can cause obstruction through multiple mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Type | Time Course |
|---|---|---|
| **Paralytic ileus** | Functional (no mechanical block) | Immediate — during and shortly after peritonitis |
| **Adhesions** | Mechanical SBO | Days to years after peritonitis |
| **Inflammatory mass / phlegmon** | Mechanical (external compression) | During acute episode |
| **Stricture formation** | Mechanical (luminal narrowing) | Chronic — ***recurrent attacks result in progressive fibrosis and scarring leading to intestinal strictures*** [6] |

- ***Partial colonic obstruction occurs because of relative luminal narrowing due to pericolonic inflammation or compression from a diverticular abscess*** [6]
- ***Complete colonic obstruction occurs because recurrent attacks of acute diverticulitis result in progressive fibrosis and scarring leading to formation of intestinal strictures*** [6]
- ***LBO due to fibrosis and stricture, SBO due to adhesion to inflamed bowel*** [3]

#### 6. Wound Complications (Post-Operative)

Patients operated on for peritonitis have grossly contaminated surgical fields:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Simple wound infection*** | Bacterial contamination of surgical wound from the infected peritoneal cavity. Incidence 20–40% in contaminated/dirty cases (vs. < 2% in clean surgery). Presents with wound erythema, discharge, dehiscence. [2] |
| **Wound dehiscence (burst abdomen)** | The combination of malnutrition, hypoalbuminaemia, infection, and raised intra-abdominal pressure (ileus, distension) impairs fascial healing → wound breakdown. Risk factors: emergency surgery, obesity, steroids, coughing. |
| **Incisional hernia** | Long-term consequence of impaired wound healing, especially after midline laparotomy for peritonitis. |

### C. Complications Specific to Each Subtype

#### SBP-Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)** | SBP is one of the most common precipitants of HRS in cirrhotics. Infection → splanchnic vasodilation → effective hypovolaemia → renal vasoconstriction → functional renal failure. This is why **IV albumin** is given alongside antibiotics (to prevent HRS). Type 1 HRS has > 50% mortality. |
| **Hepatic encephalopathy** | ***Caused by infection and hepatic decompensation*** [2]. SBP increases ammonia production (bacterial urease activity) and impairs hepatic clearance → worsening encephalopathy. |
| **Variceal haemorrhage** | SBP can precipitate variceal bleeding by increasing portal pressure (splanchnic vasodilation → increased portal flow) and worsening coagulopathy. |
| **Recurrence** | ~70% recurrence rate at 1 year without secondary prophylaxis → this is why ***lifelong fluoroquinolone prophylaxis*** is essential [2]. |
| **Death** | In-hospital mortality of SBP: 20–30%. 1-year mortality after first episode: ~50–70% (reflects the severity of the underlying liver disease). SBP should prompt evaluation for **liver transplantation**. |

#### CAPD Peritonitis-Specific Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Peritoneal membrane fibrosis / PD failure** | ***Chronic exposure to dextrose-containing PD fluid and repeated peritonitis will cause fibrosis of peritoneal membrane leading to PD failure which is the major reason for conversion to long-term haemodialysis*** [2]. Each episode of peritonitis damages the mesothelial layer and promotes submesothelial fibrosis, eventually reducing the membrane's transport capacity. |
| **Catheter-related complications** | Exit-site infections, tunnel infections, catheter malposition, catheter blockage (omental wrapping) [2]. These often precede and precipitate peritonitis episodes. |
| **Technique failure (conversion to HD)** | Refractory or recurrent peritonitis is the **single most common reason** for transferring from PD to haemodialysis. |
| **Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS)** | A rare but devastating complication of long-term PD ± repeated peritonitis. The peritoneum becomes encased in a thick fibrous "cocoon" that encases the bowel → intestinal obstruction. Presents with anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, ascites, bowel obstruction. Diagnosis by CT (peritoneal calcification, bowel tethering). Management: tamoxifen + surgical enterolysis if severe. Mortality: 25–50%. |

#### Secondary Peritonitis-Specific Complications

These depend on the underlying cause but include all the local complications above plus:

| Complication | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Anastomotic leak** | Post-operative leak from bowel anastomosis → re-establishes peritoneal contamination → recurrent/persistent peritonitis. More common when primary anastomosis is performed in contaminated field. ***Primary anastomosis is NOT performed in cases of diffuse peritonitis, free perforation or if the patient is medically unstable*** [2] — precisely to avoid this complication. |
| **Stoma-related complications** | If Hartmann's procedure or defunctioning stoma is created: parastomal hernia, stoma prolapse, skin irritation, high-output stoma with dehydration, psychological impact. Stoma reversal itself carries 10–30% complication rate. |
| ***Pylephlebitis (septic portal vein thrombosis)*** | ***Associated with high fever, chills and rigors and jaundice. Thrombosis and infection within portal venous system. Caused by septicaemia in portal venous system and leads to development of intra-hepatic abscesses*** [2]. A rare but life-threatening complication, particularly of appendicitis and diverticulitis. |
| **Progression to tertiary peritonitis** | If source control is inadequate or the patient is immunosuppressed, secondary peritonitis may evolve into tertiary peritonitis with opportunistic organisms — the worst prognosis (mortality 30–60%). |

#### Diverticulitis-Specific Complications Leading to/From Peritonitis

The progression of diverticulitis complications is well-characterised [6][7]:

***Complicated diverticulitis — perforation*** [7]:
- ***Resuscitation with IVF + antibiotics***
- ***Percutaneous drainage for abscess***
- ***Consider emergency surgery*** if:
  - ***Unresponsive to antibiotics***
  - ***Septic shock (high fever, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria)***
  - ***Generalised peritonitis (Hinchey III & IV)***

The Hinchey classification stages represent progressive complications [7]:

| ***Stage*** | ***Description*** | ***Mortality*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***I*** | ***Confined pericolic or mesenteric abscess*** | 0% |
| ***II*** | ***Abscess confined to pelvis or retroperitoneum*** | 5% |
| ***III*** | ***Generalised purulent peritonitis*** | 25% |
| ***IV*** | ***Generalised faecal peritonitis*** | 50% |

Note how mortality escalates dramatically from stage II to IV — this underscores the importance of early diagnosis and intervention to prevent progression.
