## Differential Diagnosis of Hernia

The differential diagnosis of hernia is fundamentally a question of **anatomical location**. You are not just asking "is this a hernia?" — you are asking "what else could produce a lump or pain in this region?" The approach differs depending on whether the presentation is a **groin lump**, a **scrotal swelling**, or **abdominal pain** where a hernia might be mimicked or missed.

Let's work through this systematically.

---

### 1. Clinical Approach to Differential Diagnosis

The very first question when confronted with any lump in the inguinal or scrotal region is to determine its **anatomical compartment**. This dictates your entire differential:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Lump in the groin/scrotal region"] --> B{"Can you get above it?"}
    B -->|"NO - extends into\ninguinal canal/abdomen"| C["Groin pathology\n(inguinoscrotal)"]
    B -->|"YES - confined\nto scrotum"| D["Scrotal pathology"]
    C --> E{"Location relative\nto pubic tubercle?"}
    E -->|"Above + medial"| F["Inguinal hernia\n(direct/indirect)"]
    E -->|"Below + lateral"| G["Femoral hernia\nor femoral region pathology"]
    E -->|"Variable"| H["Other groin lump\n(LN, lipoma, abscess,\nundescended testis, etc.)"]
    D --> I{"Testis and epididymis\nidentifiable separately?"}
    I -->|"Yes - separate\nfrom testis"| J["Epididymal cyst\nVaricocele\nCord lipoma"]
    I -->|"No - inseparable\nfrom testis"| K{"Transillumination?"}
    K -->|"Positive"| L["Hydrocele"]
    K -->|"Negative"| M{"Tender?"}
    M -->|"Yes"| N["Testicular torsion\nEpididymo-orchitis\nAcute haematocele"]
    M -->|"No"| O["Testicular tumour\nChronic haematocele"]
```

<Callout title="The Golden Question">
***"Can you get above it?"*** — If you **cannot** get above the swelling (i.e., your fingers cannot pass between the swelling and the superficial inguinal ring), the mass is extending from the abdomen/inguinal canal → think **inguinoscrotal hernia** or **communicating hydrocele**. If you **can** get above it, the pathology is **confined to the scrotum** [2][3].

### 2. Differential Diagnosis of a Groin Lump

This is the primary differential when hernia is suspected. The lecture slides categorise groin lumps into ***painful*** and ***painless*** presentations [1]:

#### 2.1 ***Painful Groin Lumps*** [1]

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Hurts |
|---|---|---|
| ***Tender lymph nodes*** | Multiple, discrete, firm, non-reducible, no cough impulse; look for a source of infection in the drainage territory (lower limb, perineum, genitalia); may have overlying erythema | Inflammatory infiltrate stretches the lymph node capsule → nociceptor activation |
| ***Strangulated inguinal hernia*** | Previously reducible groin lump now irreducible; tender, warm, erythematous; features of intestinal obstruction (vomiting, distension, constipation); above and medial to pubic tubercle | Narrow hernia neck → venous congestion → ischaemia of trapped contents → peritoneal irritation |
| ***Strangulated femoral hernia*** | Small, firm, below and lateral to pubic tubercle; ***commonly no cough impulse***; often elderly female; systemic signs of sepsis if gangrenous | Same mechanism as above but through the tight femoral ring — even higher strangulation risk than inguinal hernia |

#### 2.2 ***Painless Groin Lumps*** [1]

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Skin swelling*** (sebaceous cyst, lipoma) | Superficial, moves with skin, no cough impulse, no change with Valsalva; can get above it | Benign proliferation of subcutaneous tissue; no communication with peritoneal cavity |
| ***Non-tender lymph nodes*** | Multiple, discrete, firm, non-reducible, no cough impulse; may be matted (malignancy, TB); search for cause (infection, lymphoma, metastatic disease from lower limb/pelvic/genital malignancy) | Reactive hyperplasia or neoplastic infiltration without acute inflammation |
| ***Inguinal hernia (uncomplicated)*** | Reducible, cough impulse present, above and medial to pubic tubercle; may extend into scrotum (indirect); deep ring occlusion test differentiates direct vs indirect | Abdominal contents pushed through defect by IAP; reducible because no adhesions/tight neck |
| ***Femoral hernia (uncomplicated)*** | Below and lateral to pubic tubercle, small, firm, ***often no cough impulse*** | Contents pushed through femoral ring; tight neck often traps omentum early making it irreducible even when uncomplicated |
| ***Undescended testis (ectopic/cryptorchid)*** | Absent testis in the ipsilateral hemiscrotum; firm, oval, mobile mass in the groin; non-transilluminant; no cough impulse | Testis arrested along its normal descent path or deviated to an ectopic site |
| ***Femoral artery aneurysm*** | ***Expansile*** and pulsatile (expands in all directions synchronous with pulse); below inguinal ligament over the femoral artery; non-reducible | Degenerative weakening of arterial wall → localised dilatation; distinguishable from transmitted pulsation because it is *expansile* |
| ***Saphena varix*** | At the saphenofemoral junction (below and lateral to pubic tubercle); bluish tinge; disappears completely on lying down; fluid thrill on cough (not a true cough impulse); positive Trendelenburg test | Incompetent saphenofemoral valve → dilatation of the terminal great saphenous vein; empties with gravity when supine |

<Callout title="Saphena Varix vs Femoral Hernia" type="error">
Both are below the inguinal ligament. Students often confuse these. Key differentiators: saphena varix has a **bluish colour**, gives a **fluid thrill** on coughing (not an expansile impulse), **disappears completely on lying down**, and the great saphenous vein distribution may show varicosities. A femoral hernia is skin-coloured, may be irreducible even when supine, and does not have a fluid thrill. ***Never attempt to "reduce" a femoral artery aneurysm!***
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Full DDx of Groin Mass — ***L SHAPE*** Mnemonic [2]

| Letter | Differential | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **L** | ***Lymph nodes*** | Reactive, infective, metastatic, lymphoma |
| **S** | ***Saphenous varix*** | Bluish, fluid thrill, disappears on lying down |
| **H** | ***Hernia (inguinal / femoral)*** | Most common cause of groin lump |
| **A** | ***Aneurysm (femoral artery)*** | Expansile, pulsatile |
| **P** | ***Psoas abscess*** | Fluctuant, below inguinal ligament; points in the femoral triangle; associated with spinal TB (Pott's disease) or retroperitoneal infection; patient holds hip in flexion (stretching psoas causes pain) |
| **E** | ***Ectopic / undescended testis*** | Absent ipsilateral testis in scrotum |
| + | ***Lipoma / sebaceous cyst*** | Superficial, moves with skin |
| + | ***Transplanted kidney*** | In renal transplant patients — firm mass in iliac fossa/groin; important to recognise and not mistake for hernia |

---

### 3. Differential Diagnosis of Scrotal Swelling

When the presentation is primarily a scrotal mass, the differential overlaps with hernia (because indirect inguinal hernias can descend into the scrotum). The lecture slides provide a clear division [1]:

#### 3.1 ***Painful Scrotal Lumps*** [1]

| Differential | Key Features | Why It Hurts |
|---|---|---|
| ***Testicular torsion*** | Sudden onset severe pain; high-riding testis with horizontal lie; absent cremasteric reflex; negative Prehn's sign (pain NOT relieved by elevation); bimodal age — perinatal and young teens | Twisting of spermatic cord → occlusion of testicular venous drainage first, then arterial supply → ischaemia → intense nociceptor activation |
| ***Torsion of testicular/epididymal appendage*** | Gradual onset; ***"blue dot sign"*** (ischaemic appendage visible through scrotal skin); cremasteric reflex intact; typically ~11 years old | Ischaemia of the vestigial appendage (hydatid of Morgagni) → localised inflammation |
| ***Epididymo-orchitis*** | Gradual onset; swollen, tender epididymis ± testis; positive Prehn's sign (pain relieved by elevation); may have urethral discharge, dysuria; fever | Ascending infection (STI in young men — Chlamydia/GC; UTI organisms in older men — E. coli) → inflammatory oedema stretches tunica |
| ***Strangulated inguinal hernia*** | ***Cannot get above it***; tender, irreducible groin/scrotal mass; features of intestinal obstruction | Bowel ischaemia within hernia sac → pain radiating to scrotum |
| ***Haematocele / haematoma*** | History of trauma; tender, swollen, non-transilluminant scrotum | Blood within tunica vaginalis → capsular distension |

#### 3.2 ***Painless Scrotal Lumps*** [1]

| Differential | Key Features | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Inguinal hernia (uncomplicated)*** | Cannot get above it; cough impulse; reducible; bowel sounds may be heard | Indirect hernia follows spermatic cord into scrotum |
| ***Hydrocele*** | Cannot separate from testis; can get above it (unless communicating); ***transillumination positive***; fluctuant | Fluid within tunica vaginalis; communicating type = patent processus vaginalis (changes size with crying/position); non-communicating = idiopathic or reactive |
| ***Epididymal cyst / spermatocele*** | Separate from testis; can get above it; ***transillumination positive***; cystic; located at head of epididymis | Cystic dilatation of efferent ductules or epididymal tubules; contains clear fluid or non-viable sperm |
| ***Varicocele*** | Separate from testis; can get above it; ***"bag of worms"*** texture; enlarges on Valsalva; ***90% left-sided***; disappears on lying down | Defective venous drainage → dilated pampiniform plexus; left-sided predominance because left testicular vein drains into left renal vein at 90° (vs. right testicular vein drains directly into IVC at an acute angle) |
| ***Testicular tumour*** | Hard, non-tender, irregular mass inseparable from testis; does NOT transilluminate; heavy sensation | Uncontrolled cellular proliferation (germ cell tumours — seminoma/NSGCT); often in young men 20–40 |

#### 3.3 Summary Comparison Table for Scrotal Lumps [3][4]

| Feature | Inguinoscrotal Hernia | Hydrocele | Varicocele | Epididymal Cyst |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Separable from testis | Yes (beside cord) | No (surrounds testis) | Yes | Yes |
| Can get above it | ***No*** | Yes (non-communicating) / No (communicating) | Yes | Yes |
| Transillumination | Negative (opaque bowel/omentum) | ***Positive*** | Negative | ***Positive*** |
| Character | Reducible, cough impulse | Cystic, fluctuant | ***Bag of worms*** | Cystic |
| Changes with position | Reduces on lying down | Communicating: empties on lying; Non-communicating: unchanged | Disappears on lying | Unchanged |

***Typical history clues from the lecture slides*** [1]:
- ***"Reducible groin mass" → Hernia***
- ***"Painful scrotal swelling" → Epididymo-orchitis / Torsion***
- ***"Painless scrotal enlargement" → Hydrocele / Testicular tumour***
- ***"Fullness / bag of worms" → Varicocele***

### 4. Differential Diagnosis of Abdominal Pain Where Hernia is in the Differential

Hernias (inguinal and femoral) frequently appear in the differential diagnosis of **lower abdominal pain** because a strangulated or obstructed hernia can present as an acute abdomen. The lecture slides emphasise this [5][6]:

#### 4.1 ***Right Lower Quadrant (RLQ) Pain*** [5]

***Inguinal/femoral hernia*** must be considered alongside:
- ***Acute appendicitis*** (the most common surgical emergency)
- ***Caecal diverticulitis***
- ***Ureteric colic***
- ***Ruptured ectopic pregnancy***
- ***Mesenteric adenitis***
- ***Torsion of ovarian cyst***
- ***Ileitis (Crohn's, Yersinia)***
- ***Meckel's diverticulitis***
- ***Caecal ischaemia***
- ***Cancer of caecum***
- ***Testicular pathology (torsion, epididymo-orchitis)***
- ***Perforated peptic ulcer (referred)***
- ***Acute cholecystitis (referred)***

#### 4.2 ***Left Lower Quadrant (LLQ) Pain*** [6]

***Inguinal/femoral hernia*** must also be considered here:
- ***Sigmoid diverticulitis***
- ***Cancer of sigmoid colon***
- ***Torsion of ovarian cyst***
- ***Ruptured ectopic pregnancy***
- ***Ureteric colic***
- ***Testicular pathology***

#### 4.3 ***Diffuse / Non-specific Abdominal Pain*** [5]

In the lecture slide titled ***"Have You Forgotten?"***, hernias are specifically listed as a commonly **overlooked** diagnosis [5]:

> ***"Hernia, inguinal or femoral"*** — Always examine the groin in any patient with abdominal pain, vomiting, or intestinal obstruction. A strangulated femoral hernia in an elderly woman can easily be missed if the groin is not examined.

<Callout title="Never Forget the Groin!" type="error">
***Every patient presenting with intestinal obstruction or acute abdominal pain MUST have their groins examined.*** A strangulated femoral hernia — small, below the inguinal ligament, in an obese elderly female — is one of the most commonly missed surgical emergencies. The slide explicitly warns: ***"Have you forgotten? Hernia, inguinal or femoral"*** [5].
</Callout>

### 5. Differential Diagnosis Specific to Hernia Type

When you have already established that the patient likely has a hernia, the next step is determining **what type** and differentiating between them:

#### 5.1 Inguinal vs Femoral Hernia

| Feature | Inguinal Hernia | Femoral Hernia |
|---|---|---|
| Location relative to pubic tubercle | Above and medial | Below and lateral |
| Location relative to inguinal ligament | Above | Below |
| Cough impulse | Usually present | ***Commonly absent*** |
| Typical patient | Male, any age | ***Elderly female (obese)*** |
| Extends to scrotum | Indirect type: yes | Never |
| Strangulation risk | Indirect > direct | ***Highest of all groin hernias*** |
| Content | Small bowel (MC), omentum | ***Omentum, knuckle of small bowel (Richter's hernia)*** |

#### 5.2 Direct vs Indirect Inguinal Hernia

| Feature | Direct | Indirect |
|---|---|---|
| Relation to inferior epigastric vessels | Medial | Lateral |
| Deep ring occlusion test | ***Not controlled*** | ***Controlled*** |
| Descends into scrotum | Rarely | Yes |
| Bilateral | Common | Less common |
| Age | Older | Younger (congenital) or older (acquired) |
| Strangulation | Less (wide neck) | More (narrow deep ring) |

#### 5.3 Inguinal Hernia vs Communicating Hydrocele (Paediatric) [7]

This is a critical paediatric differential — both arise from a **patent processus vaginalis**:

| Feature | Indirect Inguinal Hernia | Communicating Hydrocele |
|---|---|---|
| Processus vaginalis | Patent (wide enough for bowel) | Patent (narrow — only peritoneal fluid passes) |
| Contents | Bowel / omentum | Peritoneal fluid only |
| Transillumination | Negative (opaque bowel) | ***Positive*** (fluid) |
| Cough impulse | Present | Absent |
| Change with position | Reduces with lying down | ***Gradually empties*** over time when supine; ***enlarges during the day*** |
| Risk of incarceration | Yes | No (no bowel in sac) |
| Testis palpable? | Yes (separate from hernia) | ***Testis not palpable*** (surrounded by fluid) |

<Callout title="Communicating Hydrocele = Potential Hernia">
A communicating hydrocele and an indirect inguinal hernia are on a **spectrum** — both involve a patent processus vaginalis. The difference is only the calibre of the opening. A communicating hydrocele can progress to an indirect hernia if the PV widens. This is why ***communicating hydroceles in children are repaired the same way as hernias (herniotomy — high ligation of the PV)*** [7].
</Callout>

### 6. Comprehensive DDx by Anatomical Region — Master Table [1][2][3][5][6]

The lecture slides provide detailed region-by-region lists [1]:

| Anatomical Region | Possible Pathologies |
|---|---|
| ***Inguinal*** | Inguinal hernia; lymph nodes |
| ***Inguinoscrotal*** | Inguinal hernia (indirect, extending into scrotum); ***encysted hydrocele of the cord***; ***infantile hydrocele***; ***hydrocele of the hernia sac*** |
| ***Femoral*** | Femoral hernia; lymph nodes; ***distended psoas bursa***; ***saphena varix***; ***effusion in the hip joint***; undescended/ectopic testis |
| ***Inguinofemoral*** | Inguinal lymph nodes; ***skin lesions (boils, sebaceous cyst, papillomas, warts)*** |
| ***Scrotal — subcutaneous*** | ***Lymph scrotum (filariasis)*** |
| ***Scrotal — tunica vaginalis*** | ***Hydrocele, pyocele, haematocele, chylocele*** |
| ***Scrotal — spermatic cord*** | ***Varicocele, funiculitis, lymph varix, diffuse lipoma of the cord*** |
| ***Scrotal — testis*** | ***Orchitis (acute/chronic), neoplasms, undescended/ectopic testis*** |
| ***Scrotal — epididymis*** | ***Epididymal cysts, acute/chronic infections*** |
| ***In females*** | ***Round ligament varicosities***; hydrocele of the canal of Nuck |

---

### 7. Paediatric-Specific Differentials [7]

In infants and children presenting with an inguinal/scrotal swelling, the differential is slightly different:

| Differential | Key Features |
|---|---|
| ***Indirect inguinal hernia (patent PV)*** | Intermittent swelling with crying/straining; cannot get above it; ***erythema, pain, irritability, vomiting, cyanosis of mass*** if incarcerated |
| ***Communicating hydrocele*** | Fluctuates in size (larger during day, smaller after rest); transilluminates; emptiable |
| ***Non-communicating hydrocele*** | Does not change size; transilluminates; appears at birth; usually resolves by 12–18 months |
| ***Encysted hydrocele of the cord*** | Discrete, transilluminant lump along spermatic cord; moves downward with traction on testis |
| ***Undescended testis*** | Absent ipsilateral testis in scrotum; palpable mass in inguinal canal |
| ***Retractile testis*** | Testis intermittently in canal due to active cremasteric reflex; can be milked down into scrotum; normal |
| ***Inguinal lymphadenopathy*** | Multiple small nodes; look for source (nappy rash, lower limb infection) |
| ***Intussusception*** | Only relevant when hernia presents with obstruction — important DDx of colicky abdominal pain + vomiting in 6 month–2 year olds |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Approach any groin/scrotal lump** with three questions: (a) Can you get above it? (b) Is it above or below the inguinal ligament/pubic tubercle? (c) Does it transilluminate?
2. ***DDx of groin lump — L SHAPE***: Lymph nodes, Saphena varix, Hernia, Aneurysm, Psoas abscess, Ectopic testis (+ Lipoma, transplanted kidney) [2].
3. ***Painful groin lumps***: tender LN, strangulated inguinal hernia, strangulated femoral hernia [1].
4. ***Painless groin lumps***: skin swelling, non-tender LN, inguinal hernia, femoral hernia, undescended testis, femoral artery aneurysm, saphena varix [1].
5. ***Scrotal painful***: testicular torsion, torsion of appendage, epididymo-orchitis, strangulated hernia, haematocele [1].
6. ***Scrotal painless***: inguinal hernia, hydrocele, epididymal cyst, varicocele, testicular tumour [1].
7. ***Typical histories***: reducible groin mass → hernia; painful scrotal swelling → epididymo-orchitis/torsion; painless scrotal enlargement → hydrocele/tumour; bag of worms → varicocele [1].
8. **Always examine the groin** in acute abdomen / intestinal obstruction — ***"Have you forgotten? Hernia, inguinal or femoral"*** [5].
9. In children, ***communicating hydrocele and indirect inguinal hernia are on a spectrum*** (both = patent PV); repair is the same (herniotomy).
10. ***Saphena varix*** vs femoral hernia: varix has bluish colour, fluid thrill, disappears completely supine. ***Femoral aneurysm*** vs femoral hernia: aneurysm is *expansile* and pulsatile.
