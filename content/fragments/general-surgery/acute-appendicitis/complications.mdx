## Complications of Acute Appendicitis

Complications of acute appendicitis can be divided into two broad categories: **complications of the disease itself** (if untreated or inadequately treated) and **post-operative complications** (following appendicectomy). Understanding both is critical for exam purposes and for informed consent discussions with patients.

The key concept linking all disease complications is the **pathological progression** we covered earlier: obstruction → inflammation → gangrene → perforation → abscess or peritonitis. Every complication is essentially a consequence of where the patient falls on this spectrum and whether the body can contain the infection.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease (Pre-operative / Untreated)

These follow the natural history of appendicitis if left untreated, or if diagnosis is delayed.

#### 1. Perforation

***Perforation of the appendix*** [4] is the most feared complication and the natural endpoint of untreated appendicitis.

- **Pathophysiology**: ***Patients develop inflammation and necrosis of the appendix. Increased risk of perforation once significant inflammation and necrosis occurs, which leads to localised abscess formation or diffuse peritonitis*** [4]. As the appendiceal wall undergoes gangrenous necrosis (recall: the appendiceal artery is an end-artery — once thrombosed, the entire wall dies), the weakened wall gives way, releasing intraluminal contents (pus, bacteria, faecal material) into the peritoneal cavity.
- **Clinical suspicion**: ***Considered in patients when fever > 39.4°C, WBC > 15 × 10⁹/L, and imaging studies reveal fluid collection in RLQ*** [4].
- **Risk factors for perforation**: ***Male gender, extremes of age, DM, immunosuppression, previous abdominal surgery, faecolith obstruction, pelvic appendix*** [4].
- **Time course**: Perforation rarely occurs within the first 12 hours of symptom onset. Risk increases significantly after 36–48 hours of untreated symptoms. In children < 5 years and adults > 65 years, perforation rates can reach 50–70% because of delayed diagnosis.
- **The "relief then crash" phenomenon**: As the appendiceal wall becomes gangrenous, nerve endings within the wall die → pain may temporarily improve. Then perforation occurs → sudden severe generalised abdominal pain, tachycardia, fever, and peritoneal signs. This pattern is a classic clinical trap.

<Callout title="Why Do the Extremes of Age Perforate More?" type="error">
**Children**: Cannot articulate symptoms → delayed diagnosis. Underdeveloped omentum → poor ability to wall off infection. Thinner appendiceal wall → perforates more readily.
**Elderly**: Atypical presentation, blunted inflammatory response (less fever, less leucocytosis, less pain) → delayed diagnosis. Often attributed to other causes (constipation, diverticulitis, urinary problems).
</Callout>

#### 2. Appendiceal Abscess

***Walled off: forms appendiceal abscess → may cause obstruction*** [3].

- **Pathophysiology**: When the appendix perforates, the **greater omentum** (the "policeman of the abdomen") and adjacent loops of bowel migrate towards the inflamed area and wall off the contamination, forming a contained collection of pus — an **appendiceal abscess**. This is the body's defence mechanism to prevent generalised peritonitis.
- **Clinical features**: ***Signs of complications: high fever, RLQ mass, imaging shows abscess/phlegmon (inflammatory mass)*** [3]. Classically presents with:
  - Persistent or **swinging (spiking) fever** despite initial treatment
  - Palpable, tender **RLQ mass**
  - Persistent RLQ pain
  - Elevated and rising inflammatory markers (WCC, CRP)
- **Imaging**: CT abdomen with contrast is the gold standard — shows a **rim-enhancing fluid collection** with surrounding fat stranding.
- **Complications of the abscess itself**:
  - May cause **adhesive small bowel obstruction** (loops of bowel become adherent to the inflammatory mass)
  - May fistulise to adjacent structures (see enterocutaneous fistula below)
  - May rupture, causing secondary generalised peritonitis
- **Management**: ***IV antibiotics ± image-guided percutaneous drainage → interval appendicectomy at 6–8 weeks*** [3].

#### 3. Appendiceal Phlegmon

- A **phlegmon** is an inflammatory mass composed of the inflamed appendix, adherent omentum, and loops of bowel — without a drainable fluid collection (distinguishing it from an abscess).
- It represents an earlier/milder stage of the same walling-off process.
- On CT, it appears as an ill-defined **soft tissue mass** with fat stranding in the RIF, but without a discrete fluid pocket.
- Management is the same as abscess: ***IV antibiotics → interval appendicectomy*** [3][4]. Importantly, ***immediate surgery in patients with phlegmon formation is associated with increased morbidity due to dense adhesions and inflammation*** — operating through a phlegmon often ***requires extensive dissection and leads to injury of adjacent structures and complications necessitating ileocolectomy or caecostomy*** [4].

#### 4. Generalised (Diffuse) Peritonitis

***Not walled off: generalised peritonitis*** [3].

- **Pathophysiology**: When the omentum and adjacent structures **fail to wall off** the perforation, faecal and purulent material spreads freely throughout the peritoneal cavity. This is **secondary bacterial peritonitis** — a ***surgical emergency*** [9]. ***Acute secondary bacterial peritonitis*** can be caused by ***severe inflammation of abdominal organs (e.g., diverticulitis, cholecystitis, appendicitis), perforations of the GI tract, anastomotic leakage, or ischaemia of abdominal organs*** [9].
- **Why does it fail to wall off?** In children (underdeveloped omentum), in immunosuppressed patients (blunted inflammatory response cannot organise a wall), or when the contamination is overwhelming (massive perforation with faecal spillage).
- **Clinical features**:
  - **Severe, generalised abdominal pain** — the patient lies absolutely still
  - **Board-like rigidity** — involuntary contraction of the entire abdominal wall musculature (a reflex arc: inflamed peritoneum → somatic afferent nerves → spinal cord → motor efferents → abdominal wall muscles)
  - **Absent bowel sounds** — the bowel enters a state of **paralytic ileus** in response to the generalised peritoneal inflammation (the enteric nervous system "shuts down" when the peritoneum is inflamed)
  - **Sepsis / septic shock** — tachycardia, hypotension, fever (or hypothermia in severe sepsis), altered mental status
  - **Rebound tenderness and guarding** (generalised, not localised)
- **Grading**: This corresponds to **Grade 5** in the disease severity score (perforated with diffuse peritonitis) [4].
- **Management**: This is a **surgical emergency** — requires **open appendicectomy** (or laparoscopic if expertise available), thorough **peritoneal lavage**, and prolonged post-operative IV antibiotics (3–7 days minimum). Haemodynamic resuscitation takes priority.

<Callout title="Peritonitis Classification Refresher">
- **Primary peritonitis**: Infection of ascitic fluid WITHOUT a surgically treatable intra-abdominal source (e.g., SBP in cirrhosis, CAPD-associated, TB peritonitis) [9]
- **Secondary peritonitis**: Infection WITH a surgically treatable source — this includes appendicitis, PPU, perforated diverticulitis, ischaemic bowel [9]
- **Tertiary peritonitis**: Persistent peritonitis after adequate initial therapy (e.g., anastomotic leak, opportunistic infections in ICU patients) [9]

Perforated appendicitis causes **secondary bacterial peritonitis** — preceded by chemical irritation from intestinal contents, then bacterial colonisation.
</Callout>

#### 5. Pylephlebitis (Septic Portal Vein Thrombosis)

***Pylephlebitis (septic portal vein thrombosis)*** [4] — a rare but devastating pre- or post-operative complication.

- **Etymology**: "pyle" (Greek) = gate (referring to the porta hepatis / portal vein); "phlebitis" = vein inflammation.
- **Pathophysiology**: ***Thrombosis and infection within the portal venous system. Caused by septicaemia in the portal venous system*** [4]. The appendiceal vein drains via the ileocolic vein → superior mesenteric vein → portal vein. When the appendix is severely infected or perforated, bacteria enter this venous system, causing septic thrombophlebitis that propagates along the portal vein to the liver, leading to ***development of intra-hepatic abscesses*** [4].
- **Clinical features**: ***Associated with high fever, chills and rigors, and jaundice*** [4]. The patient is severely septic. Jaundice occurs because: (1) hepatic abscesses disrupt bile canaliculi, and (2) portal vein thrombosis causes hepatic congestion and impaired bilirubin metabolism.
- **Diagnosis**: CT abdomen with IV contrast — shows filling defect in the portal vein (thrombus) and ring-enhancing hepatic abscesses. Blood cultures are typically positive.
- **Management**: Prolonged IV antibiotics (4–6 weeks), therapeutic anticoagulation (to prevent thrombus propagation), ± percutaneous drainage of hepatic abscesses. Mortality is significant (~10–30%).

> **Connection to liver abscess**: Pylephlebitis from appendicitis is a recognised cause of **pyogenic liver abscess** — ***spread from portal vein (20% of liver abscess causes): intra-abdominal infections e.g., acute appendicitis, diverticulitis, Crohn's*** [10].

### B. Post-operative Complications (Following Appendicectomy)

These are systematically categorised by timing. ***Risks — need to know for consent!*** [3]

#### Immediate Complications (Intra-operative / < 1 hour)

| Complication | Pathophysiology / Explanation | Management |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| ***Conversion to open*** [3] | Inability to complete laparoscopically — due to dense adhesions (complicated appendicitis), uncontrollable bleeding, unclear anatomy, or inability to safely identify structures | Continue via open approach. This should always be discussed during pre-operative consent |
| ***Normal appendix found*** [3] | A normal appendix is found at operation (negative appendicectomy rate is ~10–15%). ***Still removed to avoid diagnostic confusion*** [3] — if left in situ, any future RLQ pain episode would re-raise appendicitis | Appendix is removed. Thorough inspection of remainder of abdomen: terminal ileum (Crohn's, Meckel's, TB), mesenteric lymph nodes (adenitis), caecum (diverticulitis, carcinoma), gynaecological organs (women) |
| ***Malignancy found requiring right hemicolectomy ± stoma*** [3] | Incidental finding of carcinoid tumour ( > 2 cm), adenocarcinoma, or mucinous neoplasm. ***Appendix specimen sent to pathology for assessment of neoplasms (1% chance)*** [3] | Carcinoid ≤ 2 cm: appendicectomy alone is curative. Carcinoid > 2 cm or involving caecum/lymph nodes: ***right hemicolectomy*** [3]. Adenocarcinoma: ***right hemicolectomy ± adjuvant chemotherapy*** [3]. Mucinous tumours: risk assessment for pseudomyxoma peritonei [3] |
| ***Injury to surrounding organs*** [3] | Caecum, small bowel, ureter, iliac vessels — from dissection, diathermy, or port insertion | Immediate recognition and repair. Bowel injury may require primary repair or resection. Ureteric injury requires urological consultation |
| ***Bleeding*** [3] | From appendicular artery (end-artery), mesoappendix, port-site vessels | Ensure mesoappendix is adequately ligated/clipped. Intra-operative haemostasis; if uncontrollable, convert to open |

#### Early Complications (24 hours to weeks)

| Complication | Pathophysiology / Explanation | Clinical Features | Management |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| ***Wound infection (5–10%)*** [3] | The most common post-operative complication. Polymicrobial organisms (same as appendicitis: *E. coli*, *Bacteroides*). Risk increases with complicated appendicitis, contamination during surgery, obesity, diabetes | Wound erythema, warmth, discharge (purulent), pain, dehiscence. Typically day 3–7 post-op | Wound opening and drainage, swab for culture, wound packing, antibiotics if cellulitis/systemic signs |
| ***Intra-abdominal / pelvic abscess*** [3][4] | Residual infected material collects in dependent areas (pelvis, RIF, subphrenic space) after surgery. More common with complicated appendicitis. ***Higher rate of intra-abdominal abscess*** reported with laparoscopic approach in some studies [4] | ***Spiking fever*** [3] (swinging high spikes → near-normal troughs — the classic pattern of an undrained abscess). Persistent abdominal pain, ↑ WCC/CRP, tachycardia. May cause secondary ileus | CT abdomen to localise. **Image-guided percutaneous drainage** is first-line. IV antibiotics. Surgery if not amenable to percutaneous drainage |
| ***Post-operative ileus*** [3][4] | Temporary failure of bowel peristalsis after abdominal surgery. The peritoneal inflammation and surgical manipulation cause the enteric nervous system to enter a transient "shutdown" state. Exacerbated by opioid analgesia, electrolyte imbalance (especially hypokalaemia), and intra-abdominal sepsis | Abdominal distension, nausea/vomiting, absent flatus and bowel sounds. Typically resolves within 2–5 days | Conservative: NPO, IV fluids, NG tube for decompression if needed, correct electrolytes (especially K⁺), minimise opioids, early mobilisation. Resolves spontaneously in most cases |

<Callout title="Spiking Fever Post-Appendicectomy = Think Abscess">
The classic post-operative fever pattern to recognise: **Day 5–7 post-appendicectomy, the patient develops swinging fevers** (temperature spikes to 39–40°C then drops to near-normal, recurring daily). This "picket-fence" fever pattern is highly suggestive of an **undrained intra-abdominal or pelvic abscess**. The mechanism: the abscess periodically releases bacteria/pyrogens into the bloodstream (transient bacteraemia), causing a fever spike, which then resolves as the immune system temporarily contains it — only for it to happen again. The definitive treatment is **drainage**, not just more antibiotics.
</Callout>

#### Late Complications (Weeks to months/years)

| Complication | Pathophysiology / Explanation | Clinical Features | Management |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| ***Incisional hernia*** [3] | Herniation of bowel/omentum through a defect in the fascial closure at the incision/port site. More common with open surgery (larger fascial defect), obesity, wound infection, malnutrition, steroid use | Reducible lump at the scar site, worse with coughing/straining | Surgical repair (mesh repair) if symptomatic or at risk of incarceration |
| ***Adhesions*** [3] | Fibrous bands form between intra-abdominal structures as part of peritoneal wound healing. Exaggerated in complicated appendicitis with peritoneal contamination. Adhesions are the **most common cause of small bowel obstruction** in developed countries | May be asymptomatic for years. Can present as adhesive small bowel obstruction (colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, distension, absolute constipation) at any point in the future | Conservative initially (NG decompression, IV fluids, nil by mouth) → surgery (adhesiolysis) if no resolution or signs of strangulation |
| ***Recurrent / stump appendicitis*** [3] | If the appendiceal stump is left too long ( > 0.5 cm), residual appendiceal tissue can re-inflame. The retained stump essentially behaves like a miniature appendix and can undergo the same obstructive pathophysiology as the original appendix | Recurrence of RLQ pain, fever, leucocytosis — identical presentation to the original appendicitis. History of prior appendicectomy. CT shows inflamed stump | Completion appendicectomy (removal of the stump) |
| ***Enterocutaneous fistula*** [4] | ***Results from an intra-peritoneal abscess that fistulises to the skin*** [4]. An undrained or inadequately drained abscess erodes into an adjacent bowel loop (forming an enteric communication) and then tracks through the abdominal wall to the skin surface | Faeculent discharge from the wound or drain site. May be associated with sepsis, malnutrition, electrolyte derangement (loss of intestinal contents through the fistula) | Conservative first: NPO, TPN (total parenteral nutrition), octreotide (reduces intestinal secretions by inhibiting GI hormones), wound care, antibiotics for sepsis. Many close spontaneously. Surgery if persistent ( > 6 weeks) or high-output |

#### Incidental Appendiceal Neoplasms — A Special "Complication" to Know

***Appendix specimen sent to pathology for assessment of neoplasms (1% chance)*** [3].

The resected appendix must **always** be sent for histological examination. In approximately 1% of cases, an unsuspected neoplasm is found:

| Neoplasm | Frequency | Management |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| ***Carcinoid tumour*** | Most common appendiceal neoplasm (~0.3–0.7% of appendicectomy specimens) | ***≤ 2 cm: appendicectomy alone is curative. > 2 cm or involving caecum/lymph nodes: right hemicolectomy ± stoma*** [3] |
| ***Adenocarcinoma*** | Rare. ***Highly malignant*** | ***Right hemicolectomy ± adjuvant chemotherapy*** [3] |
| ***Mucinous neoplasms*** | Mucinous cystadenoma / cystadenocarcinoma | ***Mucinous tumours have risk of perforation and seeding → pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP). Low risk: colonoscopy + surveillance. High risk: cytoreductive surgery + heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC)*** [3] |

<Callout title="Pseudomyxoma Peritonei — A Rare but High-Yield Concept" type="idea">
PMP ("pseudo" = false; "myxoma" = mucous tumour; "peritonei" = of the peritoneum) is a condition where the peritoneal cavity fills with mucinous (jelly-like) material, usually from a ruptured mucinous appendiceal tumour. The mucinous cells implant on peritoneal surfaces and continue secreting mucin, causing progressive abdominal distension ("jelly belly"). Treatment is aggressive: **cytoreductive surgery** (removing all visible tumour from every peritoneal surface) + **HIPEC** (heated chemotherapy solution bathed directly in the peritoneal cavity during surgery to kill residual microscopic tumour cells). This is why mucinous appendiceal tumours, even when "benign-appearing," must be taken seriously.

### Mortality

- **Non-perforated appendicitis**: Mortality < 0.1% — extremely low with modern surgical care.
- **Perforated appendicitis**: Mortality 0.5–5%, rising significantly in the elderly and immunocompromised.
- **Generalised peritonitis with septic shock**: Mortality can exceed 10–30% depending on patient comorbidities and time to intervention.
- The key determinant of outcome is **time to diagnosis and treatment** — every hour of delay increases the risk of progression along the complication spectrum.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Disease Complications** (natural history if untreated):

- **Perforation**: Suspect when fever > 39.4°C, WBC > 15 × 10⁹/L, RLQ fluid collection on imaging. Risk factors: male, extremes of age, DM, immunosuppression, faecolith, pelvic appendix.
- **Appendiceal abscess/phlegmon**: Walled-off perforation. Presents with persistent fever, RLQ mass, elevated inflammatory markers. Manage with IV antibiotics ± percutaneous drainage → interval appendicectomy at 6–8 weeks. Do NOT operate immediately through a phlegmon (risk of ileocolectomy/caecostomy).
- **Generalised peritonitis**: Perforation NOT walled off. Board-like rigidity, absent bowel sounds, septic shock. Surgical emergency — open appendicectomy + peritoneal lavage.
- **Pylephlebitis**: Septic portal vein thrombosis → hepatic abscesses. High fever, rigors, jaundice. CT shows portal vein thrombus + liver abscesses. Prolonged IV antibiotics + anticoagulation.

**Post-operative Complications** (consent risks):

- **Immediate**: Conversion to open, normal appendix still removed, incidental malignancy needing R hemicolectomy ± stoma, organ injury, bleeding.
- **Early**: Wound infection (5–10%, most common), intra-abdominal/pelvic abscess (spiking fever — drain it), post-op ileus.
- **Late**: Incisional hernia, adhesions (most common cause of SBO), stump appendicitis, enterocutaneous fistula, pylephlebitis.

**Incidental Neoplasms** (1% of specimens): Carcinoid (≤ 2 cm = appendicectomy sufficient; > 2 cm = R hemicolectomy), adenocarcinoma (R hemicolectomy + chemo), mucinous tumours (risk of pseudomyxoma peritonei → cytoreductive surgery + HIPEC if high risk).
