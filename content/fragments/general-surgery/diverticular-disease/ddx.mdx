## Differential Diagnosis of Diverticular Disease

The differential diagnosis of diverticular disease depends entirely on **which presentation** you're dealing with. An elderly man with painless massive PR bleeding has a completely different DDx list from a middle-aged woman with LLQ pain and fever. So let's break this down by clinical scenario — the way you'd actually think on a ward round.

---

### Approach to the Differential Diagnosis

The key principle: **diverticular disease is a mimic**. It can look like cancer, appendicitis, IBD, or ischaemic colitis depending on the presentation. Your job is to systematically exclude dangerous diagnoses (especially ***colorectal cancer***) before settling on diverticular disease as the answer.

### A. Differential Diagnosis of Acute Diverticulitis

This is the scenario of **lower abdominal pain + fever + leucocytosis** — the classic triad [3][4]. The DDx here is essentially "what else causes localised lower abdominal pain with inflammation?"

#### 1. ***Colorectal Cancer (CRC)*** — The Most Important DDx [3]

- **Why it's confusable**: CRC and diverticulitis share remarkably similar features:
  - Both cause **bowel wall thickening** on CT
  - Both can present with change in bowel habit, abdominal pain, and even obstruction
  - Both are diseases of the same age group (> 50 years)
- **How to distinguish on CT**:
  - Diverticulitis: pericolonic and mesenteric fat stranding/inflammation, involvement of **> 10 cm** of colon, **absence of enlarged pericolonic lymph nodes**, visible diverticula in surrounding segments [3]
  - CRC: shorter segment of wall thickening (typically < 10 cm), "shouldering" sign (abrupt transition), pericolonic lymphadenopathy, luminal irregularity/mass
- **Critical point**: ***CRC can only be excluded with colonoscopy after resolution of acute inflammation*** — standard practice is **colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks** post-recovery [3][5]

> ***"Rule out malignancy" — colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks after acute diverticulitis is mandatory*** [5]

<Callout title="CRC vs Diverticulitis — The Exam Trap" type="error">
Never diagnose "diverticulitis" and leave it at that. Up to 1–2% of patients diagnosed with acute diverticulitis on CT are subsequently found to have CRC on follow-up colonoscopy. The two conditions can even coexist. **Always follow up with colonoscopy.**
</Callout>

#### 2. ***Acute Appendicitis*** [2][3][4]

- **Why it's confusable**: Both cause RLQ pain + fever + leucocytosis. This is especially problematic in **Asian populations where right-sided (caecal) diverticulitis** is common [1][4]
- **How to distinguish**:
  - Appendicitis: pain classically starts **periumbilical** (visceral afferent T10) then **migrates to RLQ** (somatic, parietal peritoneum) over 12–24 hours; anorexia is prominent; younger age group (MC 5–12 years) [4]
  - Right-sided diverticulitis: pain is **localised to RLQ from the outset** (no migration); older age group; CT shows colonic wall thickening with diverticula, NOT a distended appendix
  - ***CT scan is the key investigation*** to differentiate — it shows either a dilated inflamed appendix (appendicitis) or colonic wall thickening with pericolic fat stranding around a diverticulum (diverticulitis) [1][3]

> ***Caecal diverticulitis mimicking appendicitis — Role of CT scan*** [1]

#### 3. ***Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)*** [3]

- **Why it's confusable**: IBD (especially Crohn's disease) can cause lower abdominal pain, fever, and even fistulae/strictures — complications shared with diverticular disease
- **How to distinguish**:
  - IBD: ***diarrhoea rather than abdominal pain is the predominant symptom*** [3]; younger age of onset; extraintestinal manifestations (arthritis, uveitis, skin lesions); chronic relapsing course; Crohn's may show skip lesions, non-caseating granulomas; UC shows continuous mucosal inflammation from rectum proximally
  - Diverticulitis: abdominal pain is the predominant symptom; fever and localised peritonism; CT shows pericolic fat stranding with diverticula
  - **Colonoscopy** (after acute phase resolves) is definitive for distinguishing

#### 4. **Infectious Colitis** [3]

- **Why it's confusable**: Infectious colitis (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, *Yersinia*, *E. coli* O157:H7, *C. difficile*) causes abdominal pain, fever, leucocytosis
- **How to distinguish**:
  - Infectious colitis: ***diarrhoea (often bloody) rather than abdominal pain is the predominant symptom*** [3]; acute onset; exposure history (travel, contaminated food, recent antibiotics for *C. difficile*); stool culture/PCR positive
  - Diverticulitis: pain predominates; diarrhoea is not the main feature; CT shows diverticula with pericolic changes

#### 5. **Ischaemic Colitis** [3]

- **Why it's confusable**: Both occur in elderly patients with vascular risk factors; both cause lower abdominal pain
- **How to distinguish**:
  - Ischaemic colitis: ***rapid onset of abdominal pain with haematochezia or bloody diarrhoea*** [3]; risk factors include advanced age, hypertension, DM, dehydration, AF, recent vascular surgery, laxative use, haemodialysis; "watershed" areas affected (splenic flexure, rectosigmoid junction)
  - Diverticulitis: gradual onset of constant pain over days; fever and leucocytosis more prominent; bloody stools uncommon in uncomplicated diverticulitis
  - CT: ischaemia shows segmental wall thickening with "thumbprinting" in a vascular distribution, ± pneumatosis; diverticulitis shows diverticula + fat stranding

#### 6. ***Gynaecological Disorders*** [3]

These are especially important in **women of reproductive age** presenting with lower abdominal/pelvic pain:

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA)** | History of PID; bilateral adnexal tenderness; cervical motion tenderness; purulent vaginal discharge; USS/CT shows complex adnexal mass |
| **Ovarian torsion** | Sudden onset severe unilateral pain; nausea/vomiting; Doppler USS shows absent/reduced ovarian blood flow |
| ***Ectopic pregnancy*** | **Positive pregnancy test** (β-hCG); amenorrhoea; vaginal bleeding; USS shows no intrauterine pregnancy ± adnexal mass/free fluid [3] |
| **Ruptured ovarian cyst** | Sudden onset pain, often during exercise/intercourse; USS shows free pelvic fluid ± collapsed cyst |
| ***PID*** | Recent onset pain worsening with coitus or menses; cervical motion tenderness; purulent endocervical discharge [2] |

<Callout title="Golden Rule in Women of Reproductive Age" type="error">
**Always do a pregnancy test (urine/serum β-hCG)** in any woman of reproductive age presenting with lower abdominal pain. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening emergency that must be excluded before anything else.
</Callout>

#### 7. **Urological Disorders** [3]

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Cystitis / UTI** | Dysuria, frequency, urgency; positive urine dipstick (nitrites, leucocyte esterase); urine culture positive. Note: diverticulitis can cause **sterile pyuria** from adjacent inflammation — don't be fooled [3] |
| **Nephrolithiasis / ureteric colic** | Severe colicky flank-to-groin pain; haematuria (micro or macro); restlessness (patient cannot lie still, unlike peritonitis where patient lies very still); CT KUB shows calculus |

#### 8. ***Meckel's Diverticulitis*** [2]

- ***Similar presentation as acute appendicitis*** [2]
- Congenital remnant of omphalomesenteric duct located on small bowel, **2 feet from ileocaecal valve** [3]
- Small bowel may migrate into RLQ and mimic appendicitis
- ***Diagnosis by CT scan*** [2]
- ***Incidental finding during appendicectomy*** [2]
- ***Treatment: antibiotics; diverticulectomy / small bowel resection*** [2]

### B. Differential Diagnosis of Diverticular Bleeding

This is the scenario of ***painless massive PR bleeding***. The DDx here is "what else causes significant lower GI haemorrhage?"

From the lecture slides, the ***DDx of diverticular bleeding*** includes [5]:

- ***Angiodysplasia***
- ***Severe colitis***
- ***Rectal ulcer***
- ***Small bowel bleeding***
- ***UGIB***

Let's expand on each:

| DDx | Key Features | How to Distinguish from Diverticular Bleeding |
|---|---|---|
| ***Angiodysplasia*** (most common cause of LGIB in age > 65) | Abnormal dilated submucosal AVM; painless haematochezia; **venous** bleeding (tends to be less massive than diverticular bleeding); mostly right-sided (caecum, ascending colon) [6] | Colonoscopy: **cherry red spots**; angiography: **"mother-in-law phenomenon"** (early filling, delayed emptying); often occult/chronic causing iron deficiency anaemia rather than massive acute bleed [6] |
| **Haemorrhoids** (most common in age < 50) | Fresh **outlet-type** blood (on toilet paper, dripping into bowl, separate from stool); painless unless thrombosed; perianal mass on examination | Blood is bright red, small volume, and clearly outlet-type — not mixed with stool. Digital rectal exam and proctoscopy diagnostic |
| ***Severe colitis*** (infectious/IBD/ischaemic) | Bloody diarrhoea with associated symptoms (fever, tenesmus, cramping pain); mucus in stool | Pain and diarrhoea are prominent — diverticular bleeding is painless. Stool cultures, colonoscopy distinguish |
| ***Rectal ulcer*** (solitary rectal ulcer syndrome) | Outlet-type bleeding, mucus discharge, tenesmus, sensation of incomplete evacuation | History of straining; rigid sigmoidoscopy shows ulcer on anterior rectal wall 5–10 cm from anal verge |
| ***Small bowel bleeding*** | Obscure GI bleeding; may present as haematochezia if brisk; Meckel's diverticulum (especially in young), small bowel tumour, Crohn's | If colonoscopy and OGD negative → capsule endoscopy or CT enterography. Meckel's scan (Tc-99m pertechnetate) for ectopic gastric mucosa |
| ***UGIB*** (must not forget!) | Massive upper GI bleed can present as haematochezia (blood acts as cathartic and transits quickly); look for haemodynamic instability out of proportion to apparent blood loss | **Always consider UGIB** if haemodynamically unstable with PR bleed. NG tube aspirate may show blood/coffee-grounds. OGD is indicated |
| ***Colorectal cancer*** | Less commonly presents with massive acute bleed; more often chronic occult blood loss → iron deficiency anaemia; change in bowel habit, weight loss | Colonoscopy (after stabilisation) for definitive diagnosis |

<Callout title="Don't Forget UGIB!" type="error">
About **10-15% of patients presenting with apparent lower GI bleeding (haematochezia) actually have an upper GI source**. A massive peptic ulcer bleed, for instance, can transit so rapidly that blood arrives at the rectum still bright red. If the patient is haemodynamically unstable with PR bleeding, **always consider OGD** before assuming a lower GI source.
</Callout>

### C. Differential Diagnosis of SUDD

SUDD presents with **colicky lower abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, bloating** — essentially overlapping with functional bowel disorders:

| DDx | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)** | Rome IV criteria: recurrent abdominal pain ≥ 1 day/week for 3 months, related to defaecation, with change in stool frequency/form; **no structural abnormality**; diagnosis of exclusion. SUDD is distinguished by the **presence of diverticula on imaging** and often a prior history of diverticulitis [3] |
| **Colorectal cancer** | Constitutional symptoms (weight loss, anorexia); change in stool calibre; iron deficiency anaemia; family history; colonoscopy is definitive |
| **IBD (mild)** | Chronic diarrhoea predominant; extraintestinal features; elevated faecal calprotectin; colonoscopy with biopsy diagnostic |
| **Lactose intolerance** | Symptoms temporally related to dairy ingestion; bloating and diarrhoea; hydrogen breath test diagnostic |
| **Coeliac disease** | Chronic diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, iron/folate deficiency; positive anti-tTG/EMA antibodies; duodenal biopsy shows villous atrophy |

---

### D. Differential Diagnosis of Complicated Diverticulitis (Perforation / Peritonitis)

When diverticular disease presents as an **acute abdomen with generalised peritonitis**, the DDx is the surgical emergency list [4]:

| DDx | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| **Perforated peptic ulcer (PPU)** | Sudden-onset epigastric pain → generalises; history of NSAID use/peptic ulcer disease; erect CXR shows pneumoperitoneum; ***Valentino's sign*** — gastric contents tracking down the right paracolic gutter causing RLQ pain mimicking appendicitis [4] |
| **Perforated appendicitis** | RLQ pain preceding generalised peritonitis; younger age group; CT shows perforated appendix |
| **Ischaemic / infarcted bowel** | Acute severe abdominal pain out of proportion to examination findings (early); AF or vascular risk factors; raised lactate; CT angiography shows mesenteric vessel occlusion |
| **Sigmoid volvulus** | Elderly, institutionalised patient; massive abdominal distension; "coffee bean" sign on AXR; CT shows "whirl sign" [6] |
| **Strangulated hernia** | Irreducible tender groin/incisional swelling; signs of obstruction and/or peritonitis |
| **Perforated colorectal cancer** | May be indistinguishable from perforated diverticulitis on initial CT; histology of resected specimen gives definitive answer |

---

### E. Differential Diagnosis by Location — The RLQ Problem (Hong Kong Relevance)

This is particularly high-yield for Hong Kong exams given the higher prevalence of right-sided diverticular disease [1][2][4]:

***The RLQ DDx*** (from lecture slides) [2][4]:

| Category | Conditions |
|---|---|
| **Caecum/Right colon** | ***Caecal diverticulitis***, acute appendicitis, caecal/appendiceal tumour (lymphoma, carcinoid) |
| **Terminal ileum** | Crohn's disease, ***Meckel's diverticulitis***, intestinal TB, Yersinia ileitis |
| **Urological** | Ureteric colic, testicular torsion, UTI |
| **Gynaecological** | Ovulation pain ("Mittelschmerz"), ovarian cyst complications (rupture/torsion), PID, ruptured ectopic pregnancy |
| **Other** | Mesenteric adenitis (in children), strangulated inguinal/femoral hernia, ***PPU with Valentino's sign*** |

> ***CT abdomen with IV contrast is the diagnostic test of choice*** when differentiating these RLQ causes — it is the single most important investigation [1][2][5]

---

### Summary Table: DDx at a Glance

| Presentation of Diverticular Disease | Top DDx to Exclude | Key Investigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Acute diverticulitis (LLQ/RLQ pain, fever, leucocytosis)** | CRC, appendicitis, IBD, ischaemic colitis, gynaecological causes | CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast → colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks |
| **Diverticular bleeding (painless massive PR bleed)** | Angiodysplasia, CRC, haemorrhoids, colitis, UGIB | Colonoscopy → angiography if inconclusive |
| **SUDD (colicky pain, CIBH)** | IBS, CRC, IBD, lactose intolerance | Colonoscopy to exclude organic pathology |
| **Complicated diverticulitis (acute abdomen)** | PPU, perforated appendix, ischaemic bowel, volvulus | CT abdomen/pelvis; erect CXR (pneumoperitoneum) |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**The single most important DDx across all presentations is colorectal cancer (CRC)** — always exclude it. Colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks post-acute diverticulitis is mandatory.

**Right-sided diverticulitis mimics acute appendicitis** — CT abdomen is the key differentiator, especially in Asian populations including Hong Kong.

**Diverticular bleeding DDx**: angiodysplasia, severe colitis, rectal ulcer, small bowel bleeding, UGIB. Don't forget massive UGIB can present as haematochezia.

**In women of reproductive age**: always exclude ectopic pregnancy (β-hCG) and gynaecological causes (TOA, ovarian torsion, PID) before diagnosing diverticular disease.

**Meckel's diverticulitis** presents similarly to appendicitis; may be an incidental finding during appendicectomy; diagnosed by CT.

**Ischaemic colitis** has rapid onset + haematochezia (vs. gradual onset + constant pain in diverticulitis).

**IBD and infectious colitis**: diarrhoea predominates (vs. pain predominates in diverticulitis).
