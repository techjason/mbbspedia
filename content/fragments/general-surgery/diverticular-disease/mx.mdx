## Management of Diverticular Disease

Management of diverticular disease is entirely dictated by **which clinical entity you're dealing with** — asymptomatic diverticulosis, uncomplicated diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis (staged by Hinchey), diverticular bleeding, or chronic complications like fistula and stricture. Let me walk you through each systematically.

### 2. Management of Asymptomatic Diverticulosis

***Management: Conservative*** [5]

The vast majority (~80%) of people with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic and need **no medical or surgical treatment** — just risk factor modification to prevent progression.

| Intervention | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ***High-fibre diet*** [4] | Increases stool bulk → reduces intraluminal pressure (the fundamental pathogenic mechanism) → fewer new diverticula form and existing diverticula are less likely to become symptomatic. Aim for 25–30 g fibre/day |
| ***Bulk laxatives*** (e.g., ***methylcellulose***, psyllium/ispaghula husk) [4] | Hydrophilic agents that absorb water and swell → increase stool bulk → reduce colonic segmentation pressures. Unlike stimulant laxatives, these do NOT cause uncontrolled contractions |
| ***Weight reduction*** [4] | Obesity increases intra-abdominal pressure and promotes chronic inflammation |
| ***Avoid NSAIDs*** [4] | NSAIDs disrupt mucosal barrier (inhibit prostaglandin-mediated mucosal protection) → increase risk of microperforation and diverticular bleeding |
| ***Avoid stimulant laxatives*** [4] | Stimulant laxatives (e.g., senna, bisacodyl) cause forceful uncoordinated colonic contractions → increase intraluminal pressure → worsen diverticular disease. This is counterintuitive — patients think "laxatives help" but the wrong type makes things worse |
| Regular physical activity | Improves colonic motility and transit time, reducing intraluminal pressure |

<Callout title="Stimulant vs Bulk Laxatives — Know the Difference" type="error">
Students commonly recommend "laxatives" generically. In diverticular disease, **bulk-forming laxatives (methylcellulose, psyllium) are beneficial** but **stimulant laxatives (senna, bisacodyl) are harmful** because they cause high-pressure uncoordinated contractions. Always specify the type.
</Callout>

### 3. Management of SUDD

***Antispasmodics if colicky pain*** [4]:
- Mebeverine or hyoscine butylbromide — direct smooth muscle relaxants that reduce colonic spasm without affecting normal peristalsis
- Plus all the conservative measures above (high-fibre diet, bulk laxatives, weight loss)
- Some patients benefit from low-dose tricyclic antidepressants for visceral hypersensitivity (similar to IBS management)

---

### 4. Management of Uncomplicated Acute Diverticulitis

> ***Treatment: IV antibiotics*** [5]

> ***Colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks to rule out malignancy*** [5]

The goal is to **control the infection from the microperforation** with antibiotics and **rest the bowel** to allow healing.

#### Antibiotic Rationale

The colonic flora involved in diverticulitis include **Gram-negative aerobes** (e.g., *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*) and **anaerobes** (e.g., *Bacteroides fragilis*). Antibiotic regimens must therefore cover **both Gram-negatives AND anaerobes** [4].

#### A. Outpatient Treatment (Mild, Stable Patients)

**Who qualifies**: immunocompetent, tolerating oral intake, no significant comorbidities, reliable follow-up, no CT evidence of complications (Hinchey 0 — simple diverticulitis without abscess).

| Regimen | Duration | Spectrum |
|---|---|---|
| **Amoxicillin-clavulanate** (Augmentin) | 7–10 days | Broad-spectrum: GN aerobes + anaerobes (clavulanate = β-lactamase inhibitor extending amoxicillin's spectrum) |
| **Metronidazole + Co-trimoxazole** (TMP-SMX) | 7–10 days | Metronidazole covers anaerobes; co-trimoxazole covers GN aerobes |
| **Ciprofloxacin** (+ metronidazole if needed) | 7–10 days | Fluoroquinolone with excellent GN cover; add metronidazole for anaerobic coverage |
| **Moxifloxacin** | 7–10 days | 4th-generation fluoroquinolone with inherent anaerobic coverage (no need to add metronidazole) |

[3]

<Callout title="Evolving Practice — Antibiotics for Uncomplicated Diverticulitis" type="idea">
Recent evidence (AVOD trial 2012, DIABOLO trial 2017) suggests that **antibiotics may NOT be necessary** for truly uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients without systemic signs. Some guidelines now recommend **observation without antibiotics** for mild uncomplicated cases. However, for exam purposes, the standard teaching remains **antibiotics for 7–10 days** unless the examiner specifically asks about latest evidence.
</Callout>

#### B. Inpatient Treatment (More Severe / Cannot Tolerate PO)

**Who qualifies**: unable to tolerate oral intake, significant comorbidities, immunocompromised, failed outpatient treatment, or CT shows early complications.

| Component | Details | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Bowel rest (NPO)** | Nil by mouth | Reduces colonic motility and intraluminal pressure → allows the microperforation to seal; reduces ongoing bacterial contamination of the pericolic space |
| **IV fluid resuscitation** | Isotonic crystalloids (NS, Hartmann's) | Replace losses from reduced oral intake, vomiting, third-space fluid sequestration |
| **IV antibiotics** | ***Piperacillin-tazobactam*** (Tazocin) **OR** ***Metronidazole + Cephalosporin/Fluoroquinolone*** [3] | Piperacillin-tazobactam: ultra-broad spectrum covering GN aerobes, anaerobes, and many Gram-positives. Alternative: metronidazole (anaerobes) + ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin (GN aerobes) |
| **Analgesia** | Paracetamol first-line; avoid opioids if possible | Opioids slow colonic transit → increase intraluminal pressure; but may be needed for severe pain |
| **Monitoring** | Clinical: pain, fever, abdominal exam, vitals; Bloods: WCC, CRP trending | Look for improvement within 48–72 hours; failure to improve suggests complication (abscess, perforation) |

> After resolution: ***Colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks to rule out malignancy*** [5]

---

### 5. Management of Complicated Diverticulitis

> ***Resuscitation with IVF + antibiotics. Percutaneous drainage for abscess. Consider emergency surgery*** [5]

#### Indications for Emergency Surgery [3][5]

***Consider emergency surgery when*** [5]:
- ***Unresponsive to antibiotics***
- ***Septic shock (high fever, tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria)***
- ***Generalised peritonitis (Hinchey III and IV)***

Additional indications [3]:
- Frank (free) perforation
- Colonic obstruction not amenable to conservative management
- Abscess failing non-operative intervention (CT-guided drainage)

#### Management by Hinchey Stage

| ***Hinchey Stage*** | ***Management*** | ***Rationale*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***I — Pericolic abscess*** | ***IV antibiotics ± CT-guided percutaneous drainage*** [4][5] | Small pericolic abscess ( < 5 cm) may resolve with antibiotics alone. Larger abscess ( ≥ 5 cm) requires drainage to achieve source control. CT-guided drainage avoids surgery in many patients |
| ***II — Distant abscess (pelvic/retroperitoneal)*** | ***IV antibiotics + CT-guided percutaneous drainage*** [4][5] | Distant abscess is too large and too far from the primary site to resolve with antibiotics alone; percutaneous drainage achieves source control and may serve as a "bridge" to interval elective surgery |
| ***III — Generalised purulent peritonitis*** | ***Emergency surgery*** [4][5] | Ruptured abscess has contaminated the peritoneal cavity → conservative management will not achieve source control → requires operative washout and resection |
| ***IV — Generalised faecal peritonitis*** | ***Emergency surgery (Hartmann's procedure)*** [4][5] | Free bowel perforation with faecal contamination → highest mortality (50%) → definitive surgical source control is mandatory |

#### When Conservative Management Fails [3][4]

If a patient on IV antibiotics ± drainage does **not improve within 48–72 hours** (persistent fever, worsening pain, rising WCC/CRP), you must:
1. **Repeat CT** to reassess — look for enlarging abscess, new perforation, or missed diagnosis
2. **Escalate to surgery** if the source is not controllable non-operatively

---

### 6. Surgical Treatment Options

***Surgical options*** [5]: ***Resection, Primary anastomosis, Stoma (Hartmann's), Laparoscopic lavage*** [5]

#### A. Colonic Resection with Primary Anastomosis (1-Stage Procedure)

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Indication** | ***Hinchey I or II*** diverticulitis (localised contamination) where the patient can tolerate preoperative bowel preparation and tissues are not too oedematous/inflamed [3] |
| **What's done** | Resection of the diseased colonic segment including the abscess, with immediate anastomosis (joining the two bowel ends) |
| **Resection margins** | **Proximal**: where colon becomes soft, uninflamed, and non-oedematous. It is ***NOT necessary to resect all diverticulum-bearing colon*** since diverticula in the transverse or descending colon rarely cause further symptoms [3]. **Distal**: upper 1/3 of the rectum (because the rectum is NEVER involved in diverticulitis — taeniae coli have fused by that point) [3] |
| **Advantage** | Single operation; no stoma; better quality of life |
| **Risk** | Anastomotic leak — higher risk if performed in contaminated/inflamed field |

<Callout title="Resection Margins — A Classic Exam Point">
You do NOT need to resect every single diverticulum. The proximal margin is where the colon becomes soft and uninflamed. The distal margin must reach the **upper rectum** — ***inadequate distal margin is the most common cause of recurrent diverticulitis after resection*** [4]. This is because the diseased, high-pressure sigmoid colon must be completely removed; leaving even a short stump of sigmoid leads to recurrence.
</Callout>

#### B. Hartmann's Procedure (2-Stage Procedure)

> ***The MOST commonly performed and preferred approach*** for emergency surgery [3]

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Indication** | ***Hinchey III or IV*** diverticulitis (diffuse contamination) [3][4]. Also used when anastomosis is too risky (haemodynamic instability, severe contamination, immunosuppression) |
| **Stage I** | Resection of the diseased colonic segment → creation of an **end colostomy** (proximal limb brought out as a stoma to divert the faecal stream) + creation of a **rectal stump** (Hartmann's pouch) by oversewing the distal rectum [3] |
| **Stage II** (reversal, typically 3–6 months later) | Intestinal continuity is re-established by a **descending colorectostomy** (takedown of colostomy and anastomosis to the rectal stump) [3] |
| **Why 2-stage?** | ***Primary anastomosis is contraindicated in Hinchey III-IV*** because excessive contamination and inflamed/oedematous tissues dramatically increase the risk of **anastomotic leak** [3][4] — an anastomotic leak in a septic patient with peritonitis would be catastrophic |
| **Disadvantage** | Stoma-related morbidity; reversal of Hartmann's is a technically challenging operation (adhesions, difficult pelvic dissection to find the rectal stump); up to 30-40% of Hartmann's procedures are never reversed |

**Why is anastomotic leak so dangerous?**
An anastomotic leak means the joined bowel ends have separated → faecal matter leaks into the peritoneal cavity → peritonitis, sepsis, multi-organ failure. Risk factors for leak include ischaemia, tension, infection, malnutrition, steroids, and performing anastomosis in a contaminated field [4]. This is exactly why you DON'T do a primary anastomosis in Hinchey III-IV.

#### C. Colonic Resection with Primary Anastomosis + Defunctioning Loop Ileostomy (2-Stage Procedure)

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Indication** | ***Hinchey III or IV*** in **stable patients** where the bowel is not excessively oedematous [3]; OR Hinchey I-II with relative contraindication to primary anastomosis alone |
| **What's done** | Resection + primary anastomosis (as in 1-stage) BUT with a **proximal defunctioning loop ileostomy** to divert the faecal stream away from the anastomosis → protects the anastomosis while it heals |
| **Stage II** | Reversal of the loop ileostomy (a technically **simpler** procedure than reversal of Hartmann's) [3] |
| **Advantage over Hartmann's** | Maintains bowel continuity from the outset; reversal of loop ileostomy is easier than takedown of a Hartmann's pouch [3] |
| **Disadvantage** | Only appropriate in stable patients; still requires a second operation |

#### D. Laparoscopic Lavage

> ***Laparoscopic lavage — feasible*** [5]

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Indication** | ***Hinchey III*** (purulent peritonitis) — the bowel wall itself is intact (no free faecal perforation) [3][5] |
| **What's done** | Laparoscopic washout of the peritoneal cavity with warm saline + placement of drains. The diseased bowel segment is **NOT resected** |
| **Rationale** | In Hinchey III, the peritonitis is from a ruptured abscess (pus), not a free bowel perforation. The bowel wall is intact. So theoretically, washing out the pus and giving antibiotics may be sufficient without the morbidity of resection + stoma |
| **Advantage** | Avoids bowel resection and stoma; faster recovery; lower morbidity |
| **Controversy** | ***This approach remains controversial and requires additional prospective trials before formal recommendations*** [3]. The SCANDIV and LOLA trials showed higher re-intervention rates with lavage compared to resection. Current consensus: may be considered in selected cases (Hinchey III, stable patient) but NOT standard of care |
| **Contraindication** | Hinchey IV (faecal peritonitis) — you CANNOT just wash out faecal contamination without resecting the perforated bowel |

---

### 7. Elective (Interval) Colectomy

***Interval colectomy*** — this is a planned sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis performed **after resolution of the acute episode** (typically 6–12 weeks later) [5].

#### Indications for Elective Interval Colectomy [3][5]

| Indication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ***Previous complicated diverticulitis*** | History of abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction indicates high-risk anatomy prone to recurrence and further complications [3][5] |
| ***Immunocompromised patients*** | Impaired immune response means complications are harder to manage conservatively; lower threshold for surgery. These patients may not mount the usual inflammatory "walling-off" response → higher risk of free perforation |
| ***Inability to exclude malignancy*** | If colonoscopy post-recovery cannot definitively exclude CRC (e.g., stricture preventing passage of scope, persistent mass), resection serves both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes [3] |
| ***Patients with complicated disease, aged > 50, female, the privately insured, and those at teaching hospitals*** [5] | Epidemiological data showing these groups are more likely to undergo and benefit from interval colectomy |
| **Chronic fistula** | Colovesical or colovaginal fistula will not close spontaneously — requires surgical resection |
| **Chronic stricture causing obstruction** | Fibrotic stricture will not resolve with antibiotics — needs resection |

#### What Is NO LONGER an Indication [3][5]

> ***Recurrent episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis*** — this is **NO LONGER** an automatic indication for surgery [3]

***"Outcomes of > 2 episodes of attacks are not worse"*** [5]

***"85% do not recur after initial medical treatment"*** [5]

- **Old teaching**: after 2 episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis, patients should undergo elective colectomy (the "2-strike rule") because it was believed the risk of complications increased with each recurrence
- **Current evidence**: this has been **disproven**. The risk of complications does NOT significantly increase with recurrent uncomplicated episodes. Most patients (85%) will not have a recurrence after successful medical treatment of their first episode [3][5]
- **Current practice**: decision for surgery is based on the **severity of episodes and patient factors** (complications, immunosuppression, inability to exclude malignancy), NOT simply the number of episodes

> ***Recurrence rate: 10–30% in the first decade after initial attack*** [5]

> ***Elective interval colectomy: not related to recurrence episodes*** [5]

<Callout title="The 2-Strike Rule Is Dead" type="error">
This is a very commonly tested concept. The old "2 attacks = surgery" rule is **outdated**. Modern guidelines (AGA 2015, ASCRS 2020) recommend surgery based on **disease severity and patient factors**, not simply the number of episodes. Know this for your exam — it's a favourite trap question.
</Callout>

#### Surgical Technique for Elective Colectomy

- **Sigmoid colectomy with primary anastomosis** (1-stage procedure)
- Can be performed **laparoscopically** (preferred — less morbidity, faster recovery, fewer adhesions)
- Same resection margin principles: proximal = soft uninflamed colon; distal = upper rectum
- No stoma needed (bowel is not inflamed/contaminated at the time of elective surgery)

---

### 8. Management of Specific Complications

#### A. Abscess

| Size / Response | Management |
|---|---|
| **Small ( < 5 cm)** | IV antibiotics alone — likely to resolve [4] |
| **Large ( ≥ 5 cm)** | ***CT-guided percutaneous drainage*** + IV antibiotics [4][5] |
| **Failed drainage / persistent sepsis** | Emergency surgery (resection ± stoma) [3][5] |

**Why CT-guided drainage works**: inserting a drain directly into the abscess cavity under CT guidance achieves **source control** — the pus is evacuated, the bacterial load is dramatically reduced, and antibiotics can then sterilise the residual infection. This often converts what would have been an emergency operation into a controlled situation amenable to interval elective surgery.

#### B. Fistula [3][4]

- **Colovesical fistula** (most common): ***Resection of affected colon + omental pedicle interposition between bowel and bladder*** (to prevent recurrent fistulation) ***+ synchronous repair of bladder*** (primary closure) [4]
- **Colovaginal fistula**: resection of affected colon + primary closure or repair of vaginal defect
- **Coloenteric / colocutaneous fistula**: resection of affected colon ± repair of secondary organ
- Management principle: **control sepsis first** (antibiotics, drainage), then **definitive surgery** — resection of the fistula-bearing colon with repair of the secondarily involved organ [3]

> ***Fistula is usually managed at the index operation with resection of the affected segment of colon*** [3]

#### C. Obstruction

| Type | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Partial obstruction** (acute) | Pericolonic inflammation/oedema or compression by abscess → luminal narrowing | Conservative: bowel rest, IV fluids, NG decompression, IV antibiotics → usually resolves with resolution of inflammation |
| **Complete obstruction** (chronic) | Recurrent diverticulitis → progressive fibrosis → stricture | May require endoscopic stenting as a bridge to surgery, or direct surgical resection. Hartmann's in emergency; primary anastomosis with on-table lavage if stable |
| **SBO from adhesion** | Small bowel adheres to inflamed sigmoid colon | Standard SBO management: drip and suck → surgical adhesiolysis if not resolving |

#### D. Perforation with Peritonitis [3][4][5]

***Emergency surgery*** — the management depends on Hinchey stage:
- Hinchey III: Hartmann's procedure OR primary anastomosis with defunctioning stoma OR laparoscopic lavage (in selected cases)
- Hinchey IV: ***Hartmann's procedure*** with on-table peritoneal lavage [4]

---

### 9. Management of Diverticular Bleeding

> ***Common cause of severe GI bleeding. Intermittent bleeding. 80% self-limiting*** [1][5]

#### Step 1: Resuscitation [3]

| Action | Details |
|---|---|
| **IV access** | Two large-bore (16G or 14G) peripheral cannulae |
| **IV fluids** | Rapid bolus of isotonic crystalloid (NS or Hartmann's) |
| **Blood transfusion** | Transfuse if Hb < 7 g/dL (low-risk) or < 9 g/dL (high-risk, e.g., elderly, IHD) [3] |
| **Cross-match** | Group and save; cross-match 4–6 units packed RBCs |
| **Correct coagulopathy** | FFP for coagulopathy; platelets if thrombocytopaenic; withhold anticoagulants/antiplatelets (weigh against thrombotic risk) [3] |
| **Monitoring** | Vital signs, urine output, cardiac monitoring |

#### Step 2: Localisation and Haemostasis — Stepwise Escalation

***Investigation: Colonoscopy. Management: Conservative → Endoscopic haemostasis → Angiogram ± embolisation*** [5]

| Step | Modality | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **1st line** | ***Conservative*** [5] | ***50% of diverticular bleeding stops spontaneously*** [4]. Observe with ongoing resuscitation |
| **2nd line** | ***Colonoscopy with endoscopic haemostasis*** [5] | Identify the bleeding diverticulum and achieve haemostasis: **adrenaline injection (1:10,000)** (vasoconstriction — NOT used alone) + **metallic clips** or **band ligation** (mechanical compression of the bleeding vessel) [3][4] |
| **3rd line** | ***Mesenteric angiography ± embolisation*** [5] | When colonoscopy fails to localise or control bleeding. Selective catheterisation of the bleeding artery → superselective embolisation (coils, gelfoam). Detects bleeding > 1 mL/min [3] |
| **4th line** | **On-table lavage with intraoperative colonoscopy** | Bowel lavage through a caecostomy/appendicostomy during laparotomy → colonoscopy to identify bleeding source intraoperatively [4] |
| **Last resort** | ***Subtotal colectomy + ileostomy*** [4] | When the bleeding source ***cannot be identified*** despite all the above. Removing the entire colon eliminates the source regardless of location. Significant morbidity — reserved as a life-saving measure |

***Localisation of bleeding: colonoscopy → angiography → on-table lavage and colonoscopy → subtotal colectomy and ileostomy*** [4]

#### Indications for Emergency Laparotomy in Diverticular Bleeding [3]

| Indication | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Haemodynamically unstable despite adequate resuscitation** | Ongoing arterial haemorrhage exceeding the body's compensatory capacity |
| **Excessive blood transfusion > 6 units** | Massive transfusion carries its own complications (hypothermia, coagulopathy, hyperkalaemia, citrate toxicity) — continued bleeding requiring this much blood warrants definitive surgical control |
| **Frequent rebleeding or persistent bleeding** | Endoscopic/angiographic measures have failed to achieve durable haemostasis |

---

### 10. Management of Right-Sided Diverticulitis (Hong Kong Relevance)

Right-sided (caecal) diverticulitis deserves special mention because it is **more common in Asian populations** and is managed differently:

| Feature | Approach |
|---|---|
| **Uncomplicated right-sided diverticulitis** | Conservative management with IV antibiotics (same principles as left-sided) |
| **Complicated / recurrent right-sided diverticulitis** | **Right hemicolectomy** (NOT Hartmann's — Hinchey classification does not apply to right-sided disease) |
| **Diagnostic challenge** | CT abdomen to distinguish from acute appendicitis (see DDx section) |

---

### 11. Summary Table: Management by Clinical Scenario

| Scenario | Management |
|---|---|
| **Asymptomatic diverticulosis** | ***Conservative: high-fibre diet, bulk laxatives, weight reduction. Avoid NSAIDs and stimulant laxatives*** |
| **SUDD** | Conservative + ***antispasmodics*** for colicky pain |
| **Uncomplicated diverticulitis (outpatient)** | ***PO antibiotics 7–10 days*** (Augmentin, or metronidazole + co-trimoxazole/ciprofloxacin, or moxifloxacin) |
| **Uncomplicated diverticulitis (inpatient)** | ***IV antibiotics*** (pip-taz OR metronidazole + cephalosporin/fluoroquinolone) + bowel rest |
| **Hinchey I** | ***IV antibiotics ± CT-guided drainage*** |
| **Hinchey II** | ***IV antibiotics + CT-guided percutaneous drainage*** |
| **Hinchey III** | ***Emergency surgery: Hartmann's / primary anastomosis + defunctioning stoma / laparoscopic lavage*** |
| **Hinchey IV** | ***Emergency surgery: Hartmann's procedure*** |
| **Diverticular bleeding** | ***Resuscitate → conservative (50% self-limiting) → colonoscopy (endoscopic haemostasis) → angiography ± embolisation → surgery*** |
| **Fistula** | ***Elective resection of affected colon + repair of secondary organ*** |
| **Stricture/obstruction** | ***Elective resection*** if chronic; emergency surgery if acute complete obstruction |
| **Interval colectomy** | For ***complicated diverticulitis history, immunocompromised, inability to exclude malignancy.*** NOT for recurrent uncomplicated episodes |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Asymptomatic diverticulosis**: conservative only — high-fibre diet, bulk laxatives (NOT stimulant laxatives), avoid NSAIDs, weight loss.

**Uncomplicated diverticulitis**: antibiotics covering GN aerobes + anaerobes (outpatient: Augmentin or metronidazole + ciprofloxacin; inpatient: piperacillin-tazobactam or metronidazole + cephalosporin). Colonoscopy at 6–8 weeks to exclude CRC.

**Complicated diverticulitis by Hinchey stage**: I–II = IV antibiotics + CT-guided drainage; III–IV = emergency surgery. Hartmann's procedure is the most commonly performed emergency operation (2-stage: resection + end colostomy → later reversal).

**Primary anastomosis is contraindicated in Hinchey III–IV** due to risk of anastomotic leak in the contaminated/inflamed field.

**Laparoscopic lavage** is feasible for Hinchey III but remains controversial.

**Inadequate distal resection margin is the MC cause of recurrent diverticulitis post-surgery** — always resect down to the upper rectum.

**The "2-strike rule" is dead**: recurrent uncomplicated diverticulitis alone is NOT an indication for surgery. 85% do not recur after initial medical treatment.

**Diverticular bleeding**: 80% self-limiting. Stepwise escalation: conservative → colonoscopy (clips/adrenaline) → angiography ± embolisation → on-table lavage → subtotal colectomy if source unidentifiable.

**Indications for emergency surgery**: free perforation, failed antibiotics, septic shock, generalised peritonitis (Hinchey III–IV), obstruction, abscess failing drainage. Indications for laparotomy in bleeding: haemodynamic instability despite resuscitation, > 6 units transfused, persistent/recurrent bleeding.
