## Complications of Head and Neck Cancer

Complications in H&N cancer arise from **three sources**: the disease itself (tumour-related), the treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), and the interaction between these. Understanding complications from first principles requires you to think anatomically — *what structures are being damaged, and what functions do those structures serve?*

***Head and Neck cancer: problems*** [5]:
- ***Most frequently exposed region of the body***
- ***Anatomical disruption will affect morphology and physiology***

This one slide captures everything. The head and neck is where form meets function. Every complication can be traced back to disruption of structure (morphology) or disruption of what that structure does (physiology).

### 1. Disease-Related Complications (From the Tumour Itself)

These are complications that arise because the cancer grows, invades, obstructs, or metastasises.

#### 1.1 Airway Obstruction

***Airway*** [5]:
- ***Temporary — swelling***
- ***Permanent — tumour / stricture***

**Why?** Tumours of the larynx (especially supraglottic and subglottic), hypopharynx, tongue base, and oropharynx can grow large enough to physically obstruct the airway lumen. Remember that stridor indicates > 50% luminal obstruction — by the time you hear stridor, the situation is already critical.

**Mechanism**:
- **Direct tumour bulk** — endoluminal mass narrows the airway
- **Vocal cord fixation** — tumour invading the recurrent laryngeal nerve or cricoarytenoid joint causes cord immobility. If bilateral, the cords fix in the adducted (closed) position → complete obstruction
- **Peritumoral oedema and bleeding** — can cause acute-on-chronic obstruction

**Management**: ***ALWAYS protect the airway for all H&N cancer*** [2]. Emergency tracheostomy or intubation if acute obstruction; elective tracheostomy before definitive treatment if airway is borderline.

#### 1.2 Dysphagia and Malnutrition

***Swallowing*** [5]:
- ***Voluntary phase usually affected by tumours in the head and neck region***
- ***Usually immediately after glossectomy or pharyngectomy***
- ***Sometimes delayed presentation after radiotherapy***

**Why?** The voluntary (oral preparatory and oral propulsive) phase of swallowing requires intact tongue mobility, buccal function, palatal closure, and pharyngeal constriction. Tumours of the tongue, floor of mouth, oropharynx, and hypopharynx directly impair these mechanics.

**Consequences**:
- Progressive dysphagia → reduced oral intake → weight loss → cancer cachexia
- Dehydration
- Aspiration pneumonia (when swallowing mechanism fails to protect the airway)

#### 1.3 Aspiration Pneumonia

When the tumour disrupts the normal swallow mechanism (laryngeal elevation, epiglottic deflection, vocal cord closure), food and saliva enter the trachea → aspiration → pneumonia. This is particularly common in:
- Supraglottic tumours (epiglottis/aryepiglottic fold involved)
- Tongue base tumours (loss of tongue base retraction during swallowing)
- Post-treatment (after glossectomy, partial laryngectomy, or CRT)

#### 1.4 Haemorrhage

Tumours can erode into blood vessels → bleeding. The severity depends on which vessel is involved:
- **Minor**: Mucosal bleeding from tumour surface (epistaxis in NPC, blood-stained saliva in oral cancers)
- **Major/Life-threatening**: Carotid artery blow-out — tumour erodes into the carotid artery (or post-treatment with wound breakdown over the carotid). This is a catastrophic emergency with massive haemorrhage. Risk factors: previous surgery + RT, wound infection/fistula, recurrent tumour encasing the carotid.

#### 1.5 Cranial Nerve Palsies (NPC-Specific)

NPC can invade the skull base and enter the cavernous sinus or jugular foramen → progressive cranial neuropathies (CN III–VI, IX–XII, sympathetic chain). These are complications of the disease itself and indicate advanced local extension.

#### 1.6 Distant Metastasis

- NPC: ***Bone (75%), liver, lung, distant LN*** [2]
- Other H&N cancers: Lung > bone > liver
- Complications of distant metastases: pathological fractures (bone), hepatic failure (liver), respiratory failure (lung)

#### 1.7 Second Primary Tumours (Field Cancerization)

This is a unique "complication" of H&N cancer — not from the original tumour spreading, but from the field cancerization effect [2]:
- ***Synchronous tumour = Second primary tumour detected within 6 months***
- ***Metachronous tumour = Second primary tumour detected > 6 months***
- ***Oral cavity/oropharynx tumours → second primary in upper oesophagus***
- ***Laryngeal tumours → second primary in lung***

This is why lifelong surveillance and panendoscopy are necessary.

### 2. Surgery-Related Complications

#### 2.1 General Surgical Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Bleeding / Haematoma** | Reactionary (< 24h) or secondary (> 24h, infection-related) bleeding from surgical bed | ***Haematoma in the neck is potentially fatal*** — can compress venous return → laryngeal oedema → airway obstruction → asphyxiation [8]. **First action**: remove all skin sutures at the bedside to decompress, then resuscitate and return to theatre for haemostasis [8] |
| **Wound infection** | Oral cavity surgery involves a "clean-contaminated" field (the mouth is colonised) → higher infection risk than clean surgery | Prophylactic antibiotics covering oral flora (e.g., co-amoxiclav) |
| **Flap failure** | Microvascular free flap — thrombosis of arterial inflow or venous outflow → flap necrosis | Occurs in ~3–5% of free flaps. Requires close monitoring (colour, temperature, capillary refill) in the first 48–72 hours. Early return to theatre for re-exploration if suspected |

#### 2.2 Specific Complications by Surgical Procedure

##### 2.2.1 Complications of Total Laryngectomy [2]

This is one of the most important sections for exams because total laryngectomy has profound and permanent consequences.

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|:--|:--|
| ***Loss of ability to speak*** [2] | The larynx is removed → the vibrating vocal cords are gone. Voice rehabilitation is essential (tracheoesophageal puncture with voice prosthesis, oesophageal speech, or electrolarynx) |
| ***Loss of coughing effort*** [2] | The glottis normally closes to build subglottic pressure for an effective cough (Valsalva mechanism). Without a larynx, the patient cannot generate this pressure → weak cough → retained secretions. The permanent tracheostomy bypasses the upper airway completely |
| ***Swallowing dysfunction*** [2] — ***Stricture of neopharynx or anastomosis / Regurgitation*** | The pharynx is reconstructed (neopharynx) and the anastomosis site can stenose from scarring → progressive dysphagia. Managed with serial dilatation |
| ***Endocrine dysfunction*** [2] — ***Hypothyroidism / Hypoparathyroidism*** | Part or all of the thyroid gland and associated parathyroid glands may be removed depending on extent of disease [2]. Loss of thyroid → hypothyroidism (requires lifelong thyroxine). Loss of parathyroids → hypocalcaemia (perioral numbness, carpopedal spasm, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign; severe cases → ***laryngospasm*** [8]) |
| **Permanent tracheostomy** | Upper aerodigestive tract and digestive tract are permanently disconnected [2] → patient breathes through a stoma. ***Stigmatisation with the presence of permanent tracheostomy*** [2] — significant psychological and social impact |
| **Pharyngocutaneous fistula** | Breakdown of the pharyngeal closure → saliva leaks through the neck wound onto the skin. One of the most common early complications. Risk factors: previous RT, malnutrition, positive margins |

##### 2.2.2 Complications of Partial Laryngectomy [2]

***Complications*** [2]:
- ***Laryngocutaneous fistula*** — communication between laryngeal lumen and skin
- ***Aspiration pneumonia*** — partial laryngectomy preserves some laryngeal framework but may compromise the sphincteric protective function → chronic aspiration
- ***Swallowing difficulties***
- ***Bleeding and infection***

##### 2.2.3 Complications of Neck Dissection

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| **Spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) injury** | Intentional sacrifice in radical neck dissection, or inadvertent injury during modified radical/selective dissection → trapezius denervation → shoulder drop, chronic pain, inability to abduct shoulder above 90° (shoulder syndrome). This is the most significant morbidity of neck dissection |
| **Internal jugular vein (IJV) ligation** | If bilateral radical neck dissection removes both IJVs → severe facial oedema, raised intracranial pressure. This is why bilateral radical neck dissection is rarely performed simultaneously |
| **Marginal mandibular nerve injury** | Branch of CN VII; runs superficially near the submandibular gland. Damage → drooping of ipsilateral lower lip. This is relevant during Level I dissection |
| **Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) injury** | Runs deep to the posterior belly of digastric. Damage → ipsilateral tongue deviation and atrophy → impaired speech and swallowing |
| **Phrenic nerve injury** | C3–C5; runs on the anterior surface of scalenus anterior. Rare but serious → ipsilateral hemidiaphragm paralysis → respiratory compromise |
| **Thoracic duct injury** | Left Level IV/V dissection can injure the thoracic duct → chylous fistula (milky drainage from neck wound). Managed conservatively (pressure dressing, medium-chain triglyceride diet) or surgically (ligation) if persistent |
| **Carotid artery injury** | Rare during surgery; more common as a late complication when post-operative wound breakdown exposes the carotid → "carotid blow-out" |
| **Lymphoedema** | Disruption of cervical lymphatic drainage → facial/submental oedema |

##### 2.2.4 Complications of Parotid Surgery [2]

***Complications*** [2]:
- ***Facial nerve injury*** — the facial nerve (CN VII) runs through the parotid gland. Even in benign tumour surgery, the nerve must be carefully dissected. Temporary neuropraxia is common (10–20%); permanent injury is rarer but more likely with malignant tumours requiring nerve sacrifice
- ***Frey syndrome*** [2]:
  - ***Also known as auriculotemporal syndrome or gustatory sweating***
  - ***Characterised by sweating and flushing of facial skin over parotid bed and neck during mastication***
  - ***Result of aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres between the otic ganglion and salivary tissues which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels*** [2]

Why does Frey syndrome happen? During parotidectomy, the auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of CN V3 carrying parasympathetic fibres to the parotid from the otic ganglion) is divided. During wound healing, regenerating parasympathetic nerve fibres that were destined for the parotid gland instead grow into the cut ends of sympathetic nerves supplying **sweat glands** in the overlying skin. So when the patient eats (stimulus that should trigger salivation), they instead sweat and flush over the parotid region — the wrong effector organ gets activated. Treatment options include antiperspirants (aluminium chloride), botulinum toxin injection (blocks cholinergic transmission at the sweat gland), or interposition of tissue (e.g., sternocleidomastoid muscle flap) between the parotid bed and the skin during surgery.

##### 2.2.5 Complications of Oral Cavity Surgery

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| **Impaired speech/articulation** | ***Resection of large tumours of tongue that lead to decreased lingual contact with palate, lip, and teeth will result in impaired articulation*** [2]. The tongue is the primary articulator for consonant sounds (t, d, n, l, s, z) |
| **Impaired swallowing** | Loss of tongue bulk and mobility → cannot form bolus, cannot propel it posteriorly. ***Reconstruction using soft pliable fasciocutaneous free flaps can provide intraoral bulk and preservation of tongue mobility*** [2] |
| **Trismus** | Fibrosis of pterygoid muscles or temporomandibular joint from surgery ± RT |
| **Oro-antral / Oro-nasal fistula** | After maxillectomy or palatal resection → communication between oral and nasal/sinus cavities → nasal regurgitation. ***Through-and-through defects of palate require dental prosthesis*** [2] |
| **Mandibular discontinuity** | After segmental mandibulectomy → loss of mandibular arch continuity → cosmetic deformity, malocclusion, difficulty chewing. Reconstructed with fibula free flap |

### 3. Radiotherapy-Related Complications

Radiotherapy damages both tumour cells and surrounding normal tissue. The complications depend on which normal structures are in the radiation field. Think of RT complications in **acute** (during/shortly after RT) and **late** (months to years after RT) categories.

#### 3.1 Acute Complications (During or Within Weeks of RT)

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|:--|:--|
| ***Radiation dermatitis*** [2] | Direct radiation damage to skin → erythema → dry desquamation → moist desquamation (blistering, peeling). Like a severe sunburn. The skin in the radiation field becomes red, tender, and eventually may ulcerate |
| **Mucositis** | Radiation destroys rapidly dividing mucosal epithelial cells → painful ulceration of the oropharyngeal mucosa. This is the most debilitating acute side effect — patients cannot eat, drink, or swallow their own saliva. Often requires PEG tube placement for nutrition. ***Mouth and throat sores*** [2] |
| ***Odynophagia*** [2] | Direct consequence of mucositis → severe pain on swallowing |
| ***Dysphagia*** [2] | Mucositis + oedema → difficulty swallowing |
| ***Hoarseness*** [2] | Laryngeal oedema from RT to the larynx |
| **Taste alteration (dysgeusia)** | Radiation damages taste buds on the tongue → altered or absent taste. Usually begins within 1–2 weeks and can last months |
| **Nausea** | If posterior fossa/brainstem is in the field (NPC) |

#### 3.2 Late Complications (Months to Years After RT)

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|:--|:--|
| **Xerostomia (dry mouth)** | Radiation damages serous acini of salivary glands (parotid is most sensitive because it is predominantly serous). Salivary flow decreases → dry mouth → difficulty eating, speaking, sleeping; rapid dental caries. Modern IMRT techniques aim to spare the contralateral parotid to preserve some salivary function. This is the **most common chronic complaint** after H&N RT |
| **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN)** of the mandible | Radiation causes endarteritis obliterans (obliteration of small blood vessels in bone) → the mandible becomes **hypovascular, hypocellular, and hypoxic** (the "3H's" of ORN). If the irradiated bone is traumatised (e.g., tooth extraction), it cannot mount a healing response → chronic, painful, non-healing bone exposure. This is why **pre-RT dental assessment and extraction of carious teeth is mandatory** |
| ***Laryngeal oedema*** [2] | Chronic oedema of the laryngeal mucosa from radiation-induced lymphatic damage → voice change, airway compromise |
| ***Laryngeal or pharyngeal stenosis*** [2] | Late fibrosis of irradiated tissue → progressive narrowing of the airway or pharynx → stridor, dysphagia |
| **Radiation fibrosis / Trismus** | Fibrosis of muscles of mastication (especially medial and lateral pterygoids) → progressive inability to open the mouth. Can be very debilitating; managed with jaw-stretching exercises (TheraBite) |
| **Hypothyroidism** | If the thyroid gland is in the RT field (common in laryngeal, hypopharyngeal RT, and NPC bilateral neck irradiation) → progressive thyroid gland destruction → hypothyroidism. Annual TSH monitoring is mandatory for all H&N RT patients |
| **Dental caries (radiation caries)** | Consequence of xerostomia — reduced salivary flow removes the protective buffering/antimicrobial effect of saliva → rampant dental decay, especially at the cementoenamel junction. Fluoride trays and meticulous dental hygiene are essential |
| **Carotid artery stenosis** | Radiation accelerates atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries → increased stroke risk years after RT. Doppler surveillance may be indicated |
| **Radiation-induced second malignancy** | Radiation is itself a carcinogen. Years after RT, a new cancer can develop within the irradiated field (e.g., sarcoma, new SCC). Rare but well-documented; latency typically > 5 years |
| **Hearing loss (sensorineural)** | If cochlea is in the field (NPC RT) → radiation cochleitis → high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. Compounded by cisplatin ototoxicity |

<Callout title="Osteoradionecrosis — Prevention is Key" type="error">
ORN is far easier to **prevent** than to **treat**. All patients must have a dental assessment before starting RT. Carious teeth in the radiation field must be extracted and allowed to heal (minimum 2–3 weeks) before RT begins. After RT, any required extractions should be done with extreme caution — hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy may be used prophylactically in high-risk patients.

### 4. Chemotherapy-Related Complications

***Cisplatin*** side effects [2]:
- ***Nephrotoxicity*** — cisplatin is directly toxic to renal tubular cells. Aggressive IV hydration before and after each cycle is mandatory. Monitor creatinine and GFR. If GFR < 50, switch to carboplatin
- ***Ototoxicity*** — damage to outer hair cells of the cochlea → bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (irreversible). Particularly problematic when combined with RT to the cochlea (NPC). Audiometric monitoring required
- ***Nausea and vomiting (76–100%)*** [2] — cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic chemotherapy agents. Requires triple antiemetic prophylaxis (5-HT3 antagonist + NK1 antagonist + dexamethasone)
- Peripheral neuropathy — dose-dependent, cumulative, "stocking-glove" distribution
- Myelosuppression (less marked than with other agents but still significant)

***Fluorouracil (5-FU)*** side effects [2]:
- ***Myelosuppression (Pancytopenia)*** — suppresses rapidly dividing bone marrow progenitors → neutropenia (infection risk), anaemia (fatigue), thrombocytopenia (bleeding)
- ***Alopecia*** — hair follicle cells are rapidly dividing and are collateral damage
- ***Stomatitis*** — 5-FU damages oral mucosal cells → painful mouth ulcers (compounding RT mucositis)
- ***Diarrhoea*** — GI mucosal cells are rapidly dividing → damage → secretory diarrhoea. Can be severe and life-threatening

---

### 5. Immunotherapy-Related Complications

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) "release the brakes" on the immune system. The downside is that the unleashed immune system can attack normal tissues → **immune-related adverse events (irAEs)**:

| irAE | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| **Pneumonitis** | T-cell-mediated lung inflammation → cough, dyspnoea. Can be fatal. Requires steroids |
| **Hepatitis** | Immune-mediated hepatocyte damage → elevated transaminases |
| **Colitis** | Immune-mediated GI mucosal inflammation → diarrhoea, abdominal pain |
| **Thyroiditis / Hypothyroidism** | Immune destruction of thyroid → transient thyrotoxicosis → hypothyroidism |
| **Dermatitis** | Pruritic maculopapular rash |
| **Hypophysitis** | Inflammation of pituitary → pan-hypopituitarism (ACTH deficiency is most dangerous → adrenal crisis) |

Management: mild irAEs → hold immunotherapy; moderate to severe → systemic corticosteroids; severe/refractory → immunosuppressants (infliximab, mycophenolate).

---

### 6. Functional and Psychosocial Complications

These are often underappreciated but profoundly impact quality of life.

***Rehabilitation always — swallowing, voice and hearing*** [3]

| Domain | Complication | Pathophysiology |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Speech** | Dysarthria, aphonia | Loss of tongue bulk (glossectomy), loss of palatal closure (maxillectomy), loss of vocal cords (laryngectomy) |
| ***Swallowing*** [5] | ***Voluntary phase usually affected by tumours in the head and neck region. Usually immediately after glossectomy or pharyngectomy. Sometimes delayed presentation after radiotherapy*** | Loss of tongue mobility, pharyngeal stenosis, reduced laryngeal elevation, fibrosis, xerostomia |
| **Breathing** | Permanent tracheostomy dependency | After total laryngectomy — upper airway and digestive tract permanently disconnected |
| **Cosmetic disfigurement** | Facial asymmetry, mandibular defects, neck scarring | Resection of visible structures → psychosocial distress, social isolation |
| **Depression and anxiety** | Reactive to diagnosis, disfigurement, functional loss, social isolation | Very common; screening essential; refer to clinical psychology |
| **Body image disturbance** | Loss of facial integrity, permanent stoma, scarring | Especially after extensive resections; compounded by weight loss |
| **Social isolation** | Difficulty speaking → social withdrawal; permanent tracheostomy → stigmatisation [2]; eating difficulties → cannot socialise over meals | |

### 7. Complications Summary Table

| Source of Complication | Acute | Late/Chronic |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Disease** | Airway obstruction, haemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, dysphagia, cranial nerve palsies | Distant metastasis, second primary tumours (field cancerization) |
| **Surgery** | Haematoma (airway emergency), flap failure, wound infection, nerve injury (CN VII, XI, XII, RLN, marginal mandibular), chylous fistula, pharyngocutaneous fistula | Frey syndrome, shoulder syndrome (CN XI), trismus, speech/swallowing impairment, endocrine dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), permanent tracheostomy, stricture |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Disease complications**: Airway obstruction (always protect the airway!), aspiration pneumonia, haemorrhage (carotid blow-out is catastrophic), cranial nerve palsies (NPC), distant metastasis, second primary tumours (field cancerization).

**Surgical complications**:
- Total laryngectomy: loss of speech, loss of cough effort, swallowing dysfunction (neopharyngeal stricture), endocrine dysfunction (hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism), permanent tracheostomy stigmatisation, pharyngocutaneous fistula.
- Partial laryngectomy: aspiration pneumonia, laryngocutaneous fistula, swallowing difficulty.
- Neck dissection: CN XI injury (shoulder drop), chylous fistula (thoracic duct injury), marginal mandibular nerve injury.
- Parotid surgery: CN VII injury, Frey syndrome (aberrant parasympathetic regeneration → gustatory sweating).
