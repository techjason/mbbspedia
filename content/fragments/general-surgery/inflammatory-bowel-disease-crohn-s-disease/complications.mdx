## Complications of Crohn's Disease

Understanding the complications of CD flows directly from understanding the pathology: **transmural inflammation** of a **chronic, relapsing** disease that can affect **any part of the GI tract**. Almost every complication can be traced back to one of these three features. Let's work through them systematically.

The complications can be organised into:
1. **Luminal/structural complications** (direct consequences of transmural inflammation)
2. **Perianal complications**
3. **Metabolic/nutritional complications** (consequences of malabsorption)
4. **Malignant complications**
5. **Extraintestinal manifestations** (immune-mediated complications beyond the gut)
6. **Treatment-related complications**
7. **Post-surgical complications**

### I. Luminal / Structural Complications

These are the hallmarks of CD that distinguish it from UC. They all stem from the **transmural** (full-thickness) nature of CD inflammation.

#### 1. Fistula Formation

***Fistulas are communication that connect two epithelial-lined organs*** [2].

**Pathophysiology** — explained from first principles [2]:
1. ***Transmural inflammation leads to development of sinus tract*** — the inflammation erodes through the mucosa → submucosa → muscularis → serosa
2. ***Sinus tract that penetrates the serosa gives rise to fistulas*** — once the inflammation breaches the outer wall of the bowel, it can track to any adjacent structure
3. The sinus tract becomes epithelialised over time (lined by epithelium), which is why fistulae don't heal spontaneously — you can't easily close a tube that has its own lining

***Types of fistula and their clinical presentations*** [2]:

| Fistula Type | Structures Connected | Clinical Presentation | Why These Symptoms? |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Enteroenteric*** | Bowel loop → bowel loop | ***Palpable mass***; diarrhoea (bypass of absorptive surface) | Inflammatory mass from adherent loops; short-circuiting of intestinal contents |
| ***Enterovesical*** | Bowel → bladder | ***Urinary symptoms due to UTI***; **pneumaturia** (air in urine); **faecaluria** (faeces in urine) | Bowel contents (gas, bacteria, faecal material) enter the bladder → recurrent polymicrobial UTIs, air bubbles in urine |
| ***Enterovaginal*** | Bowel → vagina | ***Passage of gas or faeces through vagina*** | Bowel contents exit via vagina; extremely distressing for patients |
| ***Enterocutaneous*** | Bowel → skin surface | ***Drainage of bowel contents to surface of skin*** | Visible fistula opening on abdominal wall with faeculent/bilious output |
| ***Retroperitoneal*** | Bowel → retroperitoneum | ***Psoas abscess or ureteral obstruction with hydronephrosis*** | Inflammatory/infectious material tracks into retroperitoneal space → can compress the ureter or form abscess in the psoas muscle |

***Enterocutaneous fistula*** [4][20]:

***Causes: FRIEND*** [4] — **F**oreign body, **R**adiation, **I**nflammation/infection, **E**pithelialization, **N**eoplasm, **D**istal obstruction.

Management follows the ***SNAP principle*** [2][20]:
- ***S — Sepsis control***: ***Abscess drainage, antibiotics*** [20]
- ***N — Nutrition support***: ***High vs low output; Nutritional assessment and support*** [20]
- ***A — Anatomy***: ***CTE or MRE*** to delineate [20]
- ***P — Procedure***: ***Medication adjustment; Closure with biological agents; En-bloc resection of involved bowel and fistula*** [20]

<Callout title="High vs Low Output Fistula">
A **high-output fistula** ( > 500 mL/day) is more likely to be proximal (jejunal) and causes severe dehydration, electrolyte disturbances (hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, metabolic acidosis), and malnutrition. A **low-output fistula** ( < 200 mL/day) is more likely to be distal (ileal/colonic) and is more likely to close spontaneously. Output guides the intensity of fluid/electrolyte replacement and nutritional support.
</Callout>

#### 2. Abscess Formation

***Some sinus tracts may lead to abscess formation and present as acute localised peritonitis with fever, abdominal pain and tenderness*** [2].

**Pathophysiology**: Transmural inflammation breaches the serosa → a sinus tract develops → if the sinus is walled off by adjacent structures (omentum, mesentery, other bowel loops) instead of forming a free perforation, a **contained collection of pus** forms = abscess.

**Types by location:**
- **Intra-abdominal** (mesenteric, inter-loop, pelvic, subphrenic)
- **Retroperitoneal** (psoas abscess — a classic CD complication; presents with hip pain, flexion deformity of the hip, and swinging fever)
- **Perianal** (see below)

**Clinical features:**
- Persistent fever (especially swinging/spiking pyrexia) despite antibiotics
- No improvement in abdominal pain despite antibiotics
- Localised tenderness, palpable mass
- Leucocytosis, elevated CRP

**Management**: CT-guided percutaneous drainage + antibiotics. Surgical drainage if percutaneous drainage fails or is not feasible. Must drain abscess before starting biologics (undrained sepsis + immunosuppression = catastrophe).

***Abscess perforation can lead to diffuse peritonitis*** [2] — a surgical emergency.

---

#### 3. Phlegmon Formation

***Some sinus tracts may present as a phlegmon*** [2].

- ***Phlegmon is a walled-off inflammatory mass without bacterial infection*** [2] — think of it as an organised collection of inflamed, adherent bowel loops and mesentery, but without frank pus
- ***Phlegmon may be palpable on abdominal examination*** [2]
- ***Ileal involvement is suggested by a mass in the RLQ*** [2]
- Differentiated from abscess on CT: phlegmon = solid inflammatory mass without a fluid collection; abscess = rim-enhancing fluid collection
- Management: often responds to medical therapy (steroids, biologics); surgery may be needed if it doesn't resolve

---

#### 4. Stricture and Intestinal Obstruction

***Strictures are common in CD*** [1] — they are listed as a key surgical complication [12].

**Pathophysiology**: Chronic transmural inflammation → fibrosis (replacement of normal tissue with collagen) → progressive luminal narrowing → **intestinal obstruction**. This is the natural progression of untreated or under-treated CD.

**Two types of strictures — this distinction is CRITICAL for management:**

| Type | Mechanism | MRE Findings | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Inflammatory stricture*** | Active inflammation causing oedema and narrowing | Wall enhancement, T2 hyperintensity (oedema), restricted diffusion | ***Medical therapy*** [15] — anti-inflammatory drugs can reverse the oedema |
| ***Fibrostenotic stricture*** | Chronic fibrosis causing fixed narrowing | No enhancement, T2 hypointensity (fibrosis, no oedema) | ***Stricturoplasty preferred; Resection if suspect malignancy or isolated stricture*** [15] — fibrosis does NOT respond to medical therapy |

**Clinical features of obstruction:**
- Colicky abdominal pain (waves of peristalsis against the obstruction)
- Abdominal distension
- Vomiting (bilious if distal to ampulla; faeculent if distal SBO)
- Obstipation (complete obstruction) or reduced stool/flatus (partial)
- High-pitched/tinkling bowel sounds → later absent bowel sounds

**Important points:**
- ***NO role for stricturoplasty in Crohn's colitis since there is a 7% risk of malignancy over 20 years*** [2]
- ***Bypass is NOT recommended since there is risk of malignant transformation in the bypassed segment*** [2]
- In CD, colonic strictures should be considered **malignant until proven otherwise** (biopsy essential)

---

#### 5. Perforation

**Pathophysiology**: Transmural inflammation can erode completely through the bowel wall → free perforation into the peritoneal cavity → generalised faecal/purulent peritonitis.

**Types:**
- **Free perforation**: Faecal contamination of the peritoneal cavity → generalised peritonitis → surgical emergency
- **Contained perforation**: Walled off by adjacent structures → forms abscess (see above)
- Perforation can also occur **secondary to toxic megacolon** (though this is more common in UC)

**Clinical features:**
- Sudden severe abdominal pain
- Peritonism: board-like rigidity, rebound tenderness, guarding
- Absent bowel sounds
- Tachycardia, hypotension, fever → septic shock
- CXR: **pneumoperitoneum** (free air under diaphragm) — though this may be absent in contained perforations

**Management**: Emergency laparotomy, resection of perforated segment, often with temporary stoma (anastomosis in the presence of peritoneal contamination is risky due to high leak rates).

---

#### 6. ***Severe Bleeding*** [2]

- Massive GI haemorrhage occurs but is less common than in UC or diverticular disease
- Arises from erosion of transmural inflammation into blood vessels in the bowel wall
- Management: resuscitation → endoscopic haemostasis if possible → angiographic embolisation → surgical resection of the bleeding segment if all else fails
- Listed as a surgical indication: ***Severe bleeding*** [2]

---

#### 7. Toxic Megacolon

***Toxic megacolon is defined as total or segmental non-obstructive dilatation of colon ≥ 6 cm or caecum > 9 cm and the presence of systemic toxicity*** [2].

- More commonly associated with UC, but can occur in Crohn's colitis
- **Pathophysiology**: Severe transmural inflammation destroys the muscularis propria and neural plexus → loss of colonic tone → massive dilatation. The inflamed, thinned wall is at imminent risk of perforation.
- ***Presents with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, anaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and mental changes*** [2]
- ***Diagnosis is made by plain AXR*** [2]
- ***Management: bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition, fluid and electrolyte replacement and corticosteroids*** [2]. If no response within 24-48 hours → emergency surgery (total colectomy + end ileostomy)
- ***Fulminant colitis*** and ***impending perforation: thumb-printing sign*** on AXR are surgical emergencies [4]

---

### II. Perianal Complications

***Perianal diseases are common in CD, occurring in up to 40% of patients*** [1]. ***24.5% of patients with Crohn's disease have perianal disease*** and ***83% required surgery*** [11].

| Perianal Complication | Description | Pathophysiology |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Perianal abscess** | Acute, tender, fluctuant, erythematous swelling adjacent to the anus | Transmural inflammation of the rectum → tracks through the anorectal spaces → bacterial infection → pus collection |
| **Perianal fistula** | ***More complicated courses of fistula tract*** [11]; persistent purulent or faeculent discharge from an external opening near the anus | An abscess that drains spontaneously or is surgically drained → the track persists and epithelialises → chronic fistula |
| **Anal fissure** | Painful linear tear in the anal canal; classically lateral in CD (vs posterior midline in idiopathic) | Transmural inflammation of the anoderm; NOT from mechanical tearing |
| **Skin tags** | Large, oedematous, "elephant ear" perianal skin tags | Chronic lymphoedema from obstructed lymphatic drainage in inflamed perianal tissue; virtually pathognomonic of CD |
| **Anorectal stricture** | Narrowing of the anal canal/rectum causing difficulty with defecation | Chronic perianal inflammation → fibrosis → stricture |

***MRI and EAUS are necessary to document before the definitive treatment*** [11] — because the anatomy of perianal fistulae is complex (relationship to sphincter muscles) and determines the surgical approach.

Management: ***Anti-TNF ± AZA and/or seton drainage*** [11] (see Management section for full algorithm).

---

### III. Metabolic and Nutritional Complications

These arise primarily from **terminal ileal disease or resection** and **chronic inflammation-driven malabsorption**.

#### A. Malabsorption-Related

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Vitamin B12 deficiency** | Terminal ileum is the **sole** site of B12 absorption → ileal disease or resection → no B12 uptake | ***Megaloblastic anaemia, peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord*** [2]; glossitis |
| **Iron deficiency anaemia** | Chronic GI blood loss + impaired iron absorption (duodenal/jejunal disease) | Microcytic hypochromic anaemia; fatigue, pallor, koilonychia, angular stomatitis |
| **Anaemia of chronic disease** | Chronic inflammation → hepcidin production by liver → hepcidin blocks ferroportin on enterocytes and macrophages → iron sequestration → reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis | Normocytic normochromic anaemia (or microcytic); low serum iron, normal/high ferritin |
| **Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, K)** | Bile salt malabsorption (terminal ileal disease) → impaired fat absorption → fat-soluble vitamins not absorbed | Vitamin D: osteomalacia, osteoporosis; Vitamin K: coagulopathy (prolonged PT/INR); Vitamin A: night blindness; Vitamin E: neuropathy |
| **Steatorrhoea** | ***Bile acid malabsorption due to inflamed or resected terminal ileum; bacterial overgrowth from small bowel strictures and enterocolonic fistula*** [2] | ***Pale, greasy, smelly and bulky stool that floats on water and difficult to flush*** [2] |

#### B. ***Gallstones (Cholelithiasis)*** [2]

***Altered bile composition since resection of the ileum interrupts the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids and causes bile to be supersaturated with cholesterol*** [21].

**Step-by-step pathophysiology:**
1. Normal: bile salts are absorbed in the terminal ileum → return to the liver via portal circulation (enterohepatic circulation) → re-secreted into bile
2. Terminal ileal disease/resection → bile salt malabsorption → depleted bile salt pool
3. Bile becomes supersaturated with cholesterol (normally, bile salts keep cholesterol in solution)
4. Cholesterol precipitates → **cholesterol gallstones**
5. Additionally: reduced oral intake / TPN → bile stasis → further promotes stone formation [21]

#### C. ***Kidney Stones (Nephrolithiasis — Calcium Oxalate)*** [2]

***Increased risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis*** [21].

**Step-by-step pathophysiology [21]:**
1. Normal: dietary calcium binds dietary oxalate in the gut lumen → insoluble calcium oxalate complex → excreted in stool (never absorbed)
2. In CD with fat malabsorption: unabsorbed fatty acids preferentially bind calcium in the gut lumen → **calcium is unavailable to bind oxalate**
3. Free oxalate remains in the gut lumen → absorbed in the colon → enters the bloodstream → filtered by kidneys → **hyperoxaluria**
4. ***Calcium binds to unabsorbed fatty acids leaving oxalate free to pass into the colon to be absorbed and then filtered by the kidneys*** [21]
5. In the renal tubules: oxalate + urinary calcium → **calcium oxalate kidney stones**

**Prevention [21]:**
- ***Increased fluid intake***
- ***Low oxalate diet***
- ***Correction of metabolic acidosis with potassium citrate*** (citrate inhibits calcium oxalate crystallisation)

#### D. ***Metabolic Bone Disease*** [21]

***Primary due to malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D, both of which are consequences of fat malabsorption*** [21].

- Also contributed to by corticosteroid use (steroids → osteoblast apoptosis, reduced calcium absorption, increased renal calcium excretion)
- ***Increased risk for osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis and secondary hyperparathyroidism*** [21]
  - Osteomalacia = defective mineralisation of osteoid (soft bones)
  - Osteoporosis = reduced bone mass
  - Secondary hyperparathyroidism: low calcium → PTH secretion → bone resorption to maintain serum calcium
- ***Managed with magnesium, calcium and vitamin D supplements*** [21]
- DEXA scan for bone density monitoring

#### E. Short Bowel Syndrome

This is a complication of **treatment** rather than the disease itself — ***repeated bowel resections can lead to short gut syndrome*** [2].

- Defined as < 200 cm of remaining small bowel (or < 100 cm without colon)
- Loss of absorptive surface → global malabsorption → dependence on TPN
- Complications of short bowel syndrome include [21]: electrolyte deficiency (hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia), trace element deficiency (zinc, copper, selenium), iron deficiency, essential fatty acid deficiency, metabolic bone disease, gallstones, kidney stones, oesophagitis/PUD (gastrin hypersecretion), TPN-associated complications (line infections, liver disease)
- This is precisely why ***surgical principle = preservation of bowel length*** [4] and ***conservative and minimum resection*** [12] are emphasised

---

### IV. Malignant Complications

#### ***Colorectal Cancer (CRC)*** [2]

***CRC in IBD patients is preceded by dysplasia. Incidence of CRC in IBD: 18% after 30 years of colitis*** [22].

**Pathophysiology**: The dysplasia-carcinoma sequence in IBD differs from the sporadic adenoma-carcinoma sequence:
- **Sporadic CRC**: Normal mucosa → adenoma → carcinoma (discrete polyp)
- **IBD-CRC**: Chronic inflammation → flat dysplasia (not a polyp) → carcinoma. The chronic inflammatory milieu generates reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and promotes clonal expansion of dysplastic cells across a wide field ("field cancerisation")

***Risk factors for IBD-associated colorectal neoplasia*** [18]:

| Category | Risk Factors |
|:---|:---|
| ***Patient-specific*** | ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis; History of colorectal neoplasia; Family history of CRC in first-degree relative; Smoking; Early age of disease onset; Male sex*** [18] |
| ***Disease-specific*** | ***Disease duration; Disease extent; Cumulative inflammatory burden; Active inflammation endoscopically or histologically*** [18] |
| ***Endoscopic features*** | ***Stricture (UC, longer disease duration, proximal location, symptoms); Shortened tubular colon; Pseudopolyps*** [18] |

**CRC Surveillance** [23]:

***AGA guideline 2010*** [23]:
- ***Started at a maximum 8 years after UC or Crohn's colitis***
- ***Optimal surveillance interval not clearly defined***
- ***Left-sided or extensive colitis: within 1-2 years after initial screening colonoscopy***
- ***After two negative examinations, every 1 to 3 years***
- ***Individualised (i.e. presence of other risk factors)***
- ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis: yearly***
- ***Ulcerative proctitis: not considered at increased risk***
- ***Ideally, surveillance colonoscopy should be performed when the disease is in remission***

**Surveillance methods** [2]:
- **Chromoendoscopy** — highest yield for dysplasia detection; involves topical application of methylene blue or indigo carmine to enhance mucosal irregularities
- **High-definition white light colonoscopy** — alternative when chromoendoscopy yield is decreased
- **Narrow band imaging (NBI)** — does NOT enhance dysplasia detection [2]

#### Small Bowel Malignancy

- CD patients have a modestly increased risk of **small bowel adenocarcinoma**, especially in chronically inflamed segments
- Also increased risk of **small bowel lymphoma** (particularly with immunosuppressive therapy)
- The risk is lower than CRC risk but is important because small bowel cancers are difficult to detect early

---

### V. Extraintestinal Complications

These are immune-mediated manifestations occurring **outside the GI tract**. They were discussed in detail in the Clinical Features section but are also true complications of CD.

***Extraintestinal manifestations*** [2][1]:

| System | Complications | Key Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***Vascular*** | ***Arterial and venous thromboembolism (portal and mesenteric thrombosis / DVT)*** [2] | IBD patients have a 2-3× increased risk of VTE. Mechanism: chronic inflammation → endothelial activation, upregulation of tissue factor, platelet activation, hyperfibrinogenaemia. VTE can occur during flares AND in remission. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered during hospital admissions. |
| ***Hepatobiliary*** | ***Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); Fatty liver; Autoimmune liver disease*** [2] | PSC is more associated with UC but can occur in CD colitis. PSC independently increases CRC risk and is an indication for annual surveillance. |
| ***Gastrointestinal*** | ***Colorectal cancer*** [2] | See above |
| ***Ocular*** | ***Uveitis; Episcleritis; Scleritis; Iritis; Conjunctivitis*** [2] | Episcleritis correlates with disease activity; anterior uveitis may be independent. All patients with eye symptoms need urgent ophthalmology review. |
| ***Urogenital*** | ***Renal stones*** [2] | Calcium oxalate stones (mechanism above); also uric acid stones (from dehydration/diarrhoea → concentrated urine) |
| ***Haematology*** | ***Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia*** [2] | Rare; warm autoantibodies against RBCs; may be drug-related (sulfasalazine) |
| ***Endocrine*** | ***Vitamin B12 deficiency*** [2] | Terminal ileal disease/resection (mechanism above) |
| ***Dermatological*** | ***Erythema nodosum (more common); Pyoderma gangrenosum*** [2] | EN correlates with disease activity; PG is independent. PG can also occur at stoma sites (peristomal pyoderma gangrenosum). |
| ***Musculoskeletal*** | ***Arthritis; Ankylosing spondylitis; Osteoporosis; Osteomalacia*** [2] | Peripheral arthropathy (Type 1 large joint, correlates with activity; Type 2 small joint, independent). AS is HLA-B27 associated and independent of activity. Osteoporosis from malabsorption + steroids. |

<Callout title="VTE in IBD — Often Forgotten" type="error">
Students often forget that IBD patients have a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (DVT, PE, portal vein thrombosis). This is one of the most dangerous complications. All hospitalised IBD patients should receive VTE prophylaxis (LMWH) unless actively bleeding. IBD is an independent risk factor for VTE even in young patients.
</Callout>

### VI. Treatment-Related Complications

The therapies we use for CD carry their own complications — an unavoidable trade-off:

| Treatment | Key Complications | Mechanism |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Corticosteroids** (long-term) | Osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, adrenal suppression, avascular necrosis, Cushing's, growth retardation (paediatric) | Steroids suppress osteoblasts, promote insulin resistance, cause posterior subcapsular cataracts, suppress the HPA axis |
| **Thiopurines (AZA/6-MP)** | Myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, lymphoma (especially hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma), increased infections | Myelosuppression from 6-TGN accumulation; pancreatitis is idiosyncratic; lymphoma from chronic immunosuppression |
| **Methotrexate** | Hepatotoxicity, pneumonitis, myelosuppression, teratogenicity | Folate antagonism; cumulative hepatotoxicity → fibrosis |
| **Anti-TNF agents** | TB reactivation, HBV reactivation, lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancer, infusion reactions, demyelination, heart failure exacerbation | TNF-α blockade removes TB containment, removes anti-tumour surveillance, triggers autoimmune demyelination in susceptible individuals |
| **Vedolizumab** | PML (theoretical, extremely rare — unlike natalizumab which targets α4 integrin non-selectively) | Vedolizumab is gut-selective (α4β7) so PML risk is essentially nil, unlike natalizumab (α4β1 in brain) |
| **Thiopurine + Anti-TNF combination** | Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) — rare but almost always fatal, particularly in young males | Dual immunosuppression → profound T-cell suppression → γδ T-cell lymphoproliferation |

---

### VII. Post-Surgical Complications

#### A. Post-Resection Recurrence

- **The most important long-term surgical complication**: CD recurs in ~70-80% at the neo-terminal ileum within 1 year of surgery (endoscopic recurrence), and ~50% will have clinical recurrence within 5 years without prophylaxis
- **Why at the neo-terminal ileum?** After ileocaecal resection, the new "terminal ileum" (the anastomotic site) is exposed to the faecal stream and bacterial load — the same factors that drive disease in the original terminal ileum
- Assessed by **colonoscopy at 6-12 months post-op** using the **Rutgeerts score** (i0-i4 grading of endoscopic recurrence at the anastomosis)
- Prevented by post-operative prophylaxis (AZA, anti-TNF) and **smoking cessation** (smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor for post-surgical recurrence)

#### B. Short Bowel Syndrome (Discussed Above)

***Repeated bowel resections can lead to short gut syndrome*** [2] — hence the emphasis on ***conservative and minimum resection*** [12] and ***preservation of bowel length*** [4].

#### C. Anastomotic Complications

- **Anastomotic leak**: Leakage at the surgical join → peritonitis, sepsis. Risk increased by malnutrition, steroids, and active disease at the resection margin.
- **Anastomotic stricture**: Fibrosis at the anastomotic site → narrowing → obstruction. Can be managed with endoscopic balloon dilatation.

#### D. Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction

- Any abdominal surgery → adhesion formation → bands of fibrous tissue can kink or compress bowel → mechanical obstruction
- ***Laparoscopic ileocaecal resection*** reduces adhesion formation compared to open surgery → ***reduction of adhesive bowel obstruction*** [13]

#### E. Stoma-Related Complications [21]

If a stoma is created (ileostomy or colostomy), potential complications include:

| Timing | Complication | Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Early | Ischaemia/necrosis, retraction, peristomal abscess, high output (ileostomy) | High output → dehydration, electrolyte disturbances |
| Intermediate | Dermatitis (effluent irritation), granuloma, stenosis, fistula | ***Fistula: usually ileostomy, especially Crohn's disease*** [21] — CD can recur at the stoma site |
| Late | Parastomal hernia, prolapse | Parastomal hernia is the most common late complication |

---

### VIII. Complications Specific to Disease Behaviour

Pulling it all together according to the ***Montreal classification*** [1]:

| Behaviour | Complications | Why |
|:---|:---|:---|
| ***B1 (Inflammatory, 65.2%)*** | Malnutrition, anaemia, EIMs; may progress to B2 or B3 over time | Active inflammation causes systemic effects; ~50% of B1 patients will develop B2 or B3 within 20 years |
| ***B2 (Stricturing, 25.1%)*** | ***Intestinal obstruction***, bacterial overgrowth proximal to stricture, short bowel syndrome (if multiple resections) | Fibrosis narrows the lumen; stagnant bowel proximal to stricture allows bacterial overgrowth |
| ***B3 (Penetrating, 16.1%)*** | ***Fistulae, abscesses, perforation*** | Transmural inflammation breaches the serosa |
| ***P (Perianal, 24.5%)*** | Perianal abscess, fistula, stricture, incontinence | Transmural rectal inflammation extends into perianal tissues |

<Callout title="Disease Behaviour Progresses Over Time">
CD does not stay in one category. A patient initially classified as B1 (inflammatory) may progress to B2 (stricturing) or B3 (penetrating) over time as chronic inflammation leads to fibrosis or transmural damage. This is the rationale for the "top-down" or early aggressive treatment approach — by achieving deep remission early, you may prevent the irreversible structural complications (strictures, fistulae) from developing in the first place.
</Callout>

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Crohn's Disease">

**Luminal complications (all from transmural inflammation):**
- ***Fistulae***: Enteroenteric (mass), enterovesical (pneumaturia, UTI), enterovaginal (faecal vaginal discharge), enterocutaneous (skin drainage), retroperitoneal (psoas abscess). SNAP management.
- ***Abscesses***: Intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, perianal. CT-guided drainage + antibiotics. Must drain BEFORE biologics.
- ***Strictures***: Inflammatory (medical Rx) vs fibrostenotic (stricturoplasty/resection). No stricturoplasty in colon (7% malignancy risk). No bypass (malignant transformation risk).
- ***Perforation***: Free → peritonitis → emergency surgery. Contained → abscess.
- ***Toxic megacolon***: Colon ≥ 6 cm + systemic toxicity. Diagnosed by AXR. Medical → if fails → emergency colectomy.

**Perianal**: Up to 40%; 83% need surgery. MRI essential. Anti-TNF ± AZA ± seton.

**Metabolic/nutritional**: B12 deficiency (terminal ileal), iron deficiency, fat-soluble vitamins, gallstones (bile salt malabsorption → cholesterol supersaturation), kidney stones (hyperoxaluria), metabolic bone disease (vitamin D + steroids), short bowel syndrome.

**Malignancy**: CRC (18% at 30 years of colitis; preceded by dysplasia; surveillance from 8 years). Risk factors: PSC, disease duration/extent, active inflammation, family history.

**EIMs**: VTE (2-3× risk — prophylaxis in hospital), PSC, uveitis, erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, arthritis/AS, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia.

**Treatment-related**: Steroid toxicity (osteoporosis, diabetes); thiopurine (myelosuppression, HSTCL); anti-TNF (TB/HBV reactivation, lymphoma).

**Post-surgical**: Recurrence (70-80% at 1 year without prophylaxis), short bowel syndrome, anastomotic leak/stricture, adhesive SBO, stoma complications.

      question: "A CD patient presents with recurrent UTIs and pneumaturia. What type of fistula is this, and what is the step-by-step pathophysiology of its formation?",
      markscheme: "Enterovesical fistula (bowel to bladder). Pathophysiology: Transmural inflammation erodes through all bowel wall layers developing a sinus tract. The sinus tract penetrates the serosa and tracks to the adjacent bladder. Communication forms between bowel and bladder lumen. Bowel contents (gas, bacteria, faeces) enter the bladder causing pneumaturia (air in urine), faecaluria, and recurrent polymicrobial UTIs."

    {
      question: "Explain the pathophysiology of calcium oxalate kidney stones in a patient with terminal ileal Crohn's disease.",
      markscheme: "Normally, dietary calcium binds dietary oxalate in the gut lumen forming insoluble calcium oxalate complex excreted in stool. In CD with terminal ileal disease, bile salt malabsorption leads to fat malabsorption. Unabsorbed fatty acids bind calcium preferentially, leaving free oxalate in the gut lumen. Free oxalate is absorbed in the colon, enters the bloodstream, filtered by kidneys causing hyperoxaluria. Oxalate combines with urinary calcium forming calcium oxalate kidney stones."

    {
      question: "Why is short bowel syndrome a major concern in CD management, and what surgical principles are used to prevent it?",
      markscheme: "CD is not curable by surgery and recurs after resection. Repeated resections progressively shorten the small bowel. Short bowel syndrome occurs when less than 200cm of small bowel remains, causing global malabsorption and TPN dependence. Prevention: preservation of bowel length (document residual SB length), conservative and minimum resection, stricturoplasty preferred over resection where possible, extended resection does not decrease recurrence."

Disease-specific: disease duration, extent, cumulative inflammatory burden, active inflammation. Endoscopic: stricture, shortened tubular colon, pseudopolyps. Surveillance begins at maximum 8 years after UC or Crohn's colitis (AGA 2010), repeated every 1-3 years. PSC patients require yearly surveillance."

      markscheme: "Diagnosis: Intra-abdominal abscess. Immediate management: CT-guided percutaneous drainage plus IV antibiotics. Must drain abscess before continuing biologics because anti-TNF therapy causes immunosuppression. Undrained sepsis combined with immunosuppression leads to uncontrolled infection and septic shock. Only after sepsis is controlled can biologics be safely continued or restarted."

    {
      question: "Compare inflammatory versus fibrostenotic strictures in CD: how do they differ on MRE and in management?",
      markscheme: "Inflammatory stricture: MRE shows wall enhancement (gadolinium uptake indicates active inflammation), T2 hyperintensity (oedema), restricted diffusion. Management: medical therapy (steroids, biologics) as inflammation is reversible. Fibrostenotic stricture: MRE shows no enhancement, T2 hypointensity (fibrosis). Management: endoscopic balloon dilatation, stricturoplasty (small bowel), or resection (large bowel or suspected malignancy). Fibrosis does not respond to anti-inflammatory drugs."
