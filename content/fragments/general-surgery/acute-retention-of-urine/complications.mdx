## Complications of Acute Retention of Urine

Complications of AROU can be broadly divided into three categories:

1. **Complications of AROU itself** (the disease) — what happens to the urinary tract while it remains obstructed
2. **Complications of decompression** (the treatment) — what happens when you relieve the obstruction
3. **Complications of long-term catheterisation** — what happens if the patient needs prolonged drainage

Let's work through each systematically, always explaining *why* from first principles.

---

### 1. Complications of AROU Itself (The Disease)

These are the consequences of a persistently obstructed urinary tract. They progress from the bladder level upwards to the kidneys, and the longer the obstruction persists, the more severe the damage.

Think of it as a "rising tide" of back-pressure — obstruction at the bladder outlet causes pressure to build in the bladder, then the ureters, then the kidneys.

#### 1.1 Bladder-Level Complications

##### A. Detrusor Injury from Overdistension

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | When the bladder is acutely distended, the detrusor smooth muscle fibres are stretched beyond their optimal length on the length-tension curve → reduced actin-myosin overlap → ***ineffective detrusor contraction*** [4]. This is analogous to an overstretched elastic band that loses its snap. |
| **Consequence** | Even after the obstruction is relieved, the detrusor may remain weak (temporary or permanent). This is why some patients fail TWOC — it's not just the prostate, it's a damaged detrusor that can no longer generate adequate pressure. |
| **Reversibility** | If the overdistension was brief (hours), recovery is likely. If prolonged (days–weeks, especially in unrecognised CROU), the damage may be irreversible with permanent detrusor decompensation. |

##### B. Recurrent UTI

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Stagnant urine in the bladder is an excellent culture medium for bacteria. Normally, regular voiding "washes out" bacteria (mechanical clearance). In retention, urine sits for hours → bacterial proliferation → ***recurrent UTI*** [1][2][4] |
| **Relevance** | UTI is both a **complication** of retention AND a **precipitant** of retention (urethral oedema + pain → reflex inhibition of voiding). This creates a vicious cycle. |
| **Clinical features** | Fever, dysuria, cloudy/malodorous urine, worsening LUTS [3] |

***Recurrent UTI*** is listed as a ***consequence of BOO*** on the lecture slides [1].

##### C. Bladder Stones (Vesical Calculi)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Stagnant urine → urinary stasis → supersaturation of solutes → crystal nucleation and stone formation. Additionally, chronic infection (especially with urea-splitting organisms like *Proteus mirabilis*) → alkaline urine → ***struvite stone*** (magnesium ammonium phosphate) formation |
| **Clinical features** | Strangury (painful, frequent voiding of small volumes), intermittent stream (stone acts as a ball-valve at the bladder neck), worsening irritative LUTS, recurrent UTI |

***Formation of bladder calculi*** is specifically listed on the lecture slides [1].

##### D. Bladder Diverticulum

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic obstruction → the detrusor hypertrophies to push urine past the obstruction → eventually, the mucosa herniates through weak points between the hypertrophied muscle bundles → outpouchings (diverticula). These diverticula have **no muscle wall** → they cannot empty → urine stagnates → further UTI and stone formation |
| **Clinical features** | Usually asymptomatic unless complicated by infection, stones, or rarely, malignancy within the diverticulum |

##### E. Bladder Wall Changes (Trabeculation)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Detrusor muscle hypertrophies in response to chronic increased outflow resistance (just as the left ventricle hypertrophies in aortic stenosis). The hypertrophied muscle bundles create a trabeculated (ridged) bladder wall visible on cystoscopy |
| **Significance** | Indicates chronic obstruction; the trabeculated bladder is often associated with secondary detrusor overactivity (involuntary contractions during filling → irritative LUTS) |

#### 1.2 Upper Tract Complications

##### F. Hydroureter and Hydronephrosis

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Back-pressure from the distended bladder transmits up the ureters → ureteric dilatation (hydroureter) → dilatation of the renal pelvis and calyces (hydronephrosis). For this to occur bilaterally (and thus threaten renal function), the obstruction must be at or below the bladder outlet — which is exactly where it is in AROU |
| **Clinical features** | Often silent initially; may present with loin pain (distension of the renal capsule), or be detected on USG KUB as part of the AROU workup |

***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis*** is specifically listed on the lecture slides as a ***consequence of BOO*** [1].

##### G. Obstructive Uropathy / Renal Impairment / Acute Renal Failure

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Prolonged hydronephrosis → ↑ pressure in the renal pelvis → opposes glomerular filtration pressure → ↓ GFR → ***post-renal AKI***. Additionally, parenchymal compression → tubular ischaemia → if prolonged, ***tubulointerstitial fibrosis*** and irreversible renal damage [7] |
| **Why bilateral?** | For post-renal AKI to occur, the obstruction must affect **both kidneys** (or the only functioning kidney). In AROU, the obstruction is at the bladder outlet, which is distal to both ureteric orifices — so it always affects both kidneys [7] |
| **Clinical features** | ↑ Creatinine, ↑ urea, ↑ K⁺ on bloods; oliguria (despite a full bladder); uraemic symptoms (nausea, lethargy, confusion, pruritus, sallow complexion) in severe cases [3] |
| **Reversibility** | If recognised and relieved early (catheterisation), renal function usually recovers. If prolonged, permanent nephron loss occurs — ***prolonged post-renal disease will progress to become tubulointerstitial fibrosis, i.e. intrinsic renal disease*** [7] |

***Renal impairment / ARF (Obstructive uropathy)*** is specifically listed on the lecture slides [1].

<Callout title="Key Concept: Why Post-Renal AKI is Reversible (If Caught Early)">
The kidney is unique in that its filtration is driven by hydrostatic pressure gradients. Post-renal obstruction simply opposes this gradient. Once you relieve the obstruction (catheterise the patient), the pressure gradient is restored and filtration resumes. This is why ***recognising pre- and post-renal disease is particularly important because these are often rapidly reversible compared to renal intrinsic disease*** [7]. But if you leave the obstruction too long, the tubules undergo ischaemic injury and fibrosis — then the damage becomes intrinsic and irreversible.

#### 1.3 Complications of Chronic BOO (If AROU Represents Decompensation of Chronic Disease)

Many AROU patients have had **chronic** BOO (e.g. longstanding BPH) that has now acutely decompensated. In these patients, additional complications may already be present [2][4]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Overflow incontinence*** | ***Superimposed in CROU with ↑↑ PVR in bladder*** [2] — bladder pressure exceeds urethral resistance → constant dribbling. Patient appears "incontinent" but is actually in retention |
| ***Hernia*** | ***Chronic straining*** to void against obstruction → ↑ intra-abdominal pressure → inguinal or umbilical hernia [2] |
| ***Haematuria*** | ***Ruptured dilated bladder veins at the base*** (significant BPH → ↑ blood flow) [2] |

**Summary of complications as presented on the lecture slides** [1]:

> ***Consequence of BOO:***
> - ***Retention of urine — acute or chronic***
> - ***Recurrent UTI***
> - ***Formation of bladder calculi***
> - ***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis***
> - ***Renal impairment / ARF (Obstructive uropathy)***

### 2. Complications of Decompression (The Treatment)

These are iatrogenic complications that occur *after* you catheterise the patient and relieve the obstruction. They are important because they are **predictable and preventable** with good monitoring [2][3][4][5].

#### 2.1 Post-Obstructive Diuresis (POD)

This is the **most important complication to know** for exams.

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | ***Diuresis > 200 mL/hr for ≥ 2 hours*** [3][4][5] or > 3 L urine in 24 hours [2][3] that ***persists after decompression of the bladder*** |
| **Mechanism** | ***Tubular damage → ↓ concentrating ability → rapid fluid and solute loss*** [2][3]. During the period of obstruction, the kidneys were unable to excrete accumulated solutes (urea, sodium, water). Once the obstruction is relieved: (a) the osmotic load of accumulated urea drives an osmotic diuresis; (b) damaged tubules cannot reabsorb sodium and water normally; (c) accumulated natriuretic peptides promote salt/water loss |
| **When is it most likely?** | ***Primarily a problem of chronic (not acute) urinary retention*** [4] — because chronic obstruction leads to more solute/fluid accumulation AND more tubular damage |
| **Physiological vs Pathological** | ***Represents a physiological response to remove excess fluid in the body (especially in CROU)*** [2][3] — this is the body correctly offloading fluid that shouldn't be there. It becomes **pathological** when it persists beyond the correction of fluid overload → causing dehydration, hypotension, and electrolyte disturbances |
| **Electrolyte derangements** | ***May have hypoNa, hypoK, hypovolaemia*** [2][3]. Why? Because the damaged tubules lose sodium and potassium in the dilute diuretic fluid |
| **Monitoring** | ***Close monitoring of intake/output (IO), fluid/electrolyte status*** [2][3]. ***Remember to chart urine output Q2h*** [2][3] |
| **Management** | ***Prefer oral hydration; aim to replace ½ (50%) of urine output in the past hour*** [2][3]. If the patient is unable to drink (confused, elderly, NBM), ***isotonic saline replacement is indicated*** [4] |
| **Key rule** | ***Do NOT remove the Foley catheter during post-obstructive diuresis*** — doing so risks re-obstruction, re-distension, and hydronephrosis [4] |

<Callout title="Post-Obstructive Diuresis — The Replacement Trap" type="error">
A common mistake is to replace urine output mL-for-mL with IV fluids. This **perpetuates** the diuresis by maintaining the volume excess that the kidneys are trying to get rid of. The correct approach is to replace **only 50–75%** of the previous hour's urine output. If the diuresis is purely physiological, it will resolve within 24–48 hours once the excess fluid has been cleared. If it persists beyond this, suspect pathological POD and check electrolytes closely [2][3].
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Haemorrhage Ex Vacuo (Transient Haematuria)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | ***Transient haematuria due to mucosal disruption*** [2][3][5] |
| **Mechanism** | ***Bladder mucosal disruption with sudden emptying of a greatly distended bladder*** [2][3]. When the overdistended bladder wall suddenly collapses after drainage, the stretched mucosal vessels shear and bleed. Think of it like a balloon deflating — the sudden change in wall tension damages the delicate mucosal capillaries |
| **Clinical features** | Haematuria in the catheter bag, usually appearing within minutes to hours of catheterisation |
| **Significance** | ***Usually self-limiting, rarely significant*** [2][3] |
| **Management** | Observation; rarely requires intervention. If persistent or forming clots → continuous bladder irrigation with 3-way catheter. If massive → cystoscopic clot evacuation |

#### 2.3 Transient Hypotension

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | ***Vasovagal response or relief of pelvic venous congestion*** [2][3]. Two mechanisms: (a) Vagal stimulation from sudden bladder decompression → bradycardia + vasodilation → hypotension (vasovagal syncope); (b) A grossly distended bladder compresses the pelvic veins → ↑ venous return to the heart. Sudden decompression → release of compression → blood pools in the pelvic veins → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac output → transient hypotension |
| **Management** | Lie patient flat; IV fluids if significant. Some sources recommend gradual decompression (clamping the catheter intermittently every 200–300 mL), though the evidence for this is debated and most modern practice favours complete drainage |

#### 2.4 Urethral Injury and Stricture

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Traumatic catheterisation → false passage through the urethral wall; forceful passage through an unsuspected stricture; balloon inflation in the urethra (not the bladder); repeated catheterisations |
| **Consequence** | Immediate: urethral bleeding, pain, false passage. Late: ***urethral stricture*** (fibrosis at the site of injury) — a common long-term complication of catheterisation [4] |
| **Prevention** | Good technique: adequate lubrication (xylocaine gel), insert catheter fully before inflating balloon, use appropriate catheter size, no-touch technique |

#### 2.5 Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | The catheter is a foreign body in the urinary tract. Bacteria colonise the catheter surface and form a **biofilm** (a structured community of bacteria embedded in an extracellular matrix). This biofilm is resistant to both antibiotics and the immune system. Bacteria migrate along the catheter (extraluminally between catheter and urethral mucosa, or intraluminally through the drainage system) |
| **Risk** | Risk increases ~3–7% per day of catheterisation. By 30 days, almost 100% of patients with indwelling catheters have bacteriuria |
| **Management** | Maintain a closed drainage system; remove the catheter as soon as possible (daily reassessment of need); hand hygiene; avoid unnecessary catheter changes; do NOT treat asymptomatic bacteriuria in catheterised patients (only treat if symptomatic UTI or before urological procedures) |

---

### 3. Complications of Long-Term Catheterisation

If the patient fails TWOC and requires long-term catheter drainage, additional complications emerge [2][3]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***UTI / Urosepsis*** | Biofilm formation on catheter → chronic bacteriuria → episodes of symptomatic UTI; if bacteria enter the bloodstream → sepsis |
| ***Urethral trauma / Erosion*** | Chronic pressure of the catheter against the urethral mucosa → mucosal erosion, especially at the meatus and penoscrotal junction |
| ***Urethral stricture*** | Repeated trauma and inflammation → fibrosis → narrowing [2] |
| ***Bladder stones*** | Catheter acts as a nidus (nucleus) for crystal deposition; also urinary stasis + chronic infection → stone formation |
| ***Prostatitis*** | Foreign body (catheter) passing through the prostatic urethra → bacterial colonisation of prostatic tissue |
| ***Catheter blockage / Encrustation*** | Mineral deposition (calcium phosphate, struvite) on the catheter surface → obstruction to drainage → needs regular catheter changes (every 4–6 weeks for latex, up to 12 weeks for silicone) |
| ***SCC of bladder*** (rare, very long-term) | ***Chronic irritation and inflammation of the bladder mucosa*** → metaplasia → squamous cell carcinoma. This is seen in patients with catheters for **years** (e.g. spinal cord injury patients) [2] |
| ***Loss of bladder capacity*** | Chronic drainage means the bladder is never allowed to fill → the detrusor atrophies and the bladder becomes a small, contracted organ |

> ***Long-term catheterisation is not preferred*** [2][3] because of the above complications. ***Clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC)*** is preferred when feasible: it has ***↑ rate of spontaneous voiding and ↓ complications (renal failure, upper UTI)*** [2][3].

---

### 4. Complications of Specific Surgical Treatments (TURP)

If the patient proceeds to definitive surgery (TURP), there are specific complications to be aware of [2][5]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism / Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Early** | ***Bleeding*** | ***3–7% require transfusion*** [2] |
| **Early** | ***Infection / Urosepsis*** | Instrumentation through colonised urinary tract |
| **Early** | ***TUR syndrome*** | ***Dilutional hyponatremia + fluid overload + glycine toxicity*** from absorption of hypotonic irrigant in monopolar TURP. S/S: ***nausea (first), confusion, cerebral oedema, visual disturbance***. Prevention: ***bipolar TURP (saline irrigant), limit volume < 1 L, pressure < 60 mmHg*** [5] |
| **Early** | ***Perforation*** | ***Can form fistula*** [5] |
| **Early** | ***Incontinence*** | ***1%: urge incontinence (early) / stress incontinence (late)*** [5] |
| **Early/Late** | ***Retrograde ejaculation*** | ***70–80% (most common long-term complication); due to resection of bladder neck*** [5] → incompetent bladder neck → semen flows backwards into bladder during ejaculation |
| **Late** | ***Urethral stricture*** | ***Due to urethral instrumentation*** [5]; 7–8% |
| **Late** | ***Bladder neck stenosis*** | Scarring at the resection site; 7–8% [2] |
| **Late** | ***Erectile dysfunction*** | ***5%*** — uncommon; thought to be related to thermal injury to cavernous nerves |
| **Late** | ***Regrowth of prostate*** | BPH is a progressive disease; ***5% need re-operation in 5 years*** [2] |

### 5. Complications by Temporal Classification

| Timing | Complications |
|---|---|
| **Immediate (during AROU)** | Severe pain, autonomic disturbance (tachycardia, hypertension), post-renal AKI (bilateral hydronephrosis) |
| **After decompression (hours)** | Post-obstructive diuresis, haemorrhage ex vacuo, transient hypotension, urethral injury |
| **Short-term (days–weeks)** | CAUTI, failed TWOC requiring re-catheterisation |
| **Long-term (weeks–months)** | Urethral stricture, recurrent AROU (if underlying cause not addressed), bladder stones, chronic renal impairment |
| **Very long-term (years)** | SCC bladder (from chronic catheterisation), permanent detrusor decompensation, CKD from chronic obstructive uropathy |

---

### 6. Complications of Untreated / Unrecognised AROU

What happens if AROU is not recognised or treated? The progression is relentless [1][4][7]:

```
Bladder outlet obstruction
  → Bladder distension + detrusor injury
    → Ureteric back-pressure → Bilateral hydroureter + hydronephrosis
      → ↓ GFR → Post-renal AKI
        → Uraemia, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis
          → If severe: arrhythmia (from hyperK), pulmonary oedema, uraemic encephalopathy
            → Death (if not relieved)
```

Additionally, stagnant urine → UTI → if bacteraemia develops → **urosepsis** → septic shock → multi-organ failure.

<Callout title="Life-Threatening Complications of AROU" type="error">
The immediately life-threatening complications are:
1. **Hyperkalaemia** from post-renal AKI → cardiac arrhythmia → cardiac arrest
2. **Urosepsis** → septic shock → multi-organ failure
3. **Pulmonary oedema** from fluid overload (kidneys cannot excrete fluid)

These are why AROU is treated as an **emergency** — you don't leave a patient in AROU overnight waiting for the morning ward round. Catheterise immediately.
</Callout>
