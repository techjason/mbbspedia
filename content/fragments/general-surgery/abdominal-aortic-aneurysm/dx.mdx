## Diagnosis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)

### Diagnostic Principles — Thinking from First Principles

Before diving into individual tests, let's understand *what we need from our investigations* and *why*:

1. **Confirm the diagnosis**: Is there truly an aneurysm (aorta ≥ 3 cm)?
2. **Determine the size**: This dictates surveillance interval vs. surgical intervention (threshold ***~5 cm*** [1][11])
3. **Define the anatomy**: Where is the aneurysm (infrarenal vs. juxta/para/suprarenal)? What is the proximal "neck" length? Is there iliac involvement? — This determines suitability for open repair vs. EVAR [11][3]
4. **Assess for complications**: Is there rupture? Mural thrombus? Distal embolisation? Inflammatory changes? Fistula formation?
5. **Evaluate fitness for surgery**: Cardiac assessment is critical because ***major operative mortality = myocardial infarction*** [1]
6. **Screen for associated aneurysms**: Femoral, popliteal

The investigation you choose depends entirely on the **clinical scenario** — an asymptomatic patient found incidentally needs a different workup than a haemodynamically unstable patient with suspected rupture.

### Diagnostic "Criteria"

AAA does not have formal diagnostic criteria in the way that, say, acute pancreatitis has the Revised Atlanta criteria. Rather, the diagnosis is **defined by measurement**:

> **AAA is diagnosed when the maximum transverse diameter of the abdominal aorta is ≥ 3.0 cm** (i.e., ≥ 50% increase over the normal ~2.0 cm diameter) [1][2].

The clinical diagnosis is supported by:
- **Physical examination**: pulsatile, expansile mass above the umbilicus
- **Confirmed by imaging**: ultrasound (screening/surveillance) or CT angiography (preoperative/acute setting)

For **ruptured AAA**, the diagnosis is clinical:
- ***The TRIAD of Rupture: Pain (abdomen/back), Mass (pulsatile — may be masked), Shock (transient/profound)*** [1]
- In a haemodynamically **unstable** patient with this triad → ***immediate diagnosis → operation*** — no further imaging needed [1][3]
- In a haemodynamically **stable** patient with suspected rupture → ***CT abdomen with contrast*** to confirm and plan repair [3]

<Callout title="Key Principle: Do NOT Delay for Imaging in Unstable Patients" type="error">
***USG cannot diagnose ruptured AAA*** [3] — it can confirm the presence of an aneurysm but cannot reliably detect retroperitoneal haemorrhage. In a haemodynamically unstable patient with clinical triad of rupture, imaging wastes precious time. Proceed directly to the operating theatre. A **FAST scan** may be performed rapidly at the bedside to detect free intraperitoneal fluid (if anterior rupture), but a negative FAST does not exclude retroperitoneal rupture [2][3].

### Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

#### A. Physical Examination [1][2]

This is your **first-line "investigation"** and often the one that triggers the entire diagnostic pathway.

***AAA: Physical Examination*** [1]:

| Component | What to Assess | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|
| ***Confirm AAA*** | ***Mass above umbilicus*** with ***expansile pulsation*** | Pulsatile AND expansile = AAA; pulsatile only = transmitted pulsation from overlying structure |
| ***Extent of AAA*** | ***Size*** (transverse diameter by palpation), ***Upper border*** (can you get above it? → infrarenal), ***Lower border*** (can you get below it? → no iliac involvement) | Defines approximate anatomy before imaging |
| ***Cardiovascular*** | ***Pulses*** (radial, femoral, popliteal, pedal), ***Heart*** (rhythm, murmurs), ***BP*** | Detects associated atherosclerotic disease, AF (embolic risk), aortic valve disease |
| Peripheral aneurysms | Palpate femoral and popliteal arteries | 20% of AAA have associated aneurysms [1] |
| Distal embolisation | Blue toes, livedo reticularis, cool extremities | Suggests mural thrombus with embolisation |

> **Sensitivity caveat**: Abdominal palpation has ~70–80% sensitivity for AAA > 5 cm but is much less reliable in obese patients or for smaller aneurysms. A normal examination does NOT exclude AAA → always confirm with imaging if clinical suspicion exists.

---

#### B. Laboratory Investigations [2]

Laboratory tests **do not diagnose AAA** but are essential for assessing the patient's baseline status, detecting complications, and preparing for surgery.

| Test | Key Findings in AAA | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **CBC with differentials** | **Anaemia** (hypochromic microcytic) | Acute blood loss from rupture → decreased Hb; initially may be normal due to haemodilution lag |
| | **Leukocytosis** | Infected or inflamed aneurysm; stress response in rupture |
| **Clotting profile** (PT, APTT, TT, fibrinogen, D-dimer) | ***Prolonged PT, APTT, TT; ↓ platelet count; ↓ fibrinogen; ↑ D-dimers*** | **DIC** — large aneurysms have a turbulent, slow-flow environment that activates the coagulation cascade within the sac → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → consumptive coagulopathy. D-dimers ↑ because of ongoing clot formation and fibrinolysis [2] |
| **Inflammatory markers** (ESR, CRP) | ***↑ ESR and CRP*** | Elevated in **infected or inflammatory AAA**; normal in uncomplicated degenerative AAA [2] |
| **Renal function tests** (Cr, urea, eGFR) | May be elevated | Baseline for contrast administration; suprarenal/pararenal AAA may compromise renal arteries; post-rupture AKI from hypoperfusion |
| **Liver function tests** | Baseline | Pre-operative assessment; also to detect coagulopathy of liver disease |
| ***Arterial blood gas (ABG)*** | ***Metabolic acidosis*** | ***Acute blood loss leading to shock*** → tissue hypoperfusion → anaerobic metabolism → lactic acidosis [2] |
| **Group and cross-match** | — | Essential pre-operatively; in rupture, request **massive transfusion protocol** (***packed cells : platelets : FFP = 1:1:1***) [3] |
| **ECG** | Baseline; rule out concurrent MI | ***Major operative mortality = myocardial infarction*** [1] — must identify pre-existing ischaemic heart disease |
| **Cardiac enzymes** (Troponin) | Rule out acute MI as differential | Elderly patients with shock may have demand ischaemia |

<Callout title="DIC in AAA — Why?" type="idea">
You might wonder: why would an aneurysm cause DIC? The answer lies in the haemodynamics. Inside a large aneurysm, blood flow becomes turbulent and slow (the dilated segment acts like a stagnant pool). This activates the intrinsic coagulation pathway on the thrombus-lined wall → consumption of clotting factors and platelets → chronic low-grade DIC. This is why you see ↑ D-dimers and prolonged clotting times in patients with large AAA even *before* rupture. Frank DIC becomes clinically significant primarily with very large aneurysms or post-rupture.
</Callout>

#### C. Radiological Investigations

##### 1. ***Plain X-Ray (AXR / Lateral Abdominal X-Ray)*** [1][3]

- **Role**: Not a primary diagnostic tool but may be the **first clue** when AAA is discovered incidentally
- ***Key finding: Calcification of the aortic wall*** — seen as curvilinear calcification outlining the aortic wall on AP or lateral views [1][3]
- ***"Plain X-ray calcifications"*** [1]
- **Limitations**:
  - Only ~50–75% of AAA have enough wall calcification to be visible on XR
  - Cannot measure true aortic diameter (calcification is in the wall, not the lumen)
  - Cannot detect rupture
  - Cannot assess intramural thrombus
- **When you see it**: An elderly patient gets an AXR for non-specific abdominal complaints → you notice curvilinear calcification in the mid-abdomen → suspect AAA → confirm with USS

##### 2. ***Abdominal Ultrasound (USS)*** [1][2][3]

This is the **workhorse investigation** for AAA — think of it as the stethoscope of AAA diagnosis.

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Role** | ***Initial diagnostic modality*** in asymptomatic patients suspected of AAA; ***screening*** tool; ***surveillance*** of known small/medium AAA [2][3] |
| **Advantages** | Non-invasive, inexpensive, no radiation, no contrast, high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (99%) for detecting AAA and measuring diameter, portable (bedside) |
| **What it shows** | Transverse and AP diameter of the aorta; presence of mural thrombus; proximal/distal extent; associated iliac aneurysms |
| **Preparation** | ***Fasting required*** to reduce overlying bowel gas that obscures the aorta [2] |
| **Limitations** | ***USG cannot diagnose ruptured AAA*** [3] — it cannot reliably detect retroperitoneal haemorrhage; operator-dependent; limited by obesity and bowel gas; does not show relationship to renal/visceral arteries well enough for surgical planning |

**Surveillance intervals** [3]:
| AAA Size | Surveillance Frequency |
|---|---|
| 3.0–3.9 cm | ***Yearly USG*** |
| 4.0–5.4 cm | ***USG every 6 months*** |
| ≥ 5.5 cm or rapidly expanding | Proceed to **CTA** for surgical planning |

**FAST scan** (Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma):
- ***Indicated in haemodynamically unstable patients*** [2][3]
- Can rapidly detect **free intraperitoneal fluid** (suggesting anterior rupture) at the bedside
- A FAST showing a large aorta + free fluid + hypotension = go to OT immediately
- **But**: most AAA rupture **posteriorly** (retroperitoneal) → FAST may be **negative** even with rupture → clinical decision must override negative FAST

> ***AAA: Ultrasound*** is explicitly highlighted on the lecture slides as a key diagnostic test [1].

##### 3. ***CT Angiography (CTA)*** [1][2][3]

The **gold standard** for defining AAA anatomy and planning intervention. Think of CTA as the "architectural blueprint" that the surgeon needs.

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Role** | ***Indicated in symptomatic patients*** with suspected AAA [2]; ***preoperative assessment*** of anatomy for suitability for EVAR vs. open repair [3]; diagnosis and characterisation of ruptured AAA in stable patients |
| **What it shows** | Precise diameter measurement; ***relationship to renal arteries*** (crucial for classifying infrarenal vs. juxtarenal/pararenal/suprarenal); proximal neck length and angulation; iliac artery involvement; mural thrombus; retroperitoneal haematoma (if ruptured); inflammatory changes; fistulae; variant anatomy |
| **Protocol** | Non-contrast phase (for calcification) + arterial phase (for lumen and branch vessels) + delayed phase (for endoleak assessment post-EVAR) |
| **Advantages** | High spatial resolution; rapid acquisition (seconds); widely available; excellent for surgical planning |
| **Limitations** | Radiation exposure; IV contrast (risk of contrast-induced nephropathy — especially important given the elderly population with potential baseline renal impairment); ***skip if haemodynamically unstable*** [3] |

**Key CT findings in different scenarios:**

| Scenario | CT Findings |
|---|---|
| **Intact AAA** | Dilated aorta with mural thrombus; patent lumen may appear much smaller than outer diameter (why ***CTA/MRA/DSA are not for size measurement due to intramural thrombus*** [3] — they show the lumen, not the full extent); calcified wall |
| **Ruptured AAA** | Dilated aorta + ***retroperitoneal haematoma*** (high-attenuation stranding/collection adjacent to aorta); ± active contrast extravasation ("blush"); ± haemoperitoneum (if anterior rupture) |
| **Inflammatory AAA** | Thickened aortic wall with periaortic soft tissue cuffing that enhances with contrast; may encase ureters/duodenum |
| **Mycotic AAA** | Saccular morphology; periaortic gas (suggestive of infection); irregular wall; periaortic fluid |
| **Aortoenteric fistula** | Loss of fat plane between aorta/graft and duodenum; periaortic gas; contrast extravasation into bowel lumen |

> ***CT Scan*** — the lecture slides show multiple examples of CT images demonstrating AAA, including suprarenal aneurysm, iliac aneurysms, and mural thrombus [1].

<Callout title="Why Not Use CTA/DSA for Size Surveillance?">
This is a common point of confusion. ***CTA, MRA, and DSA*** show the **patent lumen** of the aorta — the channel through which contrast flows. But AAA almost always contains **mural thrombus** lining the inner wall. This means the patent lumen can appear much smaller than the true outer-to-outer diameter of the aneurysm. **USS measures the true outer wall diameter** and is therefore the correct modality for surveillance. CTA is used preoperatively because it provides *anatomical detail* (not just size) — the relationship to branch vessels, neck morphology, access vessel calibre, etc. [3]
</Callout>

##### 4. ***MR Angiography (MRA)*** [2]

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Role** | ***Comparable to CT*** for anatomical assessment [2]; alternative when CTA is contraindicated |
| **Advantages** | No ionising radiation; no iodinated contrast (uses gadolinium instead — but beware nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in severe renal impairment); excellent soft tissue contrast |
| **Limitations** | Longer acquisition time (not suitable for emergencies); claustrophobia; contraindicated with certain metallic implants (pacemakers, etc.); less available; more expensive; overestimates stenosis |
| **When to use** | ***Patients with IV contrast contraindications*** (e.g., severe iodinated contrast allergy, severe renal impairment where iodinated contrast must be avoided) [2]; young patients requiring serial imaging (to reduce cumulative radiation) |

##### 5. ***Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) / Conventional Angiography*** [3]

- Historically the gold standard; now largely replaced by CTA
- Shows the **lumen** only (not the wall or thrombus) → ***not suitable for measuring AAA size*** [3]
- Still occasionally used intraoperatively or for simultaneous endovascular intervention
- Useful for delineating branch vessel anatomy when CTA is equivocal

##### 6. ***Abdominal X-Ray (AXR)*** — Additional Points [1][3]

- ***Calcification of aortic wall*** may be seen incidentally [1][3]
- An ***"egg-shell" pattern*** of curvilinear calcification in the mid-abdomen on an AP film suggests AAA
- On a **lateral AXR**, you can sometimes estimate the AP diameter from the calcification
- Not a diagnostic investigation per se, but an important incidental finding that should trigger USS

---

#### D. Pre-Operative Assessment [1]

The lecture slides explicitly list the ***AAA: Pre-Operative Preparation*** requirements [1]:

| Category | Components | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***General*** | ***Blood tests, ECG, CXR*** | Baseline assessment; detect anaemia, coagulopathy, renal impairment; CXR for cardiopulmonary status |
| ***Cardiac*** | ***Cardiac assessment / intervention*** | ***Major operative mortality = myocardial infarction*** [1]; patients with significant coronary artery disease may need coronary revascularisation (PCI/CABG) before elective AAA repair |
| ***Preparations*** | ***Monitors, blood*** (cross-matched and available) | Major surgery with potential for massive haemorrhage; ICU bed must be arranged |

**Detailed cardiac workup may include:**
- **Resting ECG**: baseline rhythm, ischaemic changes
- **Transthoracic echocardiogram**: LV function (EF), valvular disease, regional wall motion abnormalities
- **Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)**: objective assessment of functional capacity — helps risk-stratify (anaerobic threshold < 11 mL/kg/min = high risk)
- **Dobutamine stress echocardiography or myocardial perfusion scan**: if unable to exercise, to detect inducible ischaemia
- **Coronary angiography ± PCI/CABG**: if significant inducible ischaemia detected

**Why so much cardiac workup?** Elective open AAA repair involves aortic cross-clamping, which causes:
- **Sudden ↑ afterload** (blood can no longer flow into the distal aorta) → ↑ LV wall stress → risk of myocardial ischaemia
- **Sudden ↓ afterload** on unclamping → peripheral vasodilation + reperfusion → risk of hypotension and arrhythmia
- These haemodynamic swings are lethal in a patient with unrecognised severe coronary disease

---

#### E. Screening [1]

***AAA Screening in Men over 65*** is specifically covered in the lecture slides [1]:

- The ***Multicenter Aneurysm Study (MASS), Lancet 2002*** demonstrated that ***AAA screening reduces mortality in men*** — specifically, a **one-time USS screening** in men aged 65–74 reduced AAA-related mortality by ~42% over 4 years [1]
- Screening is **cost-effective** because it identifies asymptomatic AAA → enables elective repair (mortality 3–5%) rather than emergency repair for rupture (mortality > 50%) [1]
- ***Lindholdt 2008*** further confirmed the mortality benefit of screening [1]

**Current screening recommendations:**
| Population | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Men aged 65–75 who have ever smoked | One-time USS screening |
| Men or women with first-degree relative with AAA | One-time USS screening |
| Women who have never smoked, no FHx | Not routinely recommended |

---

### Summary of Investigations by Clinical Scenario

| Scenario | Primary Investigation | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Screening / Incidental** | ***Abdominal USS*** | Non-invasive, accurate for diameter, cheap, no radiation |
| **Surveillance of known AAA** | ***Serial USS*** (yearly or 6-monthly depending on size) | Track growth rate; no radiation burden for repeated scans |
| **Symptomatic AAA (stable)** | ***CTA*** | Defines anatomy, detects impending rupture, guides surgical planning |
| **Suspected ruptured AAA (stable)** | ***CTA*** | Confirms rupture, localises haematoma, assesses EVAR suitability |
| **Suspected ruptured AAA (unstable)** | ***Bedside FAST ± clinical diagnosis → straight to OT*** | ***Skip CT if haemodynamically unstable*** [3]; delay = death |
| **Pre-operative planning for elective repair** | ***CTA*** (or MRA if contrast contraindicated) | Detailed anatomy for open vs. EVAR decision |
| **Post-EVAR surveillance** | ***CTA*** (or contrast-enhanced USS) | Detect endoleaks, graft migration, continued sac expansion |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Diagnosis of AAA">

1. **AAA is defined by aortic diameter ≥ 3 cm**; diagnosed definitively by imaging (USS for screening/surveillance, CTA for surgical planning).
2. ***USS is the initial diagnostic modality*** — non-invasive, cheap, high sensitivity/specificity. Used for screening (men > 65, MASS trial) and surveillance. ***Cannot diagnose rupture*** [3].
3. ***CTA is the gold standard for anatomical planning*** — shows proximal neck, renal artery relationship, iliac extent, mural thrombus, and detects rupture. ***Skip if haemodynamically unstable*** [3].
4. ***CTA/MRA/DSA are NOT for size measurement*** because intramural thrombus makes the lumen appear smaller than the true aneurysm diameter [3].
5. ***Plain X-ray may show calcification of the aortic wall*** incidentally [1] — trigger USS for confirmation.
6. ***Ruptured AAA in unstable patients = clinical diagnosis → immediate surgery***: resuscitate, permissive hypotension (SBP 80–100), FAST scan at bedside, straight to OT [1][3].
7. **Lab tests**: CBC (anaemia from haemorrhage), clotting (DIC), inflammatory markers (infected/inflammatory AAA), ***ABG (metabolic acidosis in shock)***, G+XM (prepare blood) [2].
8. ***Pre-operative preparation: blood tests, ECG, CXR + cardiac assessment + blood preparation*** — because ***major operative mortality = myocardial infarction*** [1].
9. **Surveillance**: 3.0–3.9 cm → yearly USS; 4.0–5.4 cm → 6-monthly USS; ≥ 5.5 cm → CTA + surgical referral [3].
10. ***MASS trial (Lancet 2002)***: USS screening in men > 65 reduces AAA-related mortality [1].
