## Complications of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)

Complications of AAA can be divided into two broad categories:

1. **Complications of the aneurysm itself** (natural history) — what happens if you leave the aneurysm alone
2. **Complications of treatment** (operative/post-operative) — what happens as a consequence of repair

Both categories are heavily tested and explicitly covered on the lecture slides. Let's work through each systematically, always explaining *why* each complication occurs from first principles.

---

### A. Complications of the Aneurysm Itself (Natural History)

***Complications of Aneurysms*** [1]:

- ***Rupture***
- ***Thrombosis***
- ***Embolism***
- ***Infection***
- ***Pressure effects***

These five complications are directly listed on the lecture slides and represent the core framework for understanding what an untreated or expanding aneurysm can do [1].

#### 1. ***Rupture*** [1][13]

This is the most feared and lethal complication. The mechanism is fundamentally explained by **Laplace's Law** — as the aneurysm expands, wall tension increases while wall thickness decreases, until the wall can no longer contain the transmural pressure and fails catastrophically.

***Risk of rupture at five years*** [1]:
- ***Aneurysm < 5 cm: 20%***
- ***Aneurysm > 5 cm: 50% (10% per year)***

The direction of rupture determines the clinical presentation and prognosis [1][13]:

| Direction | Slide Terminology | Pathophysiology | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Retroperitoneal*** | ***Retroperitoneal*** | Posterior wall rupture → blood tracks into the confined retroperitoneal space → haematoma is *temporarily contained* by surrounding tissues (psoas, vertebral bodies, perirenal fascia) | ***Contained rupture*** — patient may be transiently stable. Severe back/flank pain initially, may temporarily subside as haematoma tamponades, then catastrophic decompensation when tamponade fails [13] |
| ***Intraperitoneal (Free)*** | ***Intraperitoneal (Free)*** | Anterior wall rupture → blood enters the peritoneal cavity, a large and non-confined space → no tamponade effect | ***Free rupture*** — rapid exsanguination, profound haemodynamic collapse. This is the most immediately lethal pattern [1][13] |
| ***Into duodenum*** | ***Into duodenum (GI bleeding)*** | Aneurysm erodes into the 3rd or 4th portion of the duodenum (which lies directly anterior to the aorta) → **aortoenteric (aortoduodenal) fistula** | ***Massive upper GI bleeding*** (haematemesis, melaena). A "herald bleed" — a small, self-limiting bleed — may precede catastrophic haemorrhage by hours to days, providing a narrow diagnostic window [1][13][14] |
| ***Into IVC*** | ***Into IVC (Heart failure)*** | Aneurysm ruptures into the IVC (which lies immediately to the right of the aorta) → **aortocaval fistula** → massive arterio-venous shunt | ***High-output heart failure*** — sudden onset of bilateral lower limb oedema, raised JVP, continuous abdominal "machinery" bruit, renal impairment from venous hypertension [1][13] |

<Callout title="Rupture Mortality — The Grim Statistics" type="error">
From the lecture slides [1]:
- ***Only 1 in 3 reaches hospital alive***
- ***Operative mortality > 50%***
- ***Overall mortality > 80%***
- ***Unoperated rupture: 100% mortality***

The "Rule of 50s" [3]: 50% reach hospital → 50% make it to OT → 50% survive OT. This cascading attrition is why **screening and elective repair** are so important — elective mortality is 3–5% vs. > 50% for emergency repair [1].
</Callout>

#### 2. ***Thrombosis*** [1]

**Why does thrombus form in AAA?** The answer lies in **Virchow's triad**:

1. **Stasis** — the dilated aneurysm sac has turbulent, slow-flow blood, especially along the wall → promotes stasis
2. **Endothelial injury** — the diseased, atherosclerotic intima is a pro-thrombotic surface
3. **Hypercoagulability** — chronic activation of the coagulation cascade within the sac (this is also why large AAA can cause low-grade DIC [2])

**Consequences of thrombosis:**
- **Mural thrombus** lines the aneurysm wall in virtually all AAA > 4 cm — it does NOT protect against rupture (a common misconception); it simply sits there and serves as a source for embolism
- **Acute aortic thrombosis** (rare) — complete occlusion of the aortic lumen → acute bilateral lower limb ischaemia (a vascular emergency)
- **Iliac extension** — thrombus can propagate distally into the iliac arteries → unilateral or bilateral limb ischaemia

#### 3. ***Embolism*** [1]

**Why does embolism occur?** Mural thrombus and atherosclerotic debris within the aneurysm sac are in constant contact with flowing blood. Fragments of thrombus or cholesterol crystals can break off and travel distally → occlude smaller peripheral arteries.

**Clinical manifestations of embolism from AAA:**

| Presentation | Mechanism | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Trash foot / Blue toe syndrome*** | Cholesterol crystal or micro-thrombus emboli occlude **small digital arteries** in the foot | ***Painful, cyanotic toes with palpable pedal pulses*** — the major vessels are patent, but the tiny end-arteries are blocked [1][13]. ***Complication: Trash Foot*** is specifically shown on the lecture slides [1] |
| **Acute limb ischaemia** | Large thrombus fragment embolises to **femoral or popliteal bifurcation** | Sudden onset of the "6 Ps" — Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Perishing cold, Paraesthesia, Paralysis |
| **Renal embolism** | Thrombus embolises to renal arteries | Flank pain, haematuria, acute renal impairment |
| **Mesenteric embolism** | Thrombus embolises to SMA/IMA | Acute mesenteric ischaemia — severe abdominal pain out of proportion to examination |

#### 4. ***Infection*** [1]

**Mechanisms:**
- **Primary mycotic aneurysm** — haematogenous seeding of the atherosclerotic aortic wall by bacteria (Salmonella, Staph aureus, Syphilis) → infection destroys the media → rapid expansion and high rupture risk
- **Secondary infection** of an existing AAA — bacteraemia from a distant source seeds the thrombus/wall
- **Post-graft infection** (covered under operative complications)

**Clinical features of infected AAA**: fever, raised WCC, elevated ESR/CRP, back/abdominal pain, positive blood cultures. CT may show periaortic gas, saccular morphology, rapid size change.

**In Hong Kong**: non-typhoid Salmonella mycotic aneurysm is particularly important in elderly/immunocompromised patients [3].

#### 5. ***Pressure effects*** [1]

As the aneurysm expands, it can compress adjacent retroperitoneal structures:

| Structure Compressed | Clinical Effect | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Lumbar vertebral bodies / spine** | Back pain, vertebral erosion | Direct mechanical compression/erosion of bone |
| **Ureters** | Hydronephrosis, renal impairment, flank pain | Usually the left ureter (closer to the aorta); compression → obstruction of urine flow |
| **Duodenum** | Nausea, vomiting, early satiety, gastric outlet obstruction (rare) | 3rd/4th part of duodenum crosses anterior to the aorta |
| **IVC** | Lower limb oedema (bilateral), DVT | Extrinsic compression reduces venous return |
| **Lumbar nerve plexus** | Radiculopathy, groin/thigh pain | Compression of L2–L4 nerve roots |

---

### B. Complications of Surgical Treatment

These are divided by **timing** (early vs. late) and by **procedure type** (open repair vs. EVAR). The lecture slides explicitly categorise them [1].

#### Open Repair — Early Complications

##### General Complications [1]

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Cardiac (Clamp / Declamp)*** | **Clamping**: sudden ↑ afterload → ↑ myocardial oxygen demand → ischaemia/MI/arrhythmia. **Declamp**: sudden ↓ afterload + washout of anaerobic metabolites from ischaemic lower body → hypotension, metabolic acidosis, arrhythmia, reperfusion injury | ***Major operative mortality = myocardial infarction*** [1]. This is why rigorous **cardiac pre-operative assessment** is mandatory. The clamp-declamp cycle is the single most dangerous haemodynamic event in the procedure |
| ***Respiratory*** | Post-operative atelectasis (especially with transabdominal approach — diaphragmatic splinting from pain); pneumonia; ARDS (especially if massive transfusion) | Risk compounded in COPD patients (common in this population due to shared smoking RF); retroperitoneal approach avoids laparotomy and may reduce respiratory complications [11] |

##### Specific Complications [1][11][12]

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention / Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***Haemorrhage*** | Intraoperative bleeding from aorta, iliac vessels, lumbar arteries, or anastomotic suture lines; post-operative reactionary haemorrhage | Meticulous surgical technique; adequate heparin reversal with protamine; monitoring drain output post-op |
| ***Bowel ischaemia*** | ***Ischaemic colitis related to ligation of the IMA*** in the absence of adequate collateral circulation (marginal artery of Drummond, arc of Riolan) [12]. The sigmoid and left colon are most vulnerable ("watershed" zone). Also from hypotension during surgery or embolism | ***Presents with postoperative fever, leukocytosis, and peritonitis*** [12]. Management depends on depth: **mucosal necrosis** → IV antibiotics + bowel rest; **muscularis necrosis** → delayed segmental resection; ***transmural necrosis requires immediate resection of necrotic colon and end colostomy*** [12] |
| ***Impotence / Sexual dysfunction*** | ***Damage to the sympathetic plexus during dissection near the proximal left common iliac artery*** → retrograde ejaculation, erectile dysfunction [11][12] | Careful tissue handling during left iliac dissection; nerve-sparing technique |
| ***Renal failure*** | Multiple mechanisms: ***IV contrast nephrotoxicity, inadequate hydration, hypotension, renal ischaemia from suprarenal clamping, embolisation to renal arteries*** [11] | Pre-hydration; minimise contrast volume; minimise suprarenal clamp time; maintain adequate perfusion pressure |
| ***Distal embolism (Trash foot)*** | ***Atherosclerotic debris dislodged during manipulation of aneurysm*** → microembolisation to digital arteries [1][11] | Prevention: ***minimise manipulation of aneurysm prior to clamping***; Treatment: ***Fogarty balloon catheters*** to remove distal emboli intraoperatively [11]; expectant management if major vessels patent; ***amputation if significant necrosis*** [11] |
| ***Paraplegia*** | ***Spinal cord ischaemia*** — disruption of the artery of Adamkiewicz (major radiculomedullary artery, typically T9–T12) or anterior spinal artery [1][11] | More common in suprarenal/thoracoabdominal repairs (higher clamp); risk increases with prolonged cross-clamp time; CSF drainage, distal perfusion adjuncts can reduce risk |

<Callout title="Why Does IMA Ligation Cause Bowel Ischaemia?">
The IMA supplies the left colon (splenic flexure to upper rectum). During AAA repair, the IMA origin is usually within the aneurysm sac and is ligated. Normally, collateral flow from the **SMA via the marginal artery of Drummond** and **arc of Riolan** compensates. However, if these collaterals are inadequate (due to atherosclerosis of the SMA, prior colonic resection, or hypotension during surgery), the left colon becomes ischaemic. The **splenic flexure** ("Griffiths' point") and **rectosigmoid junction** ("Sudeck's point") are the classic watershed zones most vulnerable to ischaemia.
</Callout>

#### Open Repair — ***Late Complications*** [1]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Presentation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Graft infection*** | Bacterial seeding of the synthetic prosthetic graft — organisms include Staph aureus, Staph epidermidis, enteric Gram-negatives; can occur months to years post-operatively | Fever, sepsis, peri-graft fluid/gas on CT; may present as recurrent bacteraemia; false aneurysm at anastomosis |
| ***Anastomotic aneurysm*** | **Pseudo-aneurysm** at suture line — suture degradation, infection, or arterial wall degeneration at the junction between graft and native vessel | Pulsatile mass at groin (if bifurcated graft) or in abdomen; risk of rupture or embolisation |
| ***Graft-duodenal fistula*** | Graft erodes into the duodenum (usually the 3rd or 4th portion) — this is why the aneurysm sac is wrapped around the graft at the time of surgery (to interpose tissue between graft and duodenum) [12] | ***Aortoenteric fistula***: UGIB (haematemesis, melaena) + fever + abdominal pain. ***Classic triad: UGIB, fever, abdominal pain*** [3]. May present years after original repair. ***"Herald bleed"*** precedes catastrophic haemorrhage [14] |

**Management of aortoenteric fistula** [3]:
- ***Ix: OGD (up to D4), contrast-enhanced CT abdomen***
- ***Mx: Graft excision with extra-anatomical bypass*** (e.g., axillo-bifemoral bypass — reroutes blood supply through a clean field, away from the infected/eroded area) [3]

---

#### EVAR — Specific Complications [3][12][13]

EVAR avoids laparotomy and aortic cross-clamping, so the **general complications** (cardiac clamp/declamp, respiratory from laparotomy) are significantly reduced. However, EVAR introduces its **own unique complications**:

##### Access Site Complications [3]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Bleeding / haematoma*** | Femoral arteriotomy or percutaneous access site → haematoma formation |
| ***Pseudoaneurysm*** | Incomplete closure of arteriotomy → contained leak → pulsatile groin mass |
| ***AV fistula*** | Arterial puncture inadvertently communicates with adjacent femoral vein |
| ***Thromboembolism*** | Manipulation of guidewires/catheters in diseased iliac arteries → dislodge thrombus/debris |

##### Vascular Complications [12][13]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Iliac artery injury*** — ***especially iliac artery avulsion at the iliac bifurcation*** | Forced passage of the bulky delivery system through small, tortuous, or calcified iliac arteries → vessel rupture or avulsion. This can be immediately life-threatening [12] |
| ***Arterial dissection*** | Guidewire or graft deployment damages the intima → dissection flap; may require ***additional stent*** to treat [12] |

##### Endograft-Related Complications [1][3][12][13]

***Endoleaks*** are the signature complication of EVAR — ***defined as failure to exclude the aneurysmal sac from arterial blood flow, potentially predisposing to rupture*** [12].

***Types I and III have continuous direct flow into AAA → require re-operation!*** [3]

| Type | Description | Management |
|---|---|---|
| ***I*** | ***Seal failure at proximal / distal end*** — usually stent migration. Subtypes: Ia (proximal), Ib (distal), Ic (iliac occluder) | ***Repeat EVAR*** (extension cuff, re-ballooning) or conversion to open [3] |
| ***II*** | ***Backflow from side branches*** (lumbar arteries / IMA) — ***most common type*** of endoleak, a.k.a. "retroleak". Subtypes: IIa (1 vessel), IIb (≥ 2 vessels) | ***Close observation for AAA expansion → laparoscopic / open clipping or IR embolisation*** if sac growing [3] |
| ***III*** | ***Stent break (fabric tear), modular dehiscence***. Subtypes: IIIa (segment disconnection), IIIb (fabric holes) | ***Repair defect / bridge across defect*** [3] |
| ***IV*** | ***Porosity: blood seeps through small pores of endograft material*** (< 30 days post-placement) | ***Observe*** — self-limiting [3][13] |
| ***V*** | ***Flow visualised but source not identified ("endotension")*** | ***Observe*** [3] |

Other endograft-related complications [12][13]:
- ***Graft infection*** — less common than open repair but devastating; may require conversion to open surgery
- ***Graft thrombosis*** — limb occlusion of the bifurcated endograft → acute limb ischaemia
- ***Graft migration*** — device moves distally over time → loss of proximal seal → Type Ia endoleak

##### Systemic Complications After EVAR [3]

These are similar to open repair but generally **less severe** because the aorta is not cross-clamped:
- **Ischaemic complications**: lower limb, renal, bowel, pelvic (sexual dysfunction from **pelvic artery injury**)
- **Contrast complications**: ***nephropathy, allergy*** [3]

---

#### Ruptured AAA — Specific Post-Operative Complications [1]

The post-operative course after repair of a ruptured AAA is far more stormy than after elective repair. The lecture slides provide a specific list with their causative mechanisms in parentheses [1]:

| Complication | Causative Mechanism (from slides) | Pathophysiological Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Cardiac*** | ***(Shock)*** | Prolonged hypoperfusion → demand ischaemia → MI, arrhythmias; reperfusion injury after repair; massive fluid shifts |
| ***Respiratory*** | ***(Shock)*** | ARDS from massive transfusion (transfusion-related acute lung injury — TRALI); pulmonary oedema from fluid overload during resuscitation; atelectasis |
| ***Renal failure*** | ***(Shock)*** | Prolonged hypotension → acute tubular necrosis (ATN); suprarenal clamping during emergency repair → direct renal ischaemia; contrast nephropathy; myoglobin from lower limb rhabdomyolysis |
| ***Bleeding tendency*** | ***(Massive transfusion)*** | Dilutional coagulopathy (large volumes of crystalloid/pRBC without adequate FFP/platelets); consumption of clotting factors (DIC); hypothermia impairs clotting cascade; acidosis impairs clotting factor function → the **lethal triad** (hypothermia + acidosis + coagulopathy) |
| ***Paralytic ileus*** | ***(Retroperitoneal haematoma)*** | Large retroperitoneal haematoma irritates the retroperitoneal autonomic plexus → sympathetic activation → gut hypomotility → functional bowel obstruction; also opioid analgesia and electrolyte disturbance contribute |
| ***Jaundice*** | ***(Bleeding + transfusion)*** | Multiple mechanisms: (1) Haemolysis of transfused blood → ↑ unconjugated bilirubin; (2) Hepatic hypoperfusion from shock → ischaemic hepatitis → ↑ conjugated bilirubin; (3) Resorption of large retroperitoneal haematoma → bilirubin load from breakdown of extravasated red cells |

<Callout title="The Lethal Triad of Trauma">
After ruptured AAA repair (or any major haemorrhagic emergency), be vigilant for the **lethal triad**:
1. **Hypothermia** — cold fluids, exposed body cavity, impaired thermoregulation from shock
2. **Acidosis** — lactic acidosis from tissue hypoperfusion
3. **Coagulopathy** — clotting factors consumed (DIC), diluted (massive crystalloid), and dysfunctional (hypothermia + acidosis inhibit clotting enzyme activity)

Each element worsens the other two in a vicious cycle. This is why **damage control surgery** (rapidly control bleeding → ICU resuscitation → staged definitive repair) and **balanced massive transfusion** (pRBC:PLT:FFP = 1:1:1) are essential principles [3].
