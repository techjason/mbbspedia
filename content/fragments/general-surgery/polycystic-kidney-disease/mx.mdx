## Management of ADPKD

### Overview: The Management Philosophy

Let me frame this clearly. ADPKD management has **four pillars**:

1. **Slow disease progression** (the holy grail — delay ESRD by years)
2. **Manage complications** (pain, infection, stones, haematuria, hypertension)
3. **Screen for and manage extrarenal manifestations** (cerebral aneurysms, liver cysts, cardiac)
4. **Renal replacement therapy** when ESRD inevitably arrives

Until 2015, we had NO disease-modifying therapy — only supportive measures. The approval of **tolvaptan** changed the landscape. But the reality is that most of the management is still about good CKD care, aggressive BP control, and dealing with complications as they arise.

### B. Detailed Management

#### B1. Non-Pharmacological Measures (Lifestyle)

These are the foundation of management for ALL ADPKD patients, regardless of disease stage.

| Measure | Detail | Rationale (First Principles) |
|---|---|---|
| ***Dietary sodium restriction < 2 g/day*** | Equivalent to < 5 g NaCl/day | Reduces extracellular volume expansion → ↓BP; high salt intake independently accelerates cyst growth via osmotic mechanisms and volume-mediated RAAS stimulation [1] |
| ***Increased fluid intake*** (2.5–3 L/day) | Water is the preferred fluid; spread throughout the day including before bed | ***Suppresses vasopressin level, which is postulated to be a therapeutic mechanism to inhibit cystic growth in ADPKD*** [1]. The logic: water intake → ↓serum osmolality → ↓ADH release → ↓V2 receptor activation → ↓cAMP in collecting duct cells → ↓cyst growth. This is the same pathway that tolvaptan targets pharmacologically. |
| **Avoid caffeine** | Limit coffee, tea, energy drinks | Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase → ↓cAMP breakdown → ↑cAMP accumulation → theoretically accelerates cyst growth |
| **Regular exercise** | 30 min/day, most days of the week; avoid contact sports if kidneys very large | Cardiovascular benefit, weight control, ↓BP. Avoid contact sports/activities with high risk of abdominal trauma (risk of cyst rupture/haemorrhage in very enlarged kidneys). |
| **Moderate protein intake** | 0.8–1.0 g/kg/day if CKD stage 3+; avoid high protein > 1.3 g/kg/day | Reduces hyperfiltration in remaining nephrons; excessive protein → ↑urea generation → ↑uraemic symptoms [14] |
| **Weight control** | Maintain BMI 18.5–25 | Obesity is an independent risk factor for CKD progression and CVD |
| **Smoking cessation** | Absolute | Smoking accelerates CKD progression and is a major CVD risk factor |

---

#### B2. Blood Pressure Control

Hypertension is the **earliest treatable risk factor** in ADPKD and the single most important modifiable factor for slowing CKD progression and reducing cardiovascular morbidity.

##### BP Targets

The HALT-PKD trial (2014) established the evidence base:

| Patient Profile | BP Target | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Age 18–50 with eGFR > 60** | **< 95/60 to 110/75** (i.e. **< 110/75**) for HALT-PKD; practically **≤ 130/80** per KDIGO | HALT-PKD Study A showed that intensive BP control (95–110/60–75) slowed TKV growth and reduced LVH, urinary albumin excretion, and LV mass index |
| **Older patients or eGFR < 60** | ***140/90 mmHg*** | ***Do NOT maintain SBP to 110 mmHg in patients with moderate or advanced disease since it may increase the risk of renal disease progression by reducing renal blood flow*** [1] |

<Callout title="Why Intensive BP Harms in Advanced CKD" type="error">
In advanced CKD (eGFR < 60), the remaining nephrons are already maximally vasodilated to maintain filtration. If you drop systemic BP too low, you reduce perfusion to these nephrons below the autoregulatory threshold → ischaemia → paradoxically accelerate nephron loss. This is why we are MORE aggressive with BP lowering in early disease (where the kidneys can still autoregulate) and MORE cautious in advanced disease. [1]
</Callout>

##### Choice of Antihypertensive

| Drug | Role | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ***ACEI (first-line)*** | ***First-line antihypertensive unless contraindicated*** | ***Increased RAAS activity and extracellular volume expansion is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in patients with ADPKD*** [1]. ACEI blocks Ang I → Ang II conversion → ↓vasoconstriction, ↓aldosterone, ↓sodium retention. Also has antiproteinuric and antifibrotic effects. |
| ***ARB*** | ***Should be considered in patients intolerant of ACEI due to dry cough or angioedema*** | ARB blocks the Ang II type 1 receptor directly. Same downstream effects as ACEI but without the bradykinin accumulation that causes cough (ACEI inhibits kininase II, which normally degrades bradykinin → ↑bradykinin → cough). [1] |
| **Dual ACEI + ARB** | NOT recommended routinely | HALT-PKD Study A tested ACEI + ARB combination. No additional benefit in TKV or eGFR preservation over ACEI alone, but ↑risk of hyperkalaemia and AKI. |
| **CCB, diuretics, beta-blockers** | Second-line add-on agents | Used when BP not controlled with ACEI/ARB alone. Standard hypertension combination approach: A + C, then A + C + D [3] |

> **High Yield**: ***Control of BP can prevent progression of renal disease and decreases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity*** [1]. ACEI/ARB are preferred in ADPKD even though they do NOT have the same strong anti-proteinuric rationale as in diabetic CKD (because proteinuria is NOT a major feature of ADPKD [1]). The benefit is primarily through RAAS blockade and BP lowering. [14]

#### B3. Disease-Modifying Therapy: Tolvaptan

This is the landmark advance in ADPKD management. Tolvaptan ("tolva" = tolvaptan, "ptan" = vasopressin receptor antagonist, member of the "vaptan" class) is a **selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist**.

##### Mechanism of Action — From First Principles

1. ADH (vasopressin) binds V2 receptors on the **basolateral membrane of collecting duct principal cells**
2. V2 receptor activation → Gs protein → **adenylyl cyclase activation → ↑cAMP**
3. In ADPKD, the polycystin defect means cAMP is already unopposed (because the Ca²⁺-mediated brake on cAMP is lost)
4. cAMP drives: (a) CFTR Cl⁻ secretion → fluid into cyst; (b) cell proliferation → cyst wall growth
5. **Tolvaptan blocks V2 receptors** → ↓adenylyl cyclase activation → **↓cAMP** → ↓fluid secretion + ↓cell proliferation → **slowed cyst growth**
6. Side effect: blocking V2 receptors also blocks ADH-mediated aquaporin-2 insertion → **aquaresis** (free water excretion) → polyuria + polydipsia + thirst (essentially iatrogenic nephrogenic DI)

##### Evidence Base

| Trial | Design | Key Finding |
|---|---|---|
| **TEMPO 3:4** (2012) | RCT, n=1445, 3 years | Tolvaptan slowed TKV growth by 49% (2.8% vs 5.5%/year) and reduced rate of GFR decline |
| **REPRISE** (2017) | RCT, n=1370, 1 year | Tolvaptan slowed eGFR decline by 1.27 mL/min/year in later-stage CKD (eGFR 25–65). Extended indication to CKD stages 2–4. |

##### Indications and Eligibility

Tolvaptan is indicated for **adults with ADPKD who are at risk of rapid disease progression**:

| Criterion | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Age** | 18–55 years (limited data in older patients) |
| **eGFR** | > 25 mL/min/1.73m² (benefit diminishes below this) |
| **Evidence of rapid progression** | Mayo Class 1C–1E (htTKV growth > 3%/year); OR confirmed eGFR decline > 2.5 mL/min/year over 5 years; OR PROPKD score ≥ 7 |
| **CKD stage** | Typically CKD stages 1–4 (eGFR 25–90+) |

##### Contraindications

| Contraindication | Reason |
|---|---|
| **Liver disease** (hepatic impairment) | Tolvaptan is hepatotoxic — can cause **idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (DILI)**. Fatal hepatotoxicity has been reported. Requires monthly LFT monitoring for first 18 months, then every 3 months. |
| **Volume depletion / inability to drink water** | Tolvaptan causes massive aquaresis (up to 6–8 L/day of dilute urine). If the patient cannot freely access water, they will become severely dehydrated and hypernatraemic. |
| **Pregnancy and breastfeeding** | Teratogenic risk; women of childbearing age must use effective contraception. |
| **Hypovolaemia / hypernatraemia** | Will be worsened by aquaresis |
| **Anuria** | No benefit if kidneys are non-functional |
| **Unable to perceive thirst** | Risk of severe dehydration |

##### Monitoring on Tolvaptan

| Parameter | Frequency | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **LFTs (ALT, AST, bilirubin)** | Monthly for first 18 months, then every 3 months | DILI risk — **stop immediately if ALT or AST > 3× ULN or if any liver symptoms** |
| **Serum sodium** | At initiation and during dose titration | Risk of hypernatraemia from aquaresis |
| **Body weight, I/O** | At initiation | Ensure patient is not becoming dehydrated |
| **RFT** | Every 3–6 months | Monitor ongoing GFR trajectory |
| **TKV by MRI** | Annually or per protocol | Assess treatment response |

##### Practical Side Effects and Counselling

The dominant side effects are all consequences of V2 blockade → aquaresis:
- **Polyuria** (often 4–6 L/day, sometimes more) — patients must have easy access to a toilet
- **Thirst and polydipsia** — patients MUST drink freely; never restrict water
- **Nocturia** — significant impact on quality of life; some patients take split dosing (higher morning dose, lower evening dose)
- **Hypernatraemia** — if not drinking enough
- **Hepatotoxicity** — idiosyncratic, unrelated to dose; monitor LFTs strictly

<Callout title="Tolvaptan Counselling Mnemonic: WATER">
**W** = Water intake must be free and unrestricted
**A** = ALT/AST monitoring monthly (liver injury risk)
**T** = Toilet access must be available (massive polyuria)
**E** = Effective contraception required (women)
**R** = Regular follow-up for Na, RFT, TKV
</Callout>

#### B4. Management of Specific Complications

##### Pain Management

Pain is the most common reason ADPKD patients seek medical attention (~60% of patients) [1]. Causes include cyst enlargement (capsular stretching), cyst haemorrhage, cyst infection, and nephrolithiasis.

| Approach | Detail | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Simple analgesia** | Paracetamol (first-line) | Safe in CKD; avoid NSAIDs (nephrotoxic + reduce GFR via prostaglandin inhibition → afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction) |
| **Avoid NSAIDs** | Contraindicated | ↓prostaglandins → ↓afferent arteriolar dilatation → ↓GFR; also ↑risk of AKI and GI bleeding; interfere with antihypertensive effect of ACEI/ARB |
| **Weak opioids** | Codeine, tramadol (short-term) | For moderate pain; avoid long-term use due to dependence and constipation |
| **Cyst aspiration ± sclerotherapy** | CT/USG-guided aspiration; inject sclerosant (ethanol/povidone-iodine) | For dominant symptomatic cysts causing focal pain. Aspiration alone has high recurrence (~80%); sclerotherapy reduces recurrence. |
| **Laparoscopic cyst decortication (fenestration/deroofing)** | Laparoscopic or open surgical unroofing of superficial cysts | For multiple symptomatic cysts; removes cyst wall to decompress. Provides temporary relief but cysts recur. |
| ***Nephrectomy*** | ***Should be avoided whenever possible in ADPKD*** [1] | Reserved as last resort. ***Most often considered for pain that is constant and requires narcotic medications or is associated with reduced QOL extending over prolonged periods of time.*** [1] |

***Indications for nephrectomy:*** [1]
- ***Chronic pain***
- ***Chronic haematuria requiring transfusion***
- ***Recurrent cyst infections or UTI***
- ***Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)***
- ***Uncontrolled renal haemorrhage in patients contraindicated to or failure with intra-arterial embolization***
- ***Marked limitation of daily activities such as fatigue, anorexia and other signs of malnutrition***

##### Cyst Infection

This is a particularly challenging complication because most antibiotics cannot penetrate the cyst wall effectively.

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Organisms** | Usually **Gram-negative enteric organisms** (E. coli, Klebsiella, Proteus) from ascending UTI |
| **Clinical features** | Fever, flank pain/tenderness localized to a cyst; may not have LUTS; blood cultures often positive; urine culture may be NEGATIVE (if cyst does not communicate with collecting system) |
| **Diagnosis** | CT or MRI (thickened cyst wall, rim enhancement, gas within cyst); PET-CT or gallium scan for localization if needed; FDG-PET is the most sensitive for localizing infected cysts |
| ***Antibiotic choice*** | ***Lipid-soluble antibiotics against Gram-negative enteric organisms are preferred for cyst infection*** [1] |
| ***Duration*** | ***Requires 4–6 weeks of treatment*** [1] |
| ***Specific agents*** | ***Cotrimoxazole / Fluoroquinolones*** [1] |
| **Why lipid-soluble?** | Cyst walls are lined by epithelium with tight junctions → water-soluble antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, beta-lactams) penetrate poorly into the cyst fluid. Lipid-soluble agents (fluoroquinolones, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, metronidazole) cross the lipid bilayer of cyst epithelial cells and achieve adequate intracystic concentrations. |
| **If medical therapy fails** | CT-guided percutaneous cyst aspiration and drainage ± intracystic antibiotic instillation |

<Callout title="Cyst Infection Pearl" type="idea">
If a patient with ADPKD has fever and flank pain but a NEGATIVE urine culture, think **cyst infection** — the infected cyst may not communicate with the collecting system. Blood cultures are more likely to be positive. CT or PET-CT can help localize the infected cyst.
</Callout>

##### Gross Haematuria

| Approach | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Conservative (first-line)** | ***Bedrest, hydration, and analgesics*** [1]. Most episodes are self-limiting (2–7 days). Avoid anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents during acute episode. |
| **If persistent and severe** | ***Percutaneous arterial embolization or nephrectomy*** [1] — these are last resorts for life-threatening haemorrhage that does not settle with conservative measures. |
| **Avoid vigorous physical activity** | During and for 2 weeks after episode to prevent recurrence |

##### Nephrolithiasis

~20–30% of ADPKD patients develop stones, predominantly **uric acid** (due to low urinary pH and stasis) and **calcium oxalate** (due to low urinary citrate). [1]

| Approach | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Prevention** | ↑fluid intake (≥ 3 L/day), ↓sodium intake (< 2 g/day), potassium citrate supplementation (↑urinary citrate + ↑urinary pH for uric acid stones) |
| **Acute management** | Standard: analgesia (paracetamol, avoid NSAIDs), α-blocker (tamsulosin for MET if distal ureteric stone 5–10 mm) [15] |
| **Definitive treatment** | ESWL has ↓success rate in ADPKD (stones obscured by cysts on imaging; fragments trapped in distorted collecting system). Ureteroscopy or PCNL may be preferred depending on stone size and location. [15] |

---

#### B5. CKD-Specific Management (As eGFR Declines)

As ADPKD progresses, standard CKD management applies — this is identical to CKD from any cause:

| Complication | Management | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Anaemia** | ESA (erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g., Mircera) + IV iron | Start when Hb < 10 g/dL; target Hb 10–11.5 g/dL; ADPKD patients tend to have less severe anaemia than other CKD patients (cyst lining retains some EPO capacity) [14] |
| **CKD-MBD** | Phosphate binders, vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics | ↓PO4 retention + ↓PTH + correct hypoCa; phosphate binders taken with meals [14] |
| **Metabolic acidosis** | Oral NaHCO₃ or citrate supplements | Target serum HCO₃⁻ 23–29 mmol/L; ↓bone resorption, ↓protein catabolism [14] |
| **Hyperkalaemia** | Dietary K restriction, sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Resonium), patiromer or SZC if recurrent | ↓K excretion in CKD; monitor closely on ACEI/ARB [14] |
| **Dyslipidaemia** | ***Statins*** | ***Treatment of hyperlipidaemia in patients with ADPKD who have reduced renal function*** [1]; CKD is independent CVD risk factor [14] |
| **CVD risk** | Lifestyle + statins + BP control + aspirin (if indicated) | CKD confers significantly ↑CVD mortality [14] |
| **Fluid overload** | Salt restriction + loop diuretics (furosemide) ± thiazide (metolazone) | Only in later CKD when fluid retention occurs [14] |

---

#### B6. Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT)

When ADPKD progresses to ESRD (eGFR < 10–15 or symptomatic uraemia), RRT is required. [1][14]

| Modality | Suitability in ADPKD | Key Considerations |
|---|---|---|
| ***Haemodialysis (HD)*** | Generally preferred over PD in ADPKD | Standard vascular access (AV fistula preferred). Allow more control over dialysis parameters [14] |
| ***Peritoneal dialysis (PD)*** | ***Less commonly performed in ADPKD*** | ***Difficult for patients to accommodate large volumes of dialysate fluid in the setting of enlarged kidneys; increased risk of peritonitis secondary to cyst infection; and risk of abdominal hernia*** [1]. However, PD is still feasible in many ADPKD patients, especially if kidney size is moderate. In HK, the "PD-first" policy means PD is often tried first. [14] |
| ***Renal transplantation*** | ***Treatment of choice*** — offers best quality of life, survival, and is most cost-effective [1][14] | ***Patients with very large polycystic kidneys and recurrent renal cyst infection may require pre-transplant nephrectomy or bilateral nephrectomy to accommodate the allograft and reduce pain*** [1]. ***Patients should be screened for presence of intracranial aneurysm before surgery due to possible haemodynamic instability*** [1]. |

**Timing of RRT initiation:** [14]
- Begin discussions at eGFR ~20–30 mL/min → allow preparation
- Consider living donor pre-emptive transplantation if eGFR < 20 with evidence of progressive irreversible CKD over 6–12 months
- Initiate RRT when symptomatic: uraemic serositis, uncontrollable volume/BP, progressive malnutrition, cognitive impairment

**Indications for RRT in AKI (AEIOU):** [14]
- **A** = Acidosis (refractory metabolic acidosis pH < 7.1, HCO₃ < 10)
- **E** = Electrolyte (hyperkalaemia > 6.5 refractory to medical Rx)
- **I** = Intoxication
- **O** = Overload (fluid overload refractory to diuretics)
- **U** = Uraemia (pericarditis, encephalopathy)

---

#### B7. Management of Extrarenal Manifestations

##### Intracranial Aneurysm (ICA)

***Ruptured cerebral aneurysm resulting in subarachnoid or intracerebral haemorrhage is the MOST serious complication of PKD.*** [1]

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Screening** | ***CTA or MRA is offered to high-risk patients: those with previous rupture, positive family history of aneurysm, high occupational risk, and patients requiring chronic anticoagulation*** [1] |
| ***Small asymptomatic aneurysm < 7 mm (Asian < 5 mm)*** | ***Generally requires observation only without intervention due to low risk of haemorrhage*** [1] |
| ***Asymptomatic aneurysm ≥ 7–10 mm (Asian ≥ 5 mm)*** | ***Warrants strong consideration for treatment taking into account patient's age, existing medical and neurological conditions, and risks of treatment*** [1] |
| ***Large symptomatic aneurysm*** | ***Requires treatment and is cost-effective*** [1] |
| **Treatment options** | Microsurgical clipping or endovascular coiling/stenting (same as for aneurysms in non-ADPKD patients) |

##### Polycystic Liver Disease

| Approach | Indication |
|---|---|
| **Observation** | Asymptomatic (most patients) — liver function is typically preserved even with massive cysts |
| **Cyst aspiration + sclerotherapy** | Dominant symptomatic cyst |
| **Fenestration (laparoscopic or open)** | Multiple symptomatic superficial cysts |
| **Hepatic resection** | Massive cystic disease confined to one lobe with preserved contralateral liver |
| **Liver transplantation** | Severe PLD with incapacitating symptoms, malnutrition, or combined liver-kidney transplant in ESRD |
| **Somatostatin analogues (octreotide/lanreotide)** | Reduces hepatic cyst growth in RCTs; reduces liver volume by 3–6% over 6–12 months; considered for patients with severe PLD not amenable to surgery |
| **Avoid oestrogens** | OCP and HRT exacerbate hepatic cyst growth (hepatic cysts have oestrogen receptors) |

##### Cardiac Valve Disease

***MOST common abnormalities include MVP and aortic regurgitation (AR).*** ***Less frequent lesions include tricuspid valve prolapse (TVP), MR and TR.*** [1]

| Approach | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Echocardiographic surveillance** | Baseline + as clinically indicated |
| **Endocarditis prophylaxis** | Standard indications (generally NOT required for MVP without regurgitation in current guidelines) |
| **Valve surgery** | Only if haemodynamically significant (severe MR, severe AR with LV dilatation) |

---

### C. Summary Table: Management by Disease Stage

| Stage | eGFR | Key Interventions |
|---|---|---|
| **At-risk (pre-symptomatic)** | Normal | Genetic counselling, screening USG, lifestyle advice, avoid nephrotoxins |
| **Early ADPKD** | > 60 | Intensive BP control (< 110/75 if young), ACEI/ARB, lifestyle, assess for tolvaptan eligibility (Mayo 1C–1E), ICA screening if FHx |
| **Moderate CKD** | 30–60 | Tolvaptan if eligible, ACEI/ARB, manage CKD complications (anaemia, CKD-MBD), statin, less aggressive BP target (< 140/90) |
| **Advanced CKD** | 15–30 | Continue above, begin RRT planning, referral to nephrologist, consider pre-emptive transplant evaluation |
| **ESRD** | < 10–15 | RRT: HD (preferred over PD in ADPKD), transplantation (treatment of choice). Pre-transplant nephrectomy if indicated. Screen for ICA before transplant. |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Management of ADPKD">

1. **Non-pharmacological**: Na restriction < 2 g/day, ↑fluid intake (suppresses vasopressin → ↓cAMP → ↓cyst growth), avoid caffeine, exercise, weight control.
2. **BP control**: ACEI first-line (RAAS-driven HTN); target < 110/75 in young patients with eGFR > 60 (HALT-PKD); < 140/90 in moderate-advanced CKD (avoid hypoperfusion).
3. **Tolvaptan**: V2 receptor antagonist, the only disease-modifying therapy. Slows TKV growth and GFR decline. For rapidly progressive disease (Mayo 1C-1E). Main side effects: polyuria, hepatotoxicity. Monitor LFTs monthly × 18 months.
4. **Cyst infection**: lipid-soluble antibiotics (fluoroquinolones/cotrimoxazole) × 4–6 weeks (because water-soluble drugs cannot penetrate cyst wall).
