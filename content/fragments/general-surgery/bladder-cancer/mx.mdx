## Management of Bladder Cancer

### Overarching Principles

The entire management of bladder cancer pivots on **one question**: Has the tumour invaded the **muscularis propria (detrusor muscle)**?

- **NMIBC (Tis, Ta, T1)** → manage with TURBT ± intravesical therapy + lifelong surveillance
- **MIBC (≥ T2, up to T4a)** → radical cystectomy ± neoadjuvant chemotherapy (or bladder-preserving multimodality therapy)
- **Metastatic / unresectable (T4b or M1)** → systemic therapy (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy)

A second universal principle: ***Smoking cessation for ALL patients*** [3] — smoking is the #1 risk factor and continued smoking increases recurrence, progression, and mortality even after treatment.

## 1. Management of Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC)

NMIBC accounts for ~70–80% of bladder cancers at presentation [3]. The approach is: **TURBT (curative intent) → risk stratify → adjuvant intravesical therapy → lifelong surveillance**.

### 1.1 TURBT — The Foundation of NMIBC Treatment [1][2][3][4]

TURBT is simultaneously diagnostic, staging, and therapeutic for NMIBC. (The procedure details were covered in the Diagnostics section; here we focus on its therapeutic role.)

| Aspect | Detail |
|:-------|:-------|
| **Goal** | Complete, visible resection of ALL tumour tissue + underlying detrusor muscle |
| **Curative potential** | TURBT alone can be curative for NMIBC if complete resection is achieved [2][3] |
| **Technique** | En-bloc for small exophytic lesions; piecemeal for larger ones [3] |
| **Must include** | Muscularis propria in the specimen — to determine if invasion is present [3] |
| **Adjunct** | Fluorescence-guided resection (blue-light cystoscopy) for better tumour detection [3] |

#### ***Immediate Post-operative Intravesical Mitomycin C*** [1][2][3][4]

***Staging TURBT + immediate post-op instillation of mitomycin C (reduce tumour cells implantation and recurrence)*** [4]

| Property | Detail |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Drug** | Mitomycin C (MMC) — "mito-" = thread (refers to DNA crosslinking) |
| **Class** | Cytotoxic alkylating agent — directly crosslinks DNA → prevents cell replication → kills residual cancer cells [2] |
| **Timing** | ***Immediate post-op*** — ideally within 6–24 hours of TURBT [3] |
| **Mechanism of benefit** | Tumour cells are shed during TURBT and can **implant** on the raw, denuded urothelium. Immediate MMC kills these free-floating cells before implantation occurs [4] |
| **Effect** | ***Reduces recurrence*** by ~30% [3] — but does ***NOT reduce progression rate*** (cf. BCG) [2] |
| **Indication** | Low risk and intermediate risk NMIBC; also given empirically in all NMIBC if no contraindication [1][3] |
| **Contraindication** | Suspected or confirmed muscle invasion (do NOT give if MIBC likely — wait for histology); suspected bladder perforation |
| **Side effects** | Chemical cystitis, skin rash [1][2] |

<Callout title="Why Mitomycin C Immediately, Not BCG?" type="idea">
***Immediate post-op BCG is contraindicated*** because BCG is a **live attenuated organism** (Mycobacterium bovis). If instilled into a freshly resected, raw bladder, it can enter the bloodstream through exposed vessels → **BCG sepsis** (a life-threatening systemic mycobacterial infection). Mitomycin C, being a chemical agent, does not carry this risk [2].
</Callout>

#### ***2nd Look TURBT (Restaging TURBT)*** [2][3][4]

***Performed 4–6 weeks after initial staging TURBT*** [4]

***Indications*** [4]:
1. ***High-grade / CIS: significant risk of upstaging***
2. ***Absence of detrusor muscle in initial TURBT specimen***
3. ***Incomplete initial resection***

**Why?** Residual disease is found in **20–30%** of cases who had apparently "complete resection" at the first TURBT [2]. Understaging a T2 tumour as T1 → patient receives BCG instead of radical cystectomy → disease progresses → poor outcome.

---

### 1.2 Risk Stratification of NMIBC [1][3]

After TURBT, pathology determines the risk group, which dictates adjuvant treatment:

| Risk Group | Definition | Risk of Progression | Recommended Treatment |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| **Low** | ***Primary, solitary, low-grade Ta, < 3 cm, no CIS*** [1][3] | 0–4% | ***TURBT + single immediate post-op intravesical MMC*** [1][3] |
| **Intermediate** | All tumours not meeting low or high risk criteria [1] | 10–15% | TURBT + post-op MMC + ***1 year full-dose intravesical BCG*** or chemotherapy [1][3] |
| **High** | ***ANY of: T1, high-grade Ta, CIS, or multiple + recurrent + > 3 cm low-grade tumour*** [1][3] | 30–40% | TURBT + post-op MMC + ***2nd look TURBT*** + ***intravesical BCG × 1–3 years***; ***consider radical cystectomy if very high risk*** [1][3] |
| **BCG-refractory** | Tumour recurs/persists despite adequate BCG | Very high | ***Radical cystectomy*** (or bladder-preserving strategies if unfit) [3] |

---

### 1.3 Intravesical Therapy — BCG vs Chemotherapy

#### A. ***Intravesical BCG (Bacillus Calmette–Guérin)*** [1][2][3][4]

***Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG): given 4–6 weeks after staging TURBT for high-risk NMIBC to reduce risk of recurrence and progression*** [4]

BCG is one of the most fascinating treatments in oncology — a tuberculosis vaccine repurposed as cancer immunotherapy.

| Property | Detail |
|:---------|:-------|
| **What is it?** | ***Live attenuated vaccine*** made from Mycobacterium bovis [1][2] |
| **Mechanism** | ***Triggers non-specific cytokine-mediated local immune response*** [1] — BCG organisms attach to the urothelium → internalized by urothelial cells → presented to immune cells → massive influx of CD4+ T cells, macrophages, NK cells → cytokine storm (IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ) → immune-mediated destruction of residual cancer cells + increased tumour antigen expression [5] |
| **Route** | Instillation of BCG + normal saline into bladder via urethral catheter → retained for 2 hours → voided [3] |
| **Timing** | Started ***≥ 2–3 weeks (4–6 weeks per lecture slides) after TURBT*** [3][4] — must allow mucosal healing to prevent systemic absorption |
| **Regimen (Induction)** | ***Weekly × 6 weeks*** (Lamm's induction) [1][2][3] |
| **Regimen (Maintenance)** | ***Weekly × 3 weeks*** at 3, 6, 12 months (intermediate risk — total 1 year) [1][2] |
| | Weekly × 3 weeks at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 months (high risk — total 3 years) [1][3] |
| | ***PWH regimen***: induction (weekly × 6) + maintenance (weekly × 3 at 3mo, × 3 at 6mo, × 3 at 12mo) — 15 doses for 1 year total [2] |
| **Effect** | ***Reduces both recurrence AND progression rate*** (4–27% reduction in progression) [2][3] — this is the key difference from MMC, which reduces recurrence only |
| **Indication** | ***First-line treatment for CIS*** [2]; high-risk and intermediate-risk NMIBC |

**Contraindications for BCG** [3]:
- < 2 weeks after TURBT (mucosal not healed → risk of systemic absorption)
- Gross haematuria (raw surface → BCG enters bloodstream)
- After traumatic catheterisation
- Symptomatic UTI (active infection → immunocompromised state)
- Immunosuppressed patients (live vaccine)

**Side effects** [1][3]:
| Category | Side Effect | Mechanism |
|:---------|:-----------|:----------|
| **Local** | Cystitis (frequency, urgency, dysuria), prostatitis, epididymo-orchitis | Local inflammatory response to BCG organisms |
| **Systemic** | ***BCG sepsis***, pneumonitis, hepatitis, arthritis, fever, malaise | Systemic dissemination of live organisms or systemic immune activation |

**Management of BCG complications**: Localized symptoms usually self-limiting; systemic BCG sepsis is a medical emergency → treat with ***anti-TB drugs*** (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol) + corticosteroids [2][3].

<Callout title="BCG Compliance Issue" type="error">
The maintenance regimen is ***troublesome*** — 15 doses over 1 year (PWH) or up to 27 doses over 3 years (full EAU). Compliance is a significant problem. Patients often drop out due to irritative symptoms. Counsel patients carefully about the importance of completing the course — incomplete BCG is associated with higher recurrence and progression [2].
</Callout>

#### B. Intravesical Chemotherapy — Mitomycin C (MMC) [1][2][3]

| Property | Detail |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Drug** | Mitomycin C (most common); gemcitabine (alternative) |
| **Mechanism** | Alkylating agent → DNA crosslinking → direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells |
| **Single post-op instillation** | Standard for low-risk NMIBC; given within 6–24h of TURBT |
| **Maintenance therapy** | For 1 year in intermediate-risk NMIBC (rarely done in HK) [3] |
| **Effect** | Reduces **recurrence** but NOT progression (unlike BCG) [2] |
| **Side effects** | Chemical cystitis, palmar rash (contact dermatitis) [1][2] |

#### BCG vs MMC — Key Comparison

| Feature | **BCG** | **Mitomycin C** |
|:--------|:--------|:---------------|
| Mechanism | Immunotherapy (immune activation) | Chemotherapy (direct cytotoxicity) |
| Reduces recurrence | Yes | Yes |
| Reduces progression | ***Yes*** | ***No*** |
| Use for CIS | ***First-line*** | Not first-line |
| Timing after TURBT | ≥ 2–6 weeks (mucosal healing needed) | Immediate (within 24h) |
| Side effects | Irritative LUTS, BCG sepsis risk | Chemical cystitis, rash |
| Compliance | Poor (long regimen) | Better (single dose or short course) |

---

### 1.4 Surveillance After NMIBC Treatment [2][3]

Bladder cancer has a notorious **70% lifetime risk of tumour recurrence** [3]. Surveillance is lifelong.

| Risk Group | ***Surveillance Cystoscopy*** Schedule | Additional |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------|:-----------|
| **Low risk** | 3 months, 12 months, then ***yearly × 5 years*** [2] | — |
| **High risk** | ***Every 3 months × 2 years, then every 6 months × 3 years, then yearly*** (can be lifelong) [2] | + ***Yearly upper tract imaging (CTU) + urine cytology*** [2] |

**Why lifelong surveillance?** Field cancerisation means new tumours can arise anywhere in the urothelium at any time. A single negative cystoscopy does not mean the patient is cured.

---

## 2. Management of Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC)

MIBC (pT2–T4a) is an aggressive disease — ***> 90% 2-year mortality if untreated*** [3]. However, with appropriate treatment, ***5-year survival > 50% after cystectomy*** [3].

### 2.1 ***Radical Cystectomy (RC)*** — Gold Standard for MIBC [2][3][4]

***Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + Radical cystectomy: open / laparoscopic / robotic*** [4]

#### What Is Removed?

***Radical cystectomy: bladder + bilateral pelvic LN dissection (external iliac, internal iliac, obturator nodes) + adjacent organs*** [2]

| Sex | Structures Removed |
|:----|:-------------------|
| **Male** | ***Bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles ± urethra*** (cystoprostatectomy) + regional LNs [2][3] |
| **Female** | ***Bladder, uterus, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (HBSO), part of vagina ± urethra*** (anterior exenteration) + distal ureters + regional LNs [2][3] |

**Why pelvic lymph node dissection?** ***Pelvic LN dissection offers survival benefit*** (cf. CA prostate where LND benefit is debatable) because ***microscopic metastasis is common*** in bladder cancer [2]. Extended LND (up to common iliac and presacral nodes) improves staging accuracy and may improve survival.

#### Indications [3]
- ***Very high-risk NMIBC*** (BCG-refractory, T1HG with multiple adverse features)
- ***Resectable MIBC: T2–T4a*** [3]

#### Contraindications / Not Candidates
- ***T4b (pelvic wall or abdominal wall invasion)*** — this is **unresectable** [3]
- Medically unfit for major surgery (significant cardiac, pulmonary, or other comorbidities)
- Patient declines surgery (offer bladder-preserving alternatives)

#### Surgical Techniques [3]
| Technique | Detail |
|:----------|:-------|
| ***Open*** | Traditional approach; best established evidence |
| ***Laparoscopic*** | Less blood loss, faster recovery; similar oncological outcomes |
| ***Robotic*** | Increasingly used; ergonomic advantages for surgeon; similar oncological outcomes in experienced centres |

#### ***Sexual-Preserving Techniques*** [3]
In carefully selected individuals (organ-confined disease without tumour in prostate, urethra, or bladder neck):
- **Males**: prostate-sparing, capsule-sparing, seminal vesicle–sparing, nerve-sparing cystectomy
- **Females**: preservation of neurovascular bundle, vagina, or uterus
- These reduce sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence but must not compromise oncological safety

---

### 2.2 Urinary Diversion After Radical Cystectomy [3]

Once the bladder is removed, urine must be diverted. There are two broad categories:

#### A. Incontinent Diversion (Urine drains to an external stoma/bag)

| Type | Description | Pros / Cons |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|
| **Ureterocutaneostomy** | Ureters brought directly to abdominal wall surface | Simple; but ↓calibre of ureters → ↑risk of stenosis [3] |
| ***Ileal conduit*** (most common in HK) [3] | Ureters implanted into a short isolated segment (~15–20 cm) of **ileum** (or colon) → brought to abdominal surface as a **stoma** | ***Majority of urinary diversions in HK*** [3]; lower risk of ureteroileal stricture than ureterocutaneostomy; requires external urostomy bag |

#### B. Continent Diversion (Urine stored internally)

| Type | Description | Pros / Cons |
|:-----|:-----------|:-----------|
| **Continent cutaneous reservoir (e.g., Indiana pouch)** | Bowel segment fashioned into an internal reservoir → catheterisable stoma on abdominal wall | No external bag; requires self-catheterisation every 4–6 hours |
| **Orthotopic neobladder (e.g., Studer, Hautmann)** | Bowel segment fashioned into a reservoir → anastomosed to the **urethra** | Most physiological — patient voids via the urethra; requires intact external sphincter and no tumour at urethra/bladder neck; risk of nocturnal incontinence (neobladder lacks detrusor contraction — voiding by Valsalva/abdominal straining) |

<Callout title="Why Use Bowel for Urinary Diversion?">
Bowel is the only readily available tubular tissue in the body that can be refashioned into a conduit or reservoir. Ileum is most commonly used because it has a reliable mesentery, is relatively easy to mobilize, and produces less mucus than colon. However, using bowel for urinary diversion can cause metabolic complications: **hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis** (bowel mucosa reabsorbs Cl⁻ and NH₄⁺ from urine, exchanges for HCO₃⁻) and **vitamin B12 deficiency** (terminal ileum is the site of B12 absorption — resection removes this).
</Callout>

---

### 2.3 Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Chemotherapy [3][4]

#### ***Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy*** [3][4]

***Neoadjuvant chemotherapy + Radical cystectomy*** [4]

| Property | Detail |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Regimen** | ***Cisplatin-based combination*** therapy (e.g., GC = gemcitabine + cisplatin; MVAC = methotrexate + vinblastine + doxorubicin + cisplatin; PGC = paclitaxel + gemcitabine + cisplatin) [3] |
| **Timing** | Given **before** radical cystectomy (typically 3–4 cycles) |
| **Rationale** | (1) Downstage the tumour → improve resectability; (2) Treat micrometastatic disease early (before surgery selects for resistant clones); (3) Patients tolerate chemo better pre-op than post-op (better renal function, better performance status) |
| **Indication** | ***Recommended for all patients undergoing curative RC*** [3] |
| **Survival benefit** | ~5% absolute improvement in 5-year overall survival |
| **Prerequisite** | Adequate renal function (cisplatin is nephrotoxic — requires GFR > 60 mL/min); if cisplatin-ineligible, role of neoadjuvant chemo is less clear |

#### Adjuvant Chemotherapy [3]

| Property | Detail |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Timing** | Given **after** radical cystectomy |
| **Indication** | ***Role unclear*** — may be offered to ***pT3+ or N1+ patients who did NOT receive neoadjuvant therapy*** [3] |
| **Rationale** | Treats residual micrometastatic disease identified on final pathology |
| **Limitation** | Post-operative renal function may be impaired (single kidney with ureteric reimplantation); patients may not tolerate cisplatin post-op |

---

### 2.4 ***Bladder-Preserving (Combined Modality) Therapy*** [3][4]

***Radiotherapy for frail patient not fit for surgery*** [4]

This is the alternative to radical cystectomy for patients who wish to keep their bladder or who are unfit for major surgery.

| Property | Detail |
|:---------|:-------|
| **Components** | ***Maximal TURBT*** (resect ALL visible tumour) + ***chemoradiation*** with platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin, or mitomycin C + 5-FU) [3] |
| **Also called** | Trimodality therapy (TMT) = maximal TURBT + chemotherapy + radiation |
| **Indications** [3] | (1) Alternative to RC in selected, well-informed patients who wish to preserve sexual function / bladder; (2) In place of RC in patients with significant comorbidities where RC is not an option |
| **Prefer RC over TMT if** [3] | Presence of CIS (diffuse field disease → poor response to RT); upper tract obstruction (suggests advanced local disease); IBD (radiation contraindicated); severe storage LUTS; previous extensive pelvic surgery or RT |
| **Outcome** | ***5-year overall survival 36–74%*** (inferior to RC, but no direct RCT comparison exists) [3] |

**Why is it inferior?** Radiation cannot adequately treat microscopic disease throughout the entire urothelium (field cancerisation), and residual CIS/multifocal disease in the bladder remnant leads to local recurrence. However, it preserves quality of life (no stoma, preserved sexual function).

---

## 3. Management of Metastatic / Unresectable Bladder Cancer [1][3][4]

Metastatic bladder cancer (any T, N+, M1) or unresectable disease (T4b) is incurable with surgery alone. Management is **systemic**.

### ***Systemic Chemotherapy (1st Line)*** [1][3][4]

***Systemic chemotherapy: cisplatin or carboplatin-based*** [4]

| Regimen | Components | Notes |
|:--------|:-----------|:------|
| ***GC*** | Gemcitabine + Cisplatin | Most commonly used first-line; better tolerated than MVAC [3] |
| ***MVAC*** | Methotrexate + Vinblastine + Doxorubicin + Cisplatin | Historical standard; higher toxicity; ± G-CSF support [3] |
| ***PGC*** | Paclitaxel + Gemcitabine + Cisplatin | Triplet; used in selected fit patients [3] |
| **Carboplatin-based** | Gemcitabine + Carboplatin | For ***cisplatin-ineligible*** patients (GFR < 60, poor performance status, hearing loss, neuropathy, heart failure) [3] |

- ***Urothelial bladder cancer is most sensitive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy*** [1]
- ***Platinum-based chemotherapy is the preferred initial approach for systemic therapy in patients with metastatic disease*** [1]

### ***Immunotherapy (2nd Line)*** [3][4]

***Immunotherapy: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab)*** [4]

| Agent | Target | Notes |
|:------|:-------|:------|
| ***Pembrolizumab*** | PD-1 inhibitor | FDA-approved for platinum-refractory advanced urothelial CA; also first-line for cisplatin-ineligible patients with PD-L1 high expression [3][4] |
| **Atezolizumab** | PD-L1 inhibitor | Second-line after platinum failure [3] |
| **Nivolumab** | PD-1 inhibitor | Adjuvant setting post-RC for high-risk MIBC (EAU 2024); also second-line metastatic |
| **Avelumab** | PD-L1 inhibitor | Maintenance after first-line platinum-based chemo (switch maintenance strategy) — significant survival benefit |

**Why do checkpoint inhibitors work in bladder cancer?** Urothelial carcinoma has a high tumour mutational burden (TMB) — due to carcinogen exposure (smoking, chemicals) → many neoantigens → but the tumour upregulates PD-L1 to evade immune detection. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 "releases the brakes" on T-cell-mediated anti-tumour immunity.

### ***Targeted Therapy*** [4]

***Target therapy: FGFR inhibitors are used for specific genetic alterations*** [4]

| Agent | Target | Indication |
|:------|:-------|:-----------|
| ***Erdafitinib*** | FGFR2/3 inhibitor | For patients with **FGFR3 mutations or FGFR2/3 fusions** — typically in the low-grade papillary pathway; used in platinum-refractory setting [4] |

**Why FGFR?** Recall from the molecular pathogenesis section: the low-grade papillary pathway is driven by **FGFR3 activating mutations** (~70% of low-grade tumours). Erdafitinib directly inhibits this driver → tumour regression. This is a classic example of **precision oncology**.

### Other Agents [3]

| Agent | Role |
|:------|:-----|
| **Vinflunine** | 2nd-line chemotherapy (approved in Europe, rarely used) |
| **Enfortumab vedotin** | Antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4; approved for platinum- and IO-refractory urothelial CA (3rd line); significant survival benefit |
| **Sacituzumab govitecan** | Antibody-drug conjugate targeting Trop-2; emerging evidence |

---

## 4. Prognosis Summary [3]

| Stage | Prognosis |
|:------|:----------|
| **NMIBC** | 10–20% progress to MIBC; ***70% lifetime risk of tumour recurrence*** → lifelong surveillance mandatory |
| **MIBC (untreated)** | ***> 90% 2-year mortality*** |
| **MIBC (after cystectomy)** | ***5-year survival > 50%*** |
| **Metastatic (1st-line chemo)** | Median survival ~14–15 months; improved with immunotherapy maintenance |

---

## 5. Summary: Treatment by Stage

| Stage | Treatment |
|:------|:----------|
| ***Low-risk NMIBC*** | TURBT + single immediate post-op MMC [1][3][4] |
| ***Intermediate-risk NMIBC*** | TURBT + post-op MMC + 1-year intravesical BCG or chemo [1][3] |
| ***High-risk NMIBC*** | TURBT + post-op MMC + ***2nd look TURBT*** + intravesical BCG × 1–3 years; consider RC if very high risk [1][3][4] |
| ***CIS (first-line)*** | Intravesical BCG (first-line treatment for CIS) [2] |
| ***BCG-refractory*** | Radical cystectomy [3] |
| ***MIBC (T2–T4a)*** | ***Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemo + radical cystectomy + pelvic LND + urinary diversion*** [3][4] |
| ***MIBC (unfit for surgery)*** | ***Bladder-preserving: maximal TURBT + chemoradiation*** [3][4] |
| ***Metastatic*** | ***1st line: cisplatin/carboplatin-based chemo → maintenance avelumab; 2nd line: pembrolizumab/atezolizumab; FGFR inhibitors if FGFR-altered*** [3][4] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**NMIBC Management (Tis/Ta/T1)**:
- TURBT is the cornerstone — diagnostic, staging, AND therapeutic
- ***Immediate post-op intravesical mitomycin C*** for ALL NMIBC (reduces recurrence by ~30%, NOT progression; immediate because it prevents tumour cell implantation)
- Risk stratify: Low → MMC only; Intermediate → BCG or chemo × 1 year; High → BCG × 1–3 years ± 2nd look TURBT ± radical cystectomy
- ***BCG is first-line for CIS*** and reduces BOTH recurrence AND progression (unlike MMC which only reduces recurrence)
- BCG is a live attenuated vaccine (M. bovis) → NEVER give immediately post-TURBT (risk of BCG sepsis)
- BCG regimen: induction weekly × 6 → maintenance weekly × 3 at regular intervals
- BCG side effects: irritative LUTS (local), BCG sepsis (systemic) → treat with anti-TB drugs
- ***2nd look TURBT at 4–6 weeks*** if: (1) high-grade/CIS, (2) no detrusor in specimen, (3) incomplete resection
- Surveillance is LIFELONG: field cancerisation → 70% lifetime recurrence risk

**MIBC Management (T2–T4a)**:
- ***Neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemo + Radical cystectomy*** (open/lap/robotic) + pelvic LND + urinary diversion (most commonly ileal conduit in HK)
- RC removes: M — bladder + prostate + seminal vesicles ± urethra; F — bladder + uterus + HBSO + part of vagina ± urethra
- Pelvic LND provides survival benefit (microscopic mets common)
- Bladder-preserving TMT (maximal TURBT + chemoRT) for unfit/patient preference

**Metastatic (T4b/M1)**:
- ***1st line: cisplatin-based chemo (GC or MVAC)***; carboplatin if cisplatin-ineligible
- ***2nd line: immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, atezolizumab)***
- ***Targeted: FGFR inhibitors (erdafitinib) for FGFR-altered tumours***
- Maintenance avelumab after 1st-line chemo
- Antibody-drug conjugates (enfortumab vedotin) for refractory disease

**T4b = unresectable** (pelvic wall/abdominal wall invasion)
