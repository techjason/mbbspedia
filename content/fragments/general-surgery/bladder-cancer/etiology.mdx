# Bladder Cancer

## 1. Definition

Bladder cancer refers to any malignant neoplasm arising from the tissues of the urinary bladder. The vast majority (~90%) originate from the **urothelium** (the transitional cell epithelium lining the bladder lumen), and are therefore termed **urothelial carcinoma (UC)** — previously known as **transitional cell carcinoma (TCC)** [1][2][3].

The name itself tells you the key concept:
- "Uro-" = urine/urinary system
- "-thelial" = epithelium
- "Carcinoma" = malignant tumour of epithelial origin

The single most important conceptual division in bladder cancer is whether the tumour has invaded the **muscularis propria (detrusor muscle)** or not, because this fundamentally changes prognosis and management [2][4].

> **High Yield:** The critical question in bladder cancer is always: **"Is it muscle-invasive or not?"** This dictates whether you can manage conservatively (TURBT ± intravesical therapy) or need radical surgery.

## 2. Epidemiology

### Global
- ***9th most common cancer in the world*** [3][1]
- Incidence varies enormously by geography — highest in Southern/Western Europe and North America, lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (except where schistosomiasis is endemic)

### Hong Kong
- ***Incidence: ~5.8 per 100,000 per year; Mortality: ~2.7 per 100,000 per year*** [3]
- ***9th commonest male cancer*** in HK [3]
- Hong Kong has an additional unique risk factor: **aristolochic acid** exposure from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which should always be screened for in the history [3]

### Demographics
- **Male predominance: M:F = 3:1** [1][2][3] — likely due to higher smoking rates and greater occupational chemical exposure in males historically, plus possible hormonal/receptor differences
- ***Median age of diagnosis ≈ 69 years (males), 71 years (females)*** [3]; most sources cite median ~70 years [1]
- ***Caucasians > other ethnicities*** [3]
- **Second most prevalent malignancy after prostate cancer in middle-aged males** [1]

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl">
Presence of otherwise **unexplained haematuria in anyone > 40 years old** indicates urothelial cancer until proven otherwise. The most common cause of gross haematuria in a patient > 50 years old is bladder cancer [5].
</Callout>

### At Presentation [2][3]
- ~75% present with **non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC)** — i.e., superficial disease (Ta, Tis, T1)
- ~25% present with **muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC)** — i.e., ≥T2
- Of NMIBC, recurrence rate is notoriously high (~50–70% recur, ~10–30% progress to MIBC)

## 3. Anatomy and Function

Understanding bladder cancer requires knowing the layers of the bladder wall, because staging is defined by depth of invasion through these layers.

### Bladder Wall Layers (from lumen outward)

| Layer | Description | Staging Relevance |
|:------|:------------|:------------------|
| **Urothelium (transitional epithelium)** | 3–7 cell layers thick; waterproof barrier; stretches as bladder fills | Tis (CIS) and Ta (papillary, non-invasive) |
| **Lamina propria (subepithelial connective tissue)** | Loose connective tissue with blood vessels and nerves; contains the **muscularis mucosae** (a thin, often discontinuous smooth muscle layer — do NOT confuse with muscularis propria!) | T1 (invades lamina propria but NOT muscularis propria) |
| **Muscularis propria (detrusor muscle)** | Thick smooth muscle in 3 layers (inner longitudinal → middle circular → outer longitudinal); responsible for bladder contraction during micturition | T2a (inner half) and T2b (outer half) — **this is the critical boundary** |
| **Perivesical fat (adventitia/serosa)** | Adipose tissue surrounding the bladder; only the superior surface has a peritoneal covering (serosa) | T3 (extends through muscle into perivesical tissue) |
| **Adjacent organs** | Prostate, seminal vesicles, uterus, vagina, pelvic sidewall, abdominal wall | T4 (invades adjacent structures) |

<Callout title="Common Exam Mistake" type="error">
Do NOT confuse the **muscularis mucosae** (a thin, discontinuous muscle layer within the lamina propria) with the **muscularis propria (detrusor)**. T1 tumours invade the lamina propria and may reach the muscularis mucosae, but are still "non-muscle invasive." The term "muscle-invasive" specifically means invasion of the **muscularis propria (detrusor)**.
</Callout>

### Bladder Anatomy — Key Points
- The **trigone** (triangle between the two ureteric orifices and the internal urethral meatus) is a common site for tumours; tumours here can obstruct the ureters, causing hydronephrosis
- The **dome/fundus** is derived from the **urachus** (embryological remnant connecting the bladder apex to the umbilicus via the median umbilical ligament) — adenocarcinoma can arise from urachal remnants here [1][3]
- The bladder receives blood supply from the **superior and inferior vesical arteries** (branches of the internal iliac artery)
- Lymphatic drainage is to the **obturator, internal iliac, external iliac, and presacral lymph nodes** — this is the basis for lymph node dissection at radical cystectomy
- Venous drainage is via the **vesical venous plexus** → internal iliac veins → explains potential for haematogenous spread

### "Field Cancerization" Concept [1][3]
The entire urothelium from the renal pelvis to the urethra is exposed to the same carcinogens (in the urine). This means:
- **Multifocal tumours** are characteristic — a single exposure can produce synchronous or metachronous tumours anywhere along the urinary tract
- Patients with **upper tract urothelial carcinoma (renal pelvis/ureter) have a 17% chance of concurrent bladder cancer** (due to "drop metastasis" — cancer cells shed and seed distally along urine flow) [1]
- Conversely, patients with **bladder cancer have only ~2% chance of upper tract disease** — because urine flows antegradely (downward), seeding is less likely in the retrograde direction [1]
- This is why surveillance of the **entire urothelium** is necessary after any urothelial cancer diagnosis

## 4. Risk Factors and Aetiology

Bladder cancer risk factors are **predominantly environmental** — family history confers only a mild increase in risk, and even that is much more prominent among smokers and early-onset cases [3].

### 4.1 Risk Factors for Urothelial Carcinoma (90% of cases)

#### ***Smoking*** [1][2][3][4]
- ***Most important risk factor*** for bladder cancer
- Confers a **2–5× increased risk**; accounts for **~50% of all bladder cancers** [3]
- Mechanism: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aromatic amines (e.g., 2-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl) in tobacco smoke are absorbed systemically → metabolized in the liver → excreted by the kidneys into urine → prolonged contact with the urothelium → DNA damage → mutations (particularly TP53, RB1, FGFR3) → malignant transformation
- Duration and intensity of smoking both correlate with risk; risk decreases after cessation but never returns to baseline

#### ***Occupational Chemical Exposure*** [1][2][3][4]
- Accounts for **~10–20% of bladder cancers**
- Latency period can be **> 20 years** (this is a classic exam point — a patient retired 25 years ago from a rubber factory can still present with bladder cancer now) [3]
- ***Exposure to aromatic amines and chemicals used in dye, rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries*** [4]
- Specific chemicals: **aniline dyes, benzidine, 2-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl, PAHs, benzene, diesel exhaust**
- ***At-risk occupations:*** textile workers, dye workers, tyre rubber and cable workers, petrol workers, leather workers, shoe manufacturers and cleaners, painters, hairdressers, lorry drivers, metal workers, drill press operators, chemical workers, miners, cement workers, transport operators, excavating-machine operators, rodent exterminators, sewage workers [1][3]

#### Drugs and Toxins
- **Cyclophosphamide**: 9× increased risk with latency < 10 years [3]; its metabolite **acrolein** is directly toxic to the urothelium → also causes haemorrhagic cystitis [1]
  - (This is why **MESNA** — "mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium" — is co-administered with cyclophosphamide; it binds acrolein in urine to neutralize it)
- ***Aristolochic acid in TCM***: a well-recognized carcinogen in Hong Kong — should always be screened in the history [3][5]; causes a characteristic mutational signature (A:T → T:A transversions) and also causes Balkan endemic nephropathy / Chinese herb nephropathy
- **Chronic analgesic abuse** (particularly phenacetin-containing analgesics) [3]
- ***Pelvic radiation therapy*** (for rectal, cervical, prostate, testicular cancers) [1][3] — 2–4× risk, latency 5–10 years

#### Prior Urological Conditions
- **Upper tract urothelial carcinoma**: field cancerization concept — the same carcinogen exposure affects the entire urothelium; also "drop metastasis" (cells seed distally) [1]
- **Chronic cystitis**: chronic inflammation → metaplasia → dysplasia → malignancy (more strongly linked to SCC than UCC)
- ***Chronic urinary catheter placement > 10 years***: chronic irritation → squamous metaplasia → SCC [3]
- **HPV infection** [3] — emerging evidence, not as strongly established as in cervical cancer
- **Bladder augmentation**: ~1% risk of CA bladder [3]

#### Family History
- Only a **mild increase** in risk; much more prominent among smokers and early-onset cases [3]
- Rare hereditary syndromes: Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, HNPCC) is associated with upper tract urothelial carcinoma

### 4.2 Risk Factors for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) [1][2][4]

SCC arises from **squamous metaplasia** of the urothelium due to chronic irritation/inflammation. The key risk factors are:

- ***Schistosomiasis*** (Schistosoma haematobium) — endemic in Egypt and other parts of Africa/Middle East [2][4]
  - Mechanism: ova deposited in the bladder wall → granulomatous inflammation → chronic cystitis → squamous metaplasia → dysplasia → SCC
  - ***Common in chronic irritation or schistosomiasis; often presents late with poor prognosis*** [4]
  - Always ask **TOCC** (travel, occupation, contact, cluster) — particularly travel to Egypt [2]
- **Bladder stones**: chronic mechanical irritation → squamous metaplasia → SCC [1][2]
- ***Long-term indwelling catheter use*** [1][2][4]: patients with spinal cord injuries who have long-term indwelling catheters have a **16–20× risk** of developing SCC (**NOT** UCC — because this is chronic irritation-mediated, not carcinogen-mediated) [1]
- ***Chronic bladder irritation and infections*** [4]

### 4.3 Risk Factors for Adenocarcinoma [1][3]

- **Urachal remnants**: the urachus is the embryological connection between the bladder dome and the allantois (umbilicus). Remnant tissue at the bladder dome can undergo malignant transformation → adenocarcinoma arising from the bladder fundus [1][3]
- **Bladder exstrophy**: a rare congenital malformation where the bladder is exposed → chronic irritation → metaplasia → adenocarcinoma [1]
- **Intestinal metaplasia** (e.g., from chronic irritation or following bladder augmentation with bowel segments)
- Should always be distinguished from **secondary (metastatic) adenocarcinoma** from colon, rectum, prostate, or uterine cervix — which are actually the vast majority of adenocarcinomas seen in the bladder [3]

### 4.4 Other Rare Types [4]

- ***Small cell carcinoma: Rare but very aggressive*** [4] — analogous to small cell lung cancer; neuroendocrine origin; often presents with metastatic disease; managed with platinum-based chemotherapy
- ***Sarcomatoid carcinoma: aggressive, poor prognosis*** [4] — biphasic tumour with both epithelial and mesenchymal elements

---

## 5. Pathophysiology

### 5.1 Molecular Pathogenesis — The Two-Pathway Model

Bladder cancer develops along two distinct molecular pathways, which correlate with the clinical behaviour:

| Feature | **Low-Grade Papillary Pathway** | **High-Grade / CIS Pathway** |
|:--------|:-------------------------------|:-----------------------------|
| Initiating mutation | ***FGFR3*** activating mutations (~70%) | ***TP53*** and ***RB1*** loss-of-function mutations |
| Morphology | Papillary (Ta), well-differentiated | Flat (CIS, Tis) or sessile/solid, poorly differentiated |
| Grade | Low-grade (G1/G2 old WHO) | High-grade (G3 old WHO) |
| Behaviour | High recurrence (~50–70%) but **low progression** (~5–15%) | Lower recurrence but **high progression** to muscle-invasion (~50–75%) |
| Clinical stage | Typically remains NMIBC (Ta) | Tends to progress to MIBC (≥T2) |
| Prognosis | Generally good | Poor if untreated |

**Why does this matter clinically?**
- A small, low-grade Ta papillary tumour may recur multiple times but rarely kills the patient — it's a "nuisance" tumour requiring lifelong surveillance
- A CIS (Tis) or high-grade T1 tumour, despite being technically "superficial" (non-muscle invasive), has a high risk of progression to muscle-invasive disease and must be treated aggressively (intravesical BCG or even early radical cystectomy)

### 5.2 Why Painless Haematuria?

Tumour neovascularization creates fragile, abnormal blood vessels on the tumour surface. These bleed into the bladder lumen → blood mixes with urine → painless gross haematuria. There is no stretching of the renal capsule (which causes pain in kidney cancer) and no ureteric obstruction (which causes colic in stones), hence the haematuria is classically **painless** — unless the tumour is advanced enough to invade nerves or obstruct the ureter.

### 5.3 Field Cancerization and Multifocality

The entire urothelium is bathed in carcinogen-containing urine. Genetic damage occurs across wide fields of urothelium simultaneously ("field effect" or "field cancerization"). This explains:
- **Multifocal tumours** (multiple tumours in the bladder at the same time)
- **Pan-urothelial risk** (tumours at renal pelvis, ureter, and bladder)
- **High recurrence rate** (even after complete resection, new tumours arise from other areas of damaged urothelium)
- **Intraluminal seeding** (tumour cells shed into urine and implant at distant urothelial sites) [1]

### 5.4 Metastatic Spread

- **Direct extension**: into perivesical fat → adjacent organs (prostate, uterus, vagina, pelvic sidewall)
- **Lymphatic spread**: to obturator → internal iliac → external iliac → common iliac → para-aortic nodes
- **Haematogenous spread**: via vesical venous plexus → systemic circulation
  - ***Common sites of metastasis: Liver, Lung, Bone*** [1] (also brain, less commonly)

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 Histological Classification [4]

| Type | Prevalence | Key Features |
|:-----|:-----------|:-------------|
| ***Urothelial Carcinoma (Transitional Cell Carcinoma)*** | ***~90%*** | ***The most common type*** [4] |
| ***Squamous Cell Carcinoma*** | ~5–9% | ***Common in chronic irritation or schistosomiasis; often presents late with poor prognosis*** [4] |
| ***Adenocarcinoma*** | ***Rare*** (~1–2%) | From urachal remnants or metaplasia; must distinguish from secondary tumours [4] |
| ***Small cell carcinoma*** | ***Rare*** | ***But very aggressive*** [4]; neuroendocrine differentiation |
| ***Sarcomatoid carcinoma*** | Very rare | ***Aggressive, poor prognosis*** [4]; biphasic morphology |
| Non-epithelial | Very rare | Sarcoma, carcinosarcoma, paraganglioma, melanoma, lymphoma [3] |
| Secondary (metastatic) | Variable | From colon, rectum, prostate, uterine cervix [3] |

### 6.2 WHO Histological Grading

| 2004/2016 WHO Classification | 1973 WHO Classification | Clinical Significance |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------|
| **PUNLMP** (Papillary Urothelial Neoplasm of Low Malignant Potential) | — | Minimal atypia; very low risk of progression; benign behaviour but needs surveillance |
| **Low-grade urothelial carcinoma** | Grade 1 / Grade 2 | Recurs frequently but rarely progresses to invasion |
| **High-grade urothelial carcinoma** | Grade 2 / Grade 3 | High risk of recurrence AND progression to muscle-invasive disease |

### 6.3 TNM Staging (AJCC 8th Edition, 2017)

**T — Primary Tumour**

| Stage | Description | Category |
|:------|:------------|:---------|
| **Tis** | Carcinoma in situ ("flat" high-grade tumour confined to urothelium) | **NMIBC** |
| **Ta** | Non-invasive papillary carcinoma (confined to urothelium, does NOT invade lamina propria) | **NMIBC** |
| **T1** | Invades subepithelial connective tissue (lamina propria) but NOT muscularis propria | **NMIBC** |
| **T2a** | Invades superficial muscularis propria (inner half of detrusor) | **MIBC** |
| **T2b** | Invades deep muscularis propria (outer half of detrusor) | **MIBC** |
| **T3a** | Microscopically extends beyond muscularis propria into perivesical fat | **MIBC** |
| **T3b** | Macroscopically extends beyond muscularis propria (extravesical mass) | **MIBC** |
| **T4a** | Invades prostate stroma, seminal vesicles, uterus, or vagina | **MIBC** |
| **T4b** | Invades pelvic sidewall or abdominal wall | **MIBC** |

**N — Regional Lymph Nodes**

| Stage | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| N0 | No regional LN metastasis |
| N1 | Single LN in true pelvis (obturator, internal/external iliac, presacral) |
| N2 | Multiple LNs in true pelvis |
| N3 | Common iliac LN metastasis |

**M — Distant Metastasis**

| Stage | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| M0 | No distant metastasis |
| M1a | Non-regional lymph nodes (beyond common iliac) |
| M1b | Other distant metastasis (liver, lung, bone) |

<Callout title="The Most Important Staging Concept">
***Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) = Tis, Ta, T1*** → treated with TURBT ± intravesical therapy; surveillance

***Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) = T2 or above*** → requires radical cystectomy ± neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiation [1][2][3][4]

Muscle-invasive tumours (T2 or above) are **mostly high-grade tumours** [1].
</Callout>

### 6.4 Risk Stratification of NMIBC

NMIBC is further stratified to guide adjuvant treatment decisions:

| Risk Group | Features | Recurrence/Progression Risk |
|:-----------|:---------|:---------------------------|
| **Low risk** | Single, small (< 3 cm), Ta, low-grade, no CIS | Low recurrence, very low progression |
| **Intermediate risk** | Multiple OR recurrent OR large (≥ 3 cm) Ta low-grade, no CIS | Moderate recurrence, low progression |
| **High risk** | Any T1, any high-grade, any CIS, multiple/recurrent/large Ta high-grade | High recurrence, **high progression to MIBC** |

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms

#### A. ***Painless Gross Haematuria*** (presenting symptom in ~90%) [3]
- **The cardinal symptom** of bladder cancer
- ***Typically intermittent and present throughout micturition (bladder in origin)*** [3]
  - Why throughout? Because the tumour is in the bladder — blood mixes with all the urine stored there, so the entire stream is blood-stained (cf. initial stream = urethral, terminal stream = bladder neck/prostatic urethra) [5]
- **Painless** because the tumour grows into the bladder lumen without stretching the capsule or obstructing flow (in early disease). Pain implies invasion of nerves, perivesical tissues, or ureteric obstruction → advanced disease
- ***Risk of bladder CA is ~10–20% in gross haematuria and 2–5% in microscopic haematuria*** [3]
- The haematuria is **intermittent** — patients may have one episode, then nothing for weeks/months, leading to false reassurance. **A single episode of painless gross haematuria in anyone > 40 must be investigated for malignancy** [1][5]
- Clot passage may occur → can cause clot retention (acute urinary retention due to blood clots obstructing the urethra)

> **High Yield:** Most common cause of gross haematuria in a patient > 50 years old is bladder cancer [5].

#### B. ***Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)***
- ***Irritative symptoms (~1/3 of patients): frequency, urgency ± urge incontinence, nocturia*** [2][3]
  - **Why?** The tumour (especially CIS, which is flat and diffuse) irritates the bladder mucosa → stimulates stretch/pain receptors in the detrusor → premature signals of bladder fullness → urgency and frequency
  - ***CIS (carcinoma in situ) classically presents with irritative LUTS rather than haematuria*** — this is a crucial point because CIS is a flat, high-grade lesion that is invisible on standard white-light cystoscopy and may mimic UTI or overactive bladder [3]
  - Nocturia occurs because the irritated bladder cannot tolerate even the normal volumes produced overnight
- **Obstructive symptoms (less common)**: hesitancy, weak stream ± straining, intermittence, terminal dribbling, incomplete voiding [2][3]
  - **Why?** Tumour at the **bladder neck** or obstructing a **ureteric orifice** can physically impede urine flow; large intravesical tumours reduce functional bladder capacity and interfere with detrusor contraction
  - ***Strangury*** (painful, frequent passage of small amounts of urine with a sense of incomplete emptying) can occur with advanced tumours near the bladder neck [3]

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
New-onset irritative LUTS in an older patient that does NOT respond to empirical antibiotic treatment should raise alarm for CIS or bladder cancer. Don't just prescribe antibiotics for "recurrent UTIs" — investigate!
</Callout>

#### C. ***Pain*** [3]
- **Usually indicates at least muscle-invasive disease** — pain is NOT a feature of early bladder cancer
- ***Flank pain***: due to tumour at the ureteric orifice level causing ureteric obstruction → hydronephrosis → capsular stretching of the kidney → loin/flank pain. ***Usually indicates muscle-invasive disease*** [3]
- ***Suprapubic pain***: due to locally advanced tumour directly invading perivesical soft tissues and nerves, or obstructing the bladder outlet [3]
- ***Pain at other sites***: due to metastatic disease (bone pain, abdominal pain from liver metastases, headache from brain metastases)

#### D. ***Constitutional Symptoms*** [2][3]
- Loss of appetite, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, night sweats
- ***Indicates advanced or metastatic disease (poor prognosis)*** [3]
- Why? Tumour cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-6) → systemic inflammatory response → cancer cachexia

#### E. ***Symptoms from Metastases*** [2]
- ***Bone pain*** (vertebral, pelvis, long bones — from osseous metastases)
- ***Right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain / jaundice*** (from liver metastases) [2]
- ***Shortness of breath (SOB)*** (from pulmonary metastases or pleural effusion) [2]

#### F. Symptoms from Local Complications [3]
- ***Pneumaturia*** (air in urine): pathognomonic of **vesicocolic fistula** — tumour erodes through the bladder wall into the adjacent colon/sigmoid [3]
- ***Vaginal leakage of urine (continuous incontinence)***: suggests **vesicovaginal fistula** — tumour erodes into the vagina [3]
- ***Faecaluria*** (faecal matter in urine): also from vesicoenteric fistula
- ***Recurrent UTIs***: tumour surface → bacterial colonization; fistula → enteric organisms in urine

### 7.2 Signs

Physical examination in bladder cancer is often **normal in early disease**. Signs become apparent with advanced or metastatic disease.

#### A. General Examination
- **Cachexia**: muscle wasting, temporal wasting — indicates advanced/metastatic disease (cytokine-mediated catabolism)
- **Pallor**: from chronic haematuria → iron deficiency anaemia, or anaemia of chronic disease
- **Lymphadenopathy**: palpable inguinal or supraclavicular (Virchow's node/left supraclavicular) lymph nodes — indicates lymphatic metastasis

#### B. Abdominal Examination
- **Palpable bladder**: large tumour mass or clot retention causing urinary retention → distended bladder palpable suprapubically
- **Palpable flank/loin mass**: hydronephrotic kidney from ureteric obstruction by the tumour
- **Hepatomegaly**: from hepatic metastases; may be tender, nodular, hard
- **Ascites**: peritoneal carcinomatosis (rare)

#### C. Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) / Bimanual Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA)
- ***Bimanual examination under anaesthesia*** is performed at the time of TURBT to assess:
  - **Bladder mass**: palpable through the rectum (in males) or vagina (in females)
  - **Mobility**: a mobile mass suggests organ-confined disease; a **fixed mass** (adherent to the pelvic sidewall) suggests **T4b disease** (pelvic sidewall invasion) — this is **unresectable**
  - This is a clinical staging technique that helps determine operability

#### D. Lower Limb Examination
- **Unilateral or bilateral lower limb oedema**: from pelvic lymph node metastases compressing the iliac veins → venous obstruction → oedema
- **Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**: malignancy is a hypercoagulable state (Trousseau syndrome — cancer cells produce tissue factor and other procoagulants → activation of coagulation cascade)

## 8. Summary Table: Symptom/Sign → Pathophysiological Basis

| Clinical Feature | Pathophysiological Explanation |
|:----------------|:------------------------------|
| Painless gross haematuria | Tumour neovascularization → fragile vessels bleed into lumen; no nerve/capsule involvement in early disease |
| Throughout-stream haematuria | Blood mixes with entire bladder content (bladder origin) |
| Irritative LUTS (frequency, urgency) | Tumour (esp CIS) irritates bladder mucosa → premature detrusor signals |
| Obstructive LUTS | Tumour at bladder neck or ureteric orifice impedes flow |
| Flank pain | Ureteric obstruction → hydronephrosis → renal capsule stretch |
| Suprapubic pain | Direct perivesical invasion / bladder outlet obstruction |
| Bone pain | Haematogenous metastasis to bone |
| Constitutional symptoms | Tumour cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) → systemic inflammation → cachexia |
| Pneumaturia | Vesicocolic fistula (tumour erodes into colon) |
| Continuous urinary incontinence (vaginal) | Vesicovaginal fistula |
| Pallor | Chronic blood loss → iron deficiency anaemia |
| Lower limb oedema | Pelvic LN metastases → iliac vein compression |
| Fixed pelvic mass on EUA | T4b invasion of pelvic sidewall |
