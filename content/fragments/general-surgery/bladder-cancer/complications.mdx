## Complications of Bladder Cancer

Complications in bladder cancer arise from three distinct sources:
1. **The disease itself** — local progression and distant metastasis
2. **Treatment** — TURBT, intravesical therapy, radical cystectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy
3. **Surveillance burden** — lifelong cystoscopy and its attendant morbidity

Understanding the complications from first principles means asking: "What does the tumour physically do as it grows?" and "What are we damaging when we treat it?"

## 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

### 1.1 Local Complications

| Complication | Mechanism (First Principles) | Clinical Presentation |
|:-------------|:----------------------------|:---------------------|
| ***Hydronephrosis and hydroureter*** [1] | Invasive bladder tumour at or near the ureteric orifice/trigone obstructs the distal ureter → urine cannot drain → back-pressure dilates the ureter and renal pelvis | Flank pain (renal capsule stretch), silent renal impairment (bilateral obstruction → post-renal AKI), palpable loin mass [1][6] |
| **Acute urinary retention** | Large tumour mass or blood clots (from tumour haemorrhage) physically block the bladder neck or urethra | Inability to void, suprapubic pain and distension, overflow incontinence |
| **Chronic haematuria → iron deficiency anaemia** | Persistent bleeding from friable tumour neovasculature → ongoing urinary blood loss → depletes iron stores | Pallor, fatigue, palpitations, exertional dyspnoea [5] |
| ***Vesicocolic fistula → pneumaturia*** [3] | T4a tumour erodes through the bladder wall into the adjacent sigmoid colon/rectum → creates abnormal communication between the bowel and bladder | ***Pneumaturia*** (air in urine — pathognomonic), faecaluria (faecal particles in urine), recurrent polymicrobial UTIs [3] |
| ***Vesicovaginal fistula → incontinence*** [3] | T4a tumour erodes into the vagina → continuous leak of urine through the vagina | Continuous vaginal discharge of urine, irritation, recurrent UTI [3] |
| **Bladder outlet obstruction** | Tumour at bladder neck or encasing the prostatic urethra | Obstructive LUTS (hesitancy, weak stream, incomplete emptying), retention |
| **Recurrent UTI** | Tumour surface serves as nidus for bacterial colonisation; fistulae allow enteric organisms into the bladder; urinary stasis behind obstruction | Dysuria, frequency, fever; polymicrobial infections (especially if fistula) |

<Callout title="Post-Renal AKI from Bladder Cancer">
***Invasive bladder tumours can cause distal ureteral obstruction and secondary hydronephrosis*** [1]. If bilateral (or if the patient has a solitary kidney), this produces **post-renal AKI** — an obstructive uropathy [6]. This is **rapidly reversible** if recognised early and treated with percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) or ureteric stent placement. Prolonged obstruction leads to irreversible tubulointerstitial fibrosis [6].
</Callout>

### 1.2 Metastatic Complications

Common metastatic sites are ***liver, lung, and bone*** [1]. Each site produces characteristic complications:

| Metastatic Site | Complications | Mechanism |
|:----------------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Liver** | RUQ pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly, coagulopathy, liver failure | Tumour deposits replace hepatic parenchyma → biliary obstruction (intrahepatic) → impaired synthetic function |
| **Lung** | Dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, pleural effusion | Parenchymal tumour nodules → ventilation–perfusion mismatch; pleural metastases → exudative effusion |
| **Bone** | Bone pain (vertebral, pelvic, long bones), pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcaemia | Osteolytic destruction by tumour → structural weakening → fracture; osteoclast activation → calcium release |
| **Brain** | Headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, cognitive decline | Mass effect of cerebral metastases → raised intracranial pressure, cortical irritation |
| **Lymph nodes** | Lower limb oedema, DVT, pelvic pain | Bulky pelvic LN metastases compress iliac veins → venous obstruction; compress lumbosacral plexus → pain |

### 1.3 Systemic / Paraneoplastic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:-------------|:----------|
| **Cancer cachexia** | Tumour cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1) → systemic inflammation → protein catabolism, anorexia, weight loss |
| **Venous thromboembolism (DVT/PE)** | Trousseau syndrome — malignancy produces tissue factor + cancer procoagulant → activates coagulation cascade → hypercoagulable state; also venous stasis from pelvic mass/immobility |
| **Anaemia of chronic disease** | Hepcidin upregulation by IL-6 → iron sequestration in macrophages → functional iron deficiency (even without overt bleeding) |

---

## 2. Complications of Treatment

### 2.1 Complications of TURBT [3][4]

***Complication of surgery: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)*** [4]

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:-------------|:----------|:-----------|
| **Bleeding** | Resection of highly vascular tumour bed; raw, denuded bladder surface | Usually self-limiting; continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) with normal saline; rarely requires return to OT for diathermy |
| **Infection / UTI** | Urethral instrumentation breaches mucosal barrier; catheterisation | Prophylactic antibiotics; treat with targeted antibiotics per culture |
| **Incomplete resection / Recurrence** | Piecemeal resection → no histological proof of clear margins; field cancerisation → new tumours at distant urothelial sites | 2nd look TURBT (4–6 weeks); lifelong surveillance cystoscopy |
| **TUR syndrome** | Absorption of **hypotonic irrigation fluid** (glycine 1.5%) through open veins in the resection bed → **dilutional hyponatraemia** + fluid overload | Manifests as: confusion, nausea, bradycardia, hypertension, visual disturbance, seizures. Treat: stop irrigation, fluid restrict, hypertonic saline if severe symptomatic hyponatraemia. Prevention: use bipolar resectoscope (allows normal saline irrigation) |
| **Obturator kick** | Diathermy current applied to **lateral bladder wall** tumours stimulates the nearby **obturator nerve** (L2–L4) → sudden, powerful **adductor spasm** of the ipsilateral leg | ***↑↑ risk of bladder perforation*** [3]. Prevention: use bipolar diathermy (reduces current spread), GA with muscle relaxant (paralyses the adductors), or obturator nerve block |
| **Bladder perforation** | Deep resection through full thickness of bladder wall; exacerbated by obturator kick | Intra-peritoneal perforation → acute abdomen, needs laparotomy; extra-peritoneal → conservative (prolonged catheter drainage). Suspect if irrigant not returning |

<Callout title="TUR Syndrome — The Same Mechanism as TURP">
TUR syndrome in TURBT is identical to TUR syndrome in TURP (transurethral resection of prostate). Both involve absorption of hypotonic irrigation fluid through open veins. The key difference is that TURBT resection beds are usually smaller, so TUR syndrome is less common than in TURP, but it still occurs — especially with prolonged resection times and large tumours.
</Callout>

### 2.2 Complications of Intravesical Therapy

#### A. Intravesical Mitomycin C [1][2]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:-------------|:----------|
| **Chemical cystitis** | Direct cytotoxic effect of the alkylating agent on the normal bladder urothelium → inflammation → frequency, urgency, dysuria [1][2] |
| **Skin rash** (contact dermatitis) | Drug leaks onto perineal skin (via catheter drainage or vulvar contact) → allergic/irritant dermatitis [1][2] |
| **Myelosuppression** (rare) | Systemic absorption through denuded urothelium — unusual because MMC is a large molecule with limited absorption |
| **Bladder contracture** (rare, with repeated doses) | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → reduced bladder capacity |

#### B. Intravesical BCG [1][2][3]

BCG complications are divided into **local** and **systemic**, reflecting whether the live attenuated M. bovis organisms remain confined to the bladder or disseminate.

| Category | Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---------|:------------|:----------|:-----------|
| **Local** | **BCG cystitis** (most common) | Local immune/inflammatory response to BCG organisms on urothelium → frequency, urgency, dysuria, haematuria [1] | Usually self-limiting (48–72h); analgesics, anticholinergics; withhold next BCG dose if severe |
| **Local** | **Granulomatous prostatitis** | BCG organisms spread locally to the prostate via the prostatic ducts → granulomatous inflammation [1] | Anti-TB drugs if symptomatic; usually self-limiting |
| **Local** | **Epididymo-orchitis** | BCG descends via the vas deferens → granulomatous inflammation of epididymis/testis [1] | Anti-TB drugs; may require orchiectomy in severe cases |
| **Systemic** | ***BCG sepsis*** | BCG organisms enter the bloodstream through damaged urothelium (especially if instilled too soon after TURBT, traumatic catheterisation, or during active haematuria) → **disseminated mycobacterial infection** [1] | ***Medical emergency***: anti-TB drugs (isoniazid + rifampicin + ethambutol) + high-dose corticosteroids + ICU support [2] |
| **Systemic** | **Pneumonitis** | Haematogenous spread of BCG to lungs → granulomatous pneumonitis [1] | Anti-TB drugs + steroids |
| **Systemic** | **Hepatitis** | Haematogenous spread → granulomatous hepatitis [1] | Anti-TB drugs + steroids |
| **Systemic** | **Reactive arthritis** | Immune-mediated (not direct infection) — molecular mimicry between mycobacterial antigens and joint antigens → sterile joint inflammation [1] | NSAIDs; steroids if severe |

<Callout title="Preventing BCG Sepsis" type="error">
BCG instillation is **contraindicated** if: < 2 weeks post-TURBT (raw surface), gross haematuria (exposed vessels), traumatic catheterisation (urethral injury), symptomatic UTI (impaired local immunity). Breaking these rules risks **fatal BCG sepsis** [3].
</Callout>

### 2.3 Complications of Radical Cystectomy [2][4]

***Complication of surgery: Radical cystectomy*** [4]

Radical cystectomy is a major operation with significant morbidity (~30–60% overall complication rate) and 1–3% perioperative mortality.

| Category | Complication | Mechanism |
|:---------|:------------|:----------|
| **General surgical** | Bleeding, wound infection, DVT/PE | Major pelvic surgery → extensive raw surface, venous stasis, hypercoagulability |
| **Anastomotic** | ***Anastomotic leakage and stricture*** (bowel anastomosis; ureteric-enteral anastomosis) [2] | Ischaemia at suture line → dehiscence (leakage) or excessive fibrosis (stricture); ureteroileal stricture → hydronephrosis |
| **Lymphatic** | ***Lymphocele*** [2] | Pelvic LN dissection disrupts lymphatic channels → lymph fluid accumulates in the pelvis → cystic collection; may cause DVT (compress iliac veins) or become infected |
| **GI** | ***Post-operative ileus*** [2] | Bowel handling during surgery → temporary paralysis of peristalsis (reflex ileus); aggravated by opioid analgesia |
| **GI** | ***Bowel injury*** [2] | Inadvertent enterotomy during dissection around the bladder/bowel adhesions |
| **GI** | **Small bowel obstruction** | Adhesions from surgery → mechanical obstruction (may present weeks to years later) |
| **Urological** | ***Erectile dysfunction*** [2] | Damage to the **cavernous nerves** (branches of the pelvic plexus S2–S4) running along the posterolateral surface of the prostate → loss of parasympathetic-mediated penile erection. ***Consider nerve-sparing surgery if young + early stage low-grade disease*** [2] |
| **Urological** | ***Urinary stress incontinence*** [2] | Removal of the prostate (which provides passive continence through the prostatic urethra and internal sphincter) → reliance on external sphincter alone → stress incontinence |
| **Urological** | **Residual tumour / recurrence** [2] | Positive surgical margins; micrometastatic disease; field cancerisation → new primary tumours in remaining urothelium (urethra, upper tract) |

### 2.4 Complications of Urinary Diversion

| Complication | Type of Diversion | Mechanism |
|:-------------|:-----------------|:----------|
| **Hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis** | Ileal conduit, neobladder (any bowel segment in contact with urine) | Bowel mucosa actively reabsorbs Cl⁻ and NH₄⁺ from urine and secretes HCO₃⁻ → net gain of acid equivalents → normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Longer contact time (neobladder > conduit) = greater risk |
| **Vitamin B12 deficiency** | If **terminal ileum** is used | Terminal ileum is the exclusive site of B12 absorption; resection → malabsorption → megaloblastic anaemia, peripheral neuropathy (onset typically > 3–5 years post-surgery) |
| **Urinary stasis → recurrent UTI** | Neobladder, continent pouch | Bowel segments cannot contract voluntarily like detrusor → incomplete emptying → urinary stasis → bacterial colonisation [2] |
| **Urinary stone formation** | All types | Mucus production by bowel epithelium → nidus for stone formation; chronic UTI with urease-producing organisms (Proteus) → struvite stones; metabolic acidosis → uric acid stones |
| **Stomal complications** | Ileal conduit, continent pouch | Stenosis (fibrosis of stoma site → obstruction), parastomal hernia (fascial defect around stoma), skin irritation (contact dermatitis from urine) |
| **Ureteroileal stricture** | Ileal conduit, neobladder | Fibrosis at the uretero-enteral anastomosis → obstruction → hydronephrosis → silent renal impairment |
| **Neobladder-specific: nocturnal incontinence** | Orthotopic neobladder | External sphincter relaxes during sleep → urine leaks (neobladder lacks the tonic contraction of detrusor/bladder neck); patients must set alarms for overnight emptying |
| **Neobladder-specific: hypercontinence / retention** | Orthotopic neobladder | Bowel segment mucus + inability to generate coordinated detrusor contraction → patient must Valsalva / strain to void; some need intermittent self-catheterisation |
| **Malignancy at ureterosigmoidostomy site** | Ureterosigmoidostomy (rare, historical) | Mixing of urine and faecal stream → bacterial conversion of urinary nitrates to nitrosamines (carcinogens) → adenocarcinoma at the anastomotic site (latency ~20–30 years) |

### 2.5 Complications of Chemotherapy (Cisplatin-Based)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:-------------|:----------|
| **Nephrotoxicity** | Cisplatin directly damages proximal tubular cells → acute tubular necrosis; requires aggressive hydration and monitoring of GFR; cisplatin-ineligible if GFR < 60 mL/min |
| **Ototoxicity** | Cisplatin damages cochlear hair cells (irreversible) → high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Cisplatin accumulates in dorsal root ganglia → axonal degeneration → "stocking-glove" sensory neuropathy |
| **Myelosuppression** | All cytotoxic agents suppress bone marrow → neutropenia (infection risk), thrombocytopenia (bleeding risk), anaemia |
| **Nausea and vomiting** | Cisplatin is one of the most emetogenic chemotherapy agents → stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone (area postrema) and peripheral 5-HT3 receptors on vagal afferents |
| **Tumour lysis syndrome** (rare) | Rapid tumour cell death → release of intracellular contents (K⁺, PO₄³⁻, uric acid) → hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperuricaemia, hypocalcaemia, AKI |

### 2.6 Complications of Radiotherapy (Pelvic)

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism |
|:-------------|:-------|:----------|
| **Radiation cystitis** | Acute (during/shortly after RT) or late (months–years) | Radiation damages urothelial and submucosal cells → acute inflammation → chronic: endarteritis obliterans → mucosal ischaemia → telangiectasia → haemorrhagic cystitis |
| **Radiation proctitis** | Acute or late | Same mechanism affecting the rectum → diarrhoea, rectal bleeding, tenesmus |
| **Radiation enteritis** | Late | Small bowel within the radiation field → fibrosis → strictures → obstruction, malabsorption |
| **Secondary malignancy** | Very late (years–decades) | Radiation-induced DNA damage in surrounding pelvic tissues → new primary cancers (rectal, uterine, sarcoma) |
| **Sexual dysfunction** | Late | Damage to neurovascular bundles and pudendal vasculature → erectile dysfunction (males), vaginal stenosis/dryness (females) |
| **Pelvic insufficiency fractures** | Late | Radiation-induced bone demineralisation → fragility fractures of sacrum, pubis |

### 2.7 Complications of Immunotherapy (Checkpoint Inhibitors — Pembrolizumab, Atezolizumab)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:-------------|:----------|
| **Immune-related adverse events (irAEs)** | Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 "releases the brakes" on T cells → T cells attack not only tumour but also normal tissues (autoimmune-like) |
| Specific irAEs: colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, thyroiditis/hypothyroidism, hypophysitis, dermatitis, nephritis, myocarditis | Each represents T-cell-mediated inflammation of the respective organ |
| **Management** | Mild: withhold drug, supportive care; Moderate–severe: systemic corticosteroids; Refractory: additional immunosuppression (infliximab, mycophenolate) |

---

## 3. Complications Related to Surveillance

| Complication | Explanation |
|:-------------|:------------|
| **Psychological burden** | Lifelong cystoscopy → chronic anxiety ("cancer surveillance fatigue"); significant impact on quality of life |
| **Cystoscopy-related complications** | UTI (urethral instrumentation), haematuria (biopsy site), urethral trauma/stricture (repeated instrumentation), pain/discomfort |
| **Radiation exposure** | Repeated CT urograms for upper tract surveillance → cumulative radiation dose |
| **Financial burden** | NMIBC is one of the most expensive cancers to manage per patient (from diagnosis to death) due to the sheer volume and duration of surveillance |

---

## 4. Complications of the Disease — Recurrence and Progression

| Complication | Significance |
|:-------------|:-------------|
| **NMIBC recurrence** | ***70% lifetime risk of tumour recurrence*** [3] — this is the defining feature of bladder cancer and the reason for lifelong surveillance |
| **NMIBC progression to MIBC** | 10–20% of NMIBC will progress to MIBC [3]; high-grade T1 and CIS have the highest progression risk (30–40%) [1] |
| **Metachronous upper tract tumours** | Field cancerisation → ***secondary primary tumours can develop in urothelium anywhere along the urinary tract including the renal pelvis, ureter, urethra and bladder*** [1] |
| **MIBC untreated** | ***> 90% 2-year mortality if untreated*** [3] |
