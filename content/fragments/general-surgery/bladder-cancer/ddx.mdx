## Differential Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer

The differential diagnosis (DDx) of bladder cancer is really the differential diagnosis of its **cardinal presenting symptom — haematuria** — plus the DDx of its secondary presentations (LUTS, pelvic pain). The clinical approach is: a patient walks in with haematuria → you must systematically consider all possible causes, determine the most likely diagnosis, and then investigate accordingly.

The guiding principle is straightforward: ***painless gross haematuria in > 35 years old = malignancy until proven otherwise*** [3][5]. But you still need to think broadly before narrowing down.

### Conceptual Framework: Anatomical Approach to Haematuria

The most logical way to build a DDx for haematuria is to walk along the urinary tract from the kidney down to the urethra, asking: "What at each level could bleed?"

Additionally, you must distinguish between:
- **Glomerular haematuria** (medical/nephrological) — dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, proteinuria, smoky brown "Coca-Cola" urine without clots
- **Non-glomerular / urological haematuria** — isomorphic (normal-shaped) RBCs, may have clots (urokinase in glomerular filtrate normally prevents clot formation, so clots suggest a post-glomerular source), bright red blood [2][5][6]

<Callout title="Why No Clots in Glomerular Bleeding?">
Urokinase is present in the glomerular filtrate and dissolves fibrin. So blood that passes through the glomerulus cannot form clots. If a patient passes blood **clots**, the bleeding source is urological (post-glomerular) — stone, tumour, infection, trauma. This is a simple but powerful bedside discriminator.

### Comprehensive DDx of Haematuria (Organised Anatomically) [5][6][7]

| Anatomical Location | Category | Differential Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features |
|:---------------------|:---------|:----------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Kidney — Glomerular** | Glomerulonephritis (GN) | IgA nephropathy, post-infectious GN, Alport syndrome, thin basement membrane disease, lupus nephritis, ANCA vasculitis (GPA, MPA), Goodpasture syndrome | Smoky brown urine without clots, dysmorphic RBCs / RBC casts on microscopy, concomitant proteinuria, features of nephritic syndrome (HTN, oedema, oliguria), systemic signs (rash, purpura, haemoptysis) [5][6] |
| **Kidney — Tubular / Parenchymal** | Polycystic kidney disease | | Bilateral flank masses, insidious HTN, family history (autosomal dominant) [5][6] |
| | Pyelonephritis | | High fever, rigors, vomiting, loin pain and tenderness [5][6] |
| | Renal infarction | | Acute loin pain, risk factors for embolism (AF, endocarditis), raised LDH [5][6] |
| | Renal vein thrombosis | | Loin pain, nephrotic syndrome, risk factors (nephrotic syndrome, malignancy) |
| | **Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)** | | Classic triad (rare): flank pain, painless haematuria, palpable flank mass; constitutional symptoms; paraneoplastic phenomena (HTN, hypercalcaemia, polycythaemia); left varicocele (left renal vein obstruction) [5][6] |
| | Renal pelvis urothelial carcinoma | | Haematuria, obstructive flank pain (20–40%), field cancerization with bladder CA [3] |
| | AV malformation | | Intermittent painless haematuria, young patient, may have bruit |
| **Ureter** | Ureteric stone | | Unilateral flank **colic** radiating to groin (classic renal colic), nausea/vomiting, restlessness [5][6] |
| | Upper tract urothelial carcinoma | | Haematuria + obstructive flank pain; field cancerization concept [1][3] |
| **Bladder** | ***CA bladder*** | | ***Painless gross haematuria throughout stream; irritative LUTS (esp CIS); constitutional symptoms if advanced*** [1][2][3] |
| | Bladder stones | | Irritative LUTS + suprapubic pain worsened by movement; interruption of urinary stream (stone intermittently blocks bladder neck) [5][6] |
| | UTI / Cystitis | | Dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort, foul-smelling/cloudy urine, fever; positive MSU culture [5][6] |
| | Non-infectious cystitis | Radiation cystitis, cyclophosphamide cystitis, ketamine cystitis | History of pelvic RT, cyclophosphamide/ifosfamide use, or ketamine abuse [5][6][7] |
| | Interstitial cystitis | | Chronic pelvic pain, frequency, urgency; diagnosis of exclusion; more common in females |
| **Prostate** | BPH | | Advanced age male, predominantly **obstructive** LUTS (hesitancy, weak stream, straining, dribbling, incomplete emptying); diagnosis by exclusion (presence of BPH should NOT dissuade from further haematuria workup) [5][6][7] |
| | CA prostate | | Obstructive LUTS, hard irregular prostate on DRE, elevated PSA, bone pain if metastatic [5][6] |
| | Prostatitis | | Perineal pain, dysuria, fever, tender prostate on DRE |
| **Urethra** | Urethral stricture | | History of urological instrumentation, STI (gonococcal urethritis), poor stream |
| | Urethral trauma | | History of catheterisation, straddle injury, pelvic fracture |
| **Systemic / Other** | Bleeding diathesis | Anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia | Seldom causes haematuria on its own — 81% have an underlying urinary cause [5][6]; bruising, bleeding gums, epistaxis |
| | Exercise-induced haematuria | | Transient, after strenuous exercise, resolves with rest; diagnosis of exclusion [5][6] |
| | Benign idiopathic haematuria | | May be associated with exercise, febrile illness, vaccination; may be familial; diagnosis of exclusion [5][6] |
| | Menstrual contamination | | Must rule out by repeating urinalysis after menses; cyclic haematuria during menses → consider urinary tract endometriosis [7] |
| | Pigmenturia (not true haematuria) | Haemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria, beetroot, rifampicin | Dipstick positive for "blood" but no RBCs on microscopy (dipstick detects haem, not RBCs specifically) |

> **High Yield:** The causes of haematuria by frequency in a urological workup: UTI (13%), ***CA bladder (12%)***, medical renal disease (10%), stone disease (4%), RCC (0.6%), CA prostate (0.4%) [3]. Bladder cancer is the **second most common cause** of haematuria in a urological setting and the **most common cause of gross haematuria in patients > 50 years old** [5].

### DDx of LUTS in the Context of Bladder Cancer [7]

Bladder cancer can present with **irritative LUTS** (especially CIS) or **obstructive LUTS** (if the tumour obstructs the bladder neck or ureteric orifice). You must differentiate from other causes:

| LUTS Pattern | DDx | Key Distinguishing Feature |
|:-------------|:----|:--------------------------|
| **Irritative (storage)** — frequency, urgency, nocturia | CA bladder (esp CIS), UTI/cystitis, bladder stones, ketamine cystitis, interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder (neurogenic or idiopathic), radiation cystitis | CIS: elderly + risk factors + refractory to antibiotics; UTI: dysuria + positive culture; Bladder stone: pain with movement; OAB: diagnosis of exclusion [7] |
| **Obstructive (voiding)** — hesitancy, weak stream, straining, dribbling | BPH, CA prostate, urethral stricture, bladder neck contracture, CA bladder (large tumour at bladder neck) | BPH: symmetrically enlarged smooth prostate on DRE; CA prostate: hard irregular prostate + elevated PSA; Stricture: history of instrumentation/STI [7] |

<Callout title="Important Exam Point" type="error">
**New-onset irritative LUTS in an elderly patient that does NOT respond to antibiotics** → must consider CIS of the bladder. Do NOT keep prescribing antibiotics for "recurrent UTIs" without a cystoscopy in an at-risk patient (male, > 40, smoker). CIS is flat, high-grade, and easily missed on standard imaging — it requires cystoscopy (± fluorescence/NBI) for detection [1][3].
</Callout>

### DDx of Bladder Mass (Found on Imaging or Cystoscopy)

If a mass is identified in the bladder (e.g., on CT urogram or cystoscopy), the DDx includes:

| Category | Diagnosis | Distinguishing Features |
|:---------|:----------|:-----------------------|
| **Primary malignant** | Urothelial carcinoma (90%) | Most common; papillary or sessile; field cancerization |
| | Squamous cell carcinoma | History of chronic irritation / schistosomiasis; keratinising on biopsy |
| | Adenocarcinoma | Urachal remnant (dome location); must exclude secondary (colorectal, prostate) |
| | ***Small cell carcinoma*** | ***Rare but very aggressive*** [4]; neuroendocrine markers on IHC |
| | ***Sarcomatoid carcinoma*** | ***Aggressive, poor prognosis*** [4]; biphasic on histology |
| | Non-epithelial (sarcoma, lymphoma, melanoma, paraganglioma) | Very rare; specific histological/IHC features [3] |
| **Secondary malignant** | Direct invasion from colon, rectum, prostate, uterine cervix [3] | History of known primary malignancy; imaging shows contiguous invasion |
| | Metastatic (melanoma, stomach, breast) | Very rare; history of distant primary |
| **Benign** | Urothelial papilloma / inverted papilloma | Small, typically solitary, regular papillary architecture; benign histology |
| | Nephrogenic adenoma | History of prior bladder surgery/trauma/infection; benign but mimics carcinoma |
| | Cystitis cystica / cystitis glandularis | Chronic inflammatory change; benign but can mimic tumour |
| | Endometriosis | Female, cyclic symptoms, submucosal bluish nodule on cystoscopy |
| | Blood clot | History of recent haematuria; mobile, no vascular pattern; resolves |
| | Foreign body | History of self-insertion or iatrogenic (retained catheter fragment, surgical material) |

### Key Discriminating Features in History

| **Age** | > 40 years, elderly | Young (< 40 → think GN, stone, UTI) |
| **Sex** | Male (M:F = 3:1) | — |
| **Haematuria character** | Painless, gross, throughout stream, intermittent | Painful → stone, UTI; initial → urethra; terminal → prostate/bladder neck; smoky brown without clots → GN |
| **Blood clots** | Present (urological source) | Absent with dysmorphic RBCs → GN |
| **LUTS** | Irritative (esp. refractory to Abx → CIS) | Obstructive only → BPH/CA prostate |
| **Smoking / occupational exposure** | Strong risk factor | — |
| **Cyclophosphamide / aristolochic acid** | Strong risk factor | — |
| **Recent URTI** | Less likely bladder CA | IgA nephropathy (synpharyngitic haematuria) |
| **Systemic features** | Constitutional Sx → advanced CA | Rash/arthralgia → SLE/vasculitis; haemoptysis → pulmonary-renal syndrome |
| **Response to antibiotics** | No response (CIS mimics UTI) | Resolves → likely UTI |

### Red Flags Mandating Urgent Urological Referral [5][6]

Any of the following in a patient with haematuria should prompt **urgent cystoscopy and upper tract imaging**:

- ***Age > 40 with any unexplained haematuria (gross or microscopic)***
- ***Painless gross haematuria at any age***
- ***Visible haematuria with risk factors for malignancy*** (smoking, occupational exposure, cyclophosphamide, aristolochic acid, pelvic RT, chronic catheter) [5]
- Persistent microscopic haematuria (≥ 3 RBC/HPF on ≥ 2 out of 3 properly collected samples) after exclusion of benign causes
- Recurrent UTIs in a male or post-menopausal female (must exclude underlying malignancy)
- New-onset irritative LUTS refractory to treatment in an at-risk patient

<Callout title="Common Exam Mistake" type="error">
**Presence of BPH should NOT dissuade from further evaluation of haematuria** — older men with BPH are also at risk for bladder cancer, RCC, and other urological malignancies. Always investigate haematuria fully even if BPH is present [7].
</Callout>

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**The DDx of bladder cancer is essentially the DDx of haematuria**, organized anatomically from kidney to urethra plus systemic causes.

**Most common cause of haematuria overall**: UTI (13%). **Most worrying**: malignancy (CA bladder 12%, RCC 0.6%) [2][3].

**Most common cause of gross haematuria in patients > 50**: bladder cancer [5].

**Key discriminators**:
- Glomerular vs urological: dysmorphic RBCs/casts/proteinuria = glomerular; isomorphic RBCs ± clots = urological
- Painless = malignancy until proven otherwise; painful = stone, UTI, infarction
- Throughout stream = bladder/upper tract; initial = urethra; terminal = bladder neck/prostate
- Blood clots = urological (urokinase in glomerular filtrate prevents clots in GN)
- Irritative LUTS refractory to antibiotics in elderly = CIS until proven otherwise

**DDx of bladder mass**: Primary malignant (urothelial 90%, SCC, adeno, small cell, sarcomatoid), secondary malignant (colon, rectum, prostate, cervix), benign (papilloma, nephrogenic adenoma, cystitis cystica, endometriosis, blood clot)

**BPH does NOT exclude malignancy** — always investigate haematuria fully even if BPH is present.
