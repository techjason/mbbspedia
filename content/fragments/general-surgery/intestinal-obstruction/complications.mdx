## Complications of Intestinal Obstruction

Complications of IO are the reason this condition carries significant mortality. Understanding them requires tracing the pathophysiology we've already established to its logical endpoints. Every complication is a consequence of either (a) the obstruction itself and its downstream effects, or (b) the treatment of the obstruction.

> ***High mortality if complications occur*** [1]

We can categorise complications into:
1. **Local complications** (arising from the bowel itself)
2. **Systemic complications** (arising from the body's response to the obstruction)
3. **Post-operative / treatment-related complications**
4. **Disease-specific complications** (unique to certain causes of IO)

---

### A. Local Complications

#### 1. Strangulation (Bowel Ischaemia → Necrosis)

This is the most feared and time-critical complication of IO. The lecture slides emphasise [1]:

> ***Compromise of blood supply, leading to necrosis and perforation of bowel (accelerated in close-loop or strangulating obstruction)*** [1]

**Pathogenesis** [3]:
- ***Blood supply is compromised when bowel dilatation is excessive*** [3]
- ***Bowel becomes ischaemic and leads to necrosis or perforation*** [3]

**Causes of strangulation** [3]:
- ***↑ Intraluminal pressure*** — progressive accumulation of gas and fluid raises the pressure inside the bowel lumen → compresses first the thin-walled veins (lower pressure) → venous congestion → further oedema → eventually compresses arteries → ischaemia
- ***Direct pressure on bowel wall*** — constricting band (adhesion), hernia ring, or twist (volvulus) compresses the bowel externally
- ***Interrupted mesenteric blood flow*** — volvulus twists the mesenteric pedicle directly occluding the SMA/SMV branches; hernia ring compresses mesenteric vessels within the hernial neck

**Why is this accelerated in closed-loop obstruction?** Because in a closed-loop, gas and fluid cannot escape in either direction → intraluminal pressure rises much faster than in a simple, single-point obstruction → ischaemia develops within hours, not days.

**Features suggestive of strangulation** [3]:

| Category | Features |
|:---------|:---------|
| ***Clinical (Signs)*** | ***Fever, tachycardia, peritoneal signs*** (guarding, rigidity, rebound tenderness) [3] |
| ***Clinical (Symptoms)*** | ***Continuous or worsening abdominal pain*** [3] — the transition from colicky to constant pain is a critical red flag. Colicky pain means the bowel is still alive and contracting; constant pain means the bowel is dying and continuously irritating the peritoneum. |
| ***Biochemical*** | ***Leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis*** [3] — WCC rises from systemic inflammatory response; lactate rises from anaerobic metabolism in ischaemic tissue; metabolic acidosis results from both. |
| ***Radiological*** | ***Pneumoperitoneum, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas*** [3] |

**Prognosis** [1][3]:
- ***Non-strangulating obstruction: mortality 2%*** [1]
- ***Strangulating obstruction: mortality 10–30%*** [1]
- ***Morbidity and mortality are dependent on duration of ischaemia and its extent*** [3]
- ***Any length of ischaemic bowel can cause significant systemic effects secondary to sepsis and dehydration*** [3]

<Callout title="The Strangulation Mortality Gap" type="error">
The mortality jump from ***2% (simple) to 10–30% (strangulated)*** [1] tells you everything about why early recognition and intervention matter. The clinical clue is the **transition from colicky to constant pain** — this should trigger immediate escalation. Do not wait for peritonism, fever, and raised lactate to all appear; any ONE of these in the right context mandates urgent surgical exploration.
</Callout>

#### 2. Perforation

Perforation is the endpoint of untreated ischaemia — the necrotic bowel wall loses its structural integrity and breaks down.

**Pathophysiology**:
- Transmural necrosis → loss of all wall layers → luminal contents (bacteria, faecal matter) spill into the peritoneal cavity
- In **LBO with a competent ileocaecal valve**: the **caecum** is the most likely site of perforation because it has the largest diameter (Laplace's law: Wall Tension = Pressure × Radius) → caecal diameter > 9–12 cm on imaging is critical [4]
- In **closed-loop obstruction**: perforation can occur at the site of maximal distension within the closed loop itself

**Consequences of perforation**:
- **Faecal peritonitis**: massive bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity → overwhelming sepsis → multi-organ failure
- **Free gas (pneumoperitoneum)**: visible on erect CXR or CT
- Mortality of faecal peritonitis is very high (up to 30–50%)

**Clinical features**: Sudden worsening of pain (may paradoxically improve briefly as distension is released), followed by board-like rigidity, absent bowel sounds, haemodynamic collapse

#### 3. Closed-Loop Obstruction

While this is primarily a *type* of obstruction, it is also considered a complication because any obstruction can *evolve* into a closed-loop situation:

- ***Obstruction inside closed loop → impaired blood flow → risk of necrosis and perforation*** [4]
- Examples: malignant stricture of colon + competent ileocaecal valve, volvulus, hernia, afferent loop syndrome [4]
- **Why is this a complication?** A patient with a left-sided colonic tumour may initially have a partially competent ileocaecal valve that becomes fully competent as colonic distension increases → converting a simple LBO into a dangerous closed-loop obstruction

#### 4. Bacterial Translocation

**Pathophysiology**:
- Normal intact bowel mucosa acts as a barrier preventing intraluminal bacteria from entering the bloodstream
- In IO: mucosal ischaemia → loss of mucosal barrier integrity → bacteria and endotoxins cross the bowel wall into the mesenteric lymph nodes, portal venous system, and peritoneal cavity
- ***Bacterial overgrowth*** [1] in the stagnant, dilated bowel amplifies this process — the longer the obstruction persists, the greater the bacterial load
- This is the mechanism by which uncomplicated IO can progress to **sepsis** and **multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS)** even *before* frank perforation occurs

---

### B. Systemic Complications

#### 1. Dehydration and Electrolyte Disturbance

> ***Complications: Systemic — dehydration, electrolyte disturbance*** [4]

This is arguably the most common complication and is present to some degree in almost every patient with IO.

**Pathophysiology** (already covered in detail, summarised here):

| Mechanism | Effect |
|:----------|:-------|
| Vomiting | Loss of H₂O, Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, H⁺ → **hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis** |
| Third-spacing | Fluid sequestered in bowel lumen and peritoneal cavity → effectively lost from circulation |
| Reduced oral intake | NPO + nausea → no fluid input |
| Defective intestinal absorption | Oedematous bowel wall cannot absorb water/electrolytes [4] |
| Transudation | ***Hypersecretion and loss of fluid to extracellular space and peritoneal cavity*** [1] |

**Consequences**:
- **Hypovolaemic shock**: tachycardia → hypotension → oliguria → pre-renal AKI → multi-organ failure if uncorrected
- **Hypokalaemia**: can cause cardiac arrhythmias (U waves, flat T waves, prolonged QT), muscle weakness, and paradoxically worsens ileus (K⁺ is essential for smooth muscle repolarisation — a vicious cycle)
- **Metabolic alkalosis** (from vomiting) or **metabolic acidosis** (from ischaemia/dehydration) → mixed acid-base disorders are common
- **Pre-renal AKI**: reduced renal perfusion from hypovolaemia → elevated urea and creatinine

#### 2. Aspiration Pneumonia

> ***Complications: Systemic — aspiration pneumonia*** [4]

**Pathophysiology**:
- In IO, the stomach and proximal bowel are filled with regurgitated, stagnant, bacteria-laden fluid
- If the patient vomits (especially while supine or during anaesthetic induction), this fluid can be aspirated into the tracheobronchial tree
- Aspiration of acidic gastric contents → chemical pneumonitis (Mendelson's syndrome)
- Aspiration of bacteria-laden intestinal contents → aspiration pneumonia
- **Why NG decompression is protective**: draining the stomach reduces the volume of gastric/intestinal fluid available for aspiration

**Clinical features**: Cough, dyspnoea, fever, tachypnoea, crackles on auscultation, new infiltrate on CXR (typically right lower lobe — more vertical right main bronchus)

**Prevention**: NG decompression, semi-recumbent positioning (30° head-up), rapid sequence induction (RSI) with cricoid pressure during anaesthetic induction

#### 3. Sepsis and Multi-Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS)

**Pathophysiology cascade**:
1. Bacterial translocation from ischaemic bowel → bacteraemia
2. Systemic inflammatory response (SIRS): fever/hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnoea, leucocytosis/leucopenia
3. Sepsis → septic shock → MODS (renal failure, respiratory failure, hepatic dysfunction, DIC, cardiovascular collapse)

This is the mechanism underlying the high mortality of strangulated obstruction.

#### 4. Venous Thromboembolism (DVT/PE)

**Pathophysiology**:
- IO patients have Virchow's triad in full force:
  - **Stasis**: immobilisation (bed rest), reduced venous return from hypovolaemia
  - **Endothelial injury**: surgical trauma (if operated)
  - **Hypercoagulability**: dehydration → haemoconcentration; systemic inflammation; underlying malignancy
- **Prevention**: LMWH prophylaxis (e.g. enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily), TED stockings, early mobilisation

---

### C. Post-Operative / Treatment-Related Complications

These complications arise from the surgical treatment of IO rather than from the obstruction itself.

#### 1. Anastomotic Leak

**Pathophysiology**:
- After bowel resection and anastomosis, the two joined bowel ends must heal together
- **Risk factors for leak**: poor blood supply to bowel ends, tension on the anastomosis, malnutrition, steroid use, contaminated field, unprepared bowel (faecal loading), emergency surgery (vs. elective)
- **Why is leak dangerous?** Intestinal contents spill into the peritoneal cavity → peritonitis → sepsis → MODS
- ***Left-sided colonic obstruction*** carries higher leak risk because the ***heavy bacterial and faecal load in proximal colon*** and ***oedematous unhealthy proximal colon*** [1] make primary anastomosis risky
  - This is precisely why ***Hartmann's procedure*** (resection without anastomosis) is the safer default in emergency left-sided colonic surgery [4]
  - And why ***primary anastomosis is risky*** [1] in this context

**Clinical features**: Typically presents days 3–7 post-op with fever, tachycardia, abdominal pain, peritonism, rising inflammatory markers, foul/faeculent drain output

**Management**: Return to theatre for washout ± re-anastomosis or stoma formation; IV antibiotics; ICU support

#### 2. Recurrent Adhesive Obstruction

**Pathophysiology**:
- Surgery for adhesive SBO (adhesiolysis) itself causes peritoneal trauma → new adhesion formation → recurrent SBO
- This creates a frustrating cycle: each operation to treat adhesions can cause more adhesions
- **Risk**: ~30% of patients who undergo adhesiolysis will develop recurrent SBO
- **Prevention**: Minimise peritoneal trauma during surgery (meticulous haemostasis, gentle tissue handling, minimal serosal drying); consider adhesion barriers (e.g. Seprafilm); laparoscopic approach where possible (less peritoneal trauma than open surgery)

#### 3. Wound Infection (Surgical Site Infection)

**Pathophysiology**:
- IO surgery is often performed in contaminated or dirty fields (bacterial overgrowth in stagnant bowel, possible perforation)
- Faecal contamination during surgery → wound contamination → SSI
- **Prevention**: Prophylactic IV antibiotics, meticulous surgical technique, wound lavage

#### 4. Paralytic Ileus (Post-operative)

- ***A degree of paralytic ileus is common after any abdominal procedure with a variable duration of 24–72 hours*** [3]
- Prolonged ileus ( > 72 hours) is a complication in itself and can occur after any IO surgery
- **Causes of prolonged post-op ileus**: intra-abdominal sepsis, electrolyte disturbance (particularly hypokalaemia), opiate analgesics, excessive bowel handling during surgery
- **Management**: Correct underlying cause, drip and suck, prokinetics, early mobilisation, minimise opioids

#### 5. Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)

**Pathophysiology**:
- If extensive bowel resection is required (e.g. massive midgut necrosis from volvulus, mesenteric ischaemia, or multiple resections for recurrent adhesive SBO), the remaining bowel length may be insufficient for adequate nutrient and fluid absorption
- Defined as < 200 cm of remaining small bowel (or < 100 cm without colon in continuity)
- ***High risk of short gut syndrome: diarrhoea, steatorrhoea → dehydration, malabsorption, weight loss*** [4]

**Clinical consequences**:
- Malabsorption → malnutrition, weight loss, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, K)
- Chronic diarrhoea and steatorrhoea
- Dependence on TPN (parenteral nutrition)
- Complications of TPN: central line infections, hepatic steatosis, cholestasis, metabolic bone disease

#### 6. Stoma-Related Complications

If a stoma is created (e.g. Hartmann's procedure, defunctioning ileostomy):
- **High output stoma**: particularly ileostomy → significant fluid and electrolyte losses (Na⁺, K⁺, Mg²⁺, HCO₃⁻) → dehydration, renal impairment
- **Parastomal hernia**: weakening of abdominal wall around the stoma site
- **Stoma prolapse**: intussusception of bowel through the stoma
- **Stoma retraction**: stoma sinks below skin level → poor appliance fit → skin excoriation
- **Skin excoriation**: contact dermatitis from intestinal effluent (especially alkaline ileal output)
- **Psychological impact**: body image concerns, social isolation

### D. Disease-Specific Complications

#### 1. Obstructing Colorectal Cancer [1]

> ***Obstructing colorectal cancer: more advanced cancer, elderly patients with comorbidity, high operative mortality and morbidity, worse prognosis*** [1]

- ***Prognosis of emergency surgery for colonic obstruction: mortality more than 10%*** [1]
  - ***Comorbidity*** [1] and ***advanced malignancy*** [1] are the key drivers of this high mortality
- Patients presenting with CRC as an emergency obstruction tend to have more advanced-stage disease (larger tumours, higher T stage, more nodal involvement) compared to those diagnosed electively
- Emergency surgery carries higher leak rates, higher infection rates, and higher stoma rates compared to elective surgery
- **Left-sided obstruction** is particularly challenging [1]:
  - ***Competence of ileocaecal valve (closed-loop obstruction → perforation)*** [1]
  - ***Heavy bacterial and faecal load in proximal colon*** [1]
  - ***Oedematous, unhealthy proximal colon*** [1]
  - ***Poor general condition of patient: malignancy and malnutrition, dehydration*** [1]
  - ***Primary anastomosis is risky*** [1]

#### 2. Hirschsprung-Associated Enterocolitis (HAEC) [3]

- The ***most severe and lethal complication*** of Hirschsprung's disease [3]
- Can occur before surgery, in the immediate post-operative period, or years after definitive repair
- **Pathogenesis**: Stasis in aganglionic segment → reduced protective mucin production → bacterial overgrowth → bacterial translocation through the compromised mucosa → bowel wall invasion by colonic organisms → can lead to perforation, peritonitis, septic shock, and death [3]
- ***Incidence as high as 45%*** [3]
- **Clinical features**: Explosive, foul-smelling diarrhoea, abdominal distension, fever, sepsis
- **Management**: IV fluid resuscitation, IV antibiotics, repeated rectal irrigations (saline) through rectal tube, diverting ileostomy/colostomy if refractory [3]

#### 3. Intussusception — Complications of Reduction [3]

- ***Perforation ( < 1%)*** [3] — risk factors include ***age < 6 months, long duration of symptoms, and higher pressure during reduction*** [3]
- **Recurrence**: approximately 5–10% after successful non-operative reduction; higher in children with pathological lead points
- **Post-reduction fever**: ***Patient usually presents with fever after successful reduction due to bacterial translocation or release of endotoxin or cytokines*** [3]

#### 4. Malrotation with Midgut Volvulus — Complications of Ladd's Procedure [3]

- ***Small bowel obstruction from adhesions*** [3]
- ***Short bowel syndrome (if resection is necessary when necrotic bowel is present)*** [3]
- Recurrent volvulus (rare but possible if mesenteric base not adequately broadened)

#### 5. Intestinal Atresia — Post-Operative Complications [3]

- ***Poor feeding and vomiting*** [3]
- ***Volume depletion*** [3]
- ***Electrolyte imbalance*** [3]
- ***Aspiration pneumonia*** [3]
- Anastomotic stricture
- Short bowel syndrome (especially in Type IIIb apple-peel atresia with limited bowel length)

### E. Complications Summary Table

| Category | Complication | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---------|:------------|:------------------------|
| **Local** | ***Strangulation / Ischaemia*** | ↑ Intraluminal pressure / direct compression / mesenteric vessel occlusion → venous congestion → arterial compromise → ischaemia |
| | ***Perforation*** | Transmural necrosis → loss of wall integrity → spillage of luminal contents |
| | ***Closed-loop obstruction*** | Obstruction at 2 points → rapid pressure rise → accelerated ischaemia and perforation |
| | **Bacterial translocation** | Mucosal barrier breakdown from ischaemia → bacteria cross bowel wall → bacteraemia, peritonitis |
| **Systemic** | ***Dehydration and electrolyte disturbance*** | Vomiting, third-spacing, reduced intake, defective absorption |
| | ***Aspiration pneumonia*** | Regurgitation of stagnant bowel contents → aspiration into lungs |
| | **Sepsis / MODS** | Bacterial translocation → SIRS → septic shock → organ failure |
| | **VTE (DVT/PE)** | Virchow's triad: stasis, dehydration/hypercoagulability, endothelial injury |
| **Post-operative** | **Anastomotic leak** | Poor healing at bowel join → faecal peritonitis |
| | **Recurrent adhesive SBO** | Surgery causes new adhesions → recurrent obstruction (~30%) |
| | **Wound infection** | Contaminated/dirty surgical field |
| | ***Post-operative ileus*** | Peritoneal inflammation, electrolyte disturbance, opioids |
| | ***Short bowel syndrome*** | Extensive resection → insufficient absorptive surface |
| | **Stoma complications** | High output, parastomal hernia, prolapse, retraction, skin excoriation |

---

### F. Prognosis

The prognosis of IO depends entirely on whether complications develop:

| Scenario | Mortality |
|:---------|:---------|
| ***Non-strangulating obstruction*** | ***2%*** [1] |
| ***Strangulating obstruction*** | ***10–30%*** [1] |
| ***Emergency surgery for colonic obstruction*** | ***More than 10%*** [1] |
| Faecal peritonitis from perforation | 30–50% |
| Neonatal midgut volvulus with extensive necrosis | Very high; survivors may have lifelong SBS |

**Key prognostic factors** [1]:
- Duration of obstruction before treatment (longer = more ischaemia = worse outcome)
- Presence of strangulation
- Patient comorbidity (especially in elderly with obstructing CRC)
- Stage of malignancy (if cancer is the cause)
- Timeliness of surgical intervention

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of IO">

1. **Strangulation** is the most feared complication: ***mortality jumps from 2% (simple) to 10–30% (strangulated)***. Accelerated in closed-loop obstruction and volvulus.

2. **Signs of strangulation**: constant pain (not colicky), fever, tachycardia, peritonism, leucocytosis, metabolic acidosis/raised lactate, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas.

3. **Perforation**: end-stage of ischaemia → faecal peritonitis → sepsis → death. Caecum is most vulnerable site in LBO (Laplace's law: largest radius = greatest wall tension).

4. **Systemic**: Dehydration (hypoK, metabolic alkalosis from vomiting; metabolic acidosis from ischaemia), aspiration pneumonia (prevented by NG decompression), sepsis/MODS (from bacterial translocation), VTE.

5. **Post-operative**: Anastomotic leak (especially left-sided colonic surgery — why Hartmann's is preferred), recurrent adhesive SBO (~30%), wound infection, post-op ileus, short bowel syndrome, stoma complications.

6. **Disease-specific**: HAEC in Hirschsprung's (up to 45%); perforation in intussusception reduction ( < 1%); adhesive SBO after Ladd's procedure.

7. **Emergency surgery for colonic obstruction mortality > 10%** — driven by comorbidity and advanced malignancy.
