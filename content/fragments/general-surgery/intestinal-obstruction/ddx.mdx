## Differential Diagnosis of Intestinal Obstruction

The differential diagnosis of intestinal obstruction is essentially the process of determining **why** the bowel is obstructed — and, crucially, **whether it is truly obstructed at all**. Many conditions mimic the cardinal features of IO (pain, distension, vomiting, constipation) without an actual mechanical barrier, and some mechanical causes masquerade as others. The approach must be systematic.

### A. The Core Clinical Question: Is This Really Intestinal Obstruction?

Before diving into specific causes, the clinician must answer three sequential questions:

1. **Is there truly an obstruction?** (vs. a mimic like paralytic ileus, gastroenteritis, or a medical cause of acute abdomen)
2. **If yes, is it mechanical or functional?**
3. **If mechanical, what is the specific cause and is there strangulation?**

***Severity of each symptom depends on the level of obstruction*** [1] — this principle is central to the differential because a high SBO presents very differently from an LBO.

<Callout title="Key Lecture Point" type="idea">
***Bilious vomiting is always pathological*** in neonates [2]. ***Abdominal distension is not always present*** [2]. ***Meconium or stool does not exclude obstruction*** [2]. These three points mean that clinical suspicion must remain high even when the "classic" tetrad is incomplete — especially in neonates.

### B. Systematic Framework for the Differential Diagnosis

The differential is best organised by:
1. **Level**: SBO vs. LBO
2. **Mechanism**: Mechanical vs. Functional
3. **Age group**: Adult vs. Neonatal/Paediatric
4. **Mimics**: Conditions that present like IO but are not

### C. Differential Diagnosis of Small Bowel Obstruction (Adults)

> ***Most common causes of SBO: Adhesions, Bulge (hernia), Cancer — mnemonic "ABC"*** [3][4]

#### (i) Mechanical Causes

| Category | Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why it causes SBO |
|:---------|:------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------|
| **Extramural** | ***Adhesions*** (~60–74%) [1][3] | History of prior abdominal/pelvic surgery; recurrent episodes; may resolve with conservative Mx | Fibrous bands kink, compress, or angulate bowel loops → luminal obstruction |
| | ***Incarcerated hernia*** (~10%) [4] | Tender, irreducible groin/umbilical/incisional lump; ***check hernial orifices*** [7] | Bowel loop trapped within hernial sac → lumen obstructed ± vascular compromise |
| | ***Volvulus*** | Acute onset, may have signs of ischaemia | Twisting of mesentery obstructs lumen AND blood supply simultaneously |
| | ***Intraperitoneal malignancy*** | Peritoneal carcinomatosis (ovarian, gastric, CRC); ascites, weight loss, cachexia | Extrinsic compression of bowel loops by tumour deposits or malignant adhesions |
| **Intramural** | ***Tumour*** (lymphoma, GIST, adenoCA) ~5% [1] | Subacute onset, weight loss, anaemia, may have palpable mass | Intramural growth narrows the lumen from within the wall |
| | ***Strictures*** (Crohn's, radiation, anastomotic, drug-induced) [1] | History of Crohn's disease (~7% of SBO [1]), prior RT, NSAID use, or previous anastomosis | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → fixed narrowing of lumen |
| | ***Intussusception*** | Adults: suspect a pathological lead point (polyp, tumour, Meckel's) | Proximal segment telescopes into distal → luminal obstruction + venous congestion |
| **Intraluminal** | ***Gallstone ileus*** | Elderly female, ***Rigler's triad (pneumobilia + SBO + ectopic gallstone)*** [4]; ***Bouveret's syndrome*** if GOO [4] | Large stone erodes via ***cholecystoenteric fistula*** → impacts at terminal ileum (narrowest SB segment, ***2 feet proximal to IC valve***) [4] |
| | ***Bezoar*** (trichobezoar / phytobezoar) | Psychiatric history (trichotillomania), prior gastric surgery, gastroparesis | Accumulated indigestible material physically blocks lumen |
| | ***Foreign body*** | History of ingestion (children, psychiatric patients, prisoners) | Physical blockage |
| | ***Worms (Ascaris)*** | Endemic area, multiple worms form a bolus | Physical blockage by worm mass |
| | ***Faecal impaction*** | Elderly, immobile, opioid use, chronic constipation | Inspissated stool acts as intraluminal plug |

#### (ii) Functional Causes (Mimicking or Co-existing with SBO)

| Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why it mimics IO |
|:------------|:---------------------------|:----------------|
| ***Paralytic ileus / Post-operative ileus*** [4] | History of recent surgery (***clinically significant if > 72h post-op*** [4]), peritonitis, or metabolic derangement; ***hypoactive bowel sounds*** [4]; no transition point on imaging | No peristalsis → gas and fluid accumulate → distension and vomiting, but no mechanical barrier |
| ***Ogilvie's syndrome*** [3][4] | Hospitalised patient with severe comorbidity; ***normal bowel sounds***; ***dilated rectum on PR*** [4]; gas in rectum on AXR | Autonomic imbalance → colonic aperistalsis without mechanical cause |
| ***Drug-induced ileus*** | Opioids, anticholinergics, CCBs in drug history | Pharmacological suppression of myenteric plexus activity |
| ***Metabolic ileus*** | HypoK, hypothyroidism, uraemia, DKA | Electrolyte/hormonal derangement impairs smooth muscle contractility |

---

### D. Differential Diagnosis of Large Bowel Obstruction (Adults)

> ***Common causes of LBO: Cancer of colon, Volvulus, Diverticular stricture, Pseudo-obstruction*** [7]

| Category | Differential | Key Distinguishing Features | Why it causes LBO |
|:---------|:------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------|
| **Neoplastic** | ***Colorectal cancer*** | ***More advanced cancer, elderly patients with comorbidity, high operative mortality and morbidity, worse prognosis*** [1]; change in bowel habit, weight loss, anaemia, PR bleeding, palpable mass | Progressive intraluminal growth narrows the colonic lumen; ***15–20% of CRC patients present with IO*** [1] |
| **Volvulus** | ***Sigmoid volvulus*** (70%) | Older males, chronic constipation, institutionalised; ***coffee bean sign on AXR*** [4]; ***bird's beak sign on contrast enema*** [4] | Twisting of sigmoid around narrow mesosigmoid → closed-loop obstruction |
| | ***Caecal volvulus*** (25%) | Younger females, congenital hypermobile caecum; dilated SB on AXR | Failed fusion of ascending colon mesentery → mobile caecum twists |
| **Inflammatory** | ***Diverticular stricture*** | History of recurrent diverticulitis; LLQ (Western) or RLQ (Asia) pain; fibrotic narrowing | Chronic inflammation → fibrosis → fixed stricture of colonic lumen |
| **Stricture** | ***Anastomotic / Radiation / Ischaemic / Endometriotic*** [1] | Prior surgery, RT, vascular disease, or endometriosis history | Fibrotic narrowing from healing/scarring process |
| **Extrinsic** | ***Metastasis / Pelvic tumour*** [1] | Known primary (ovarian, uterine, prostatic); pelvic mass on examination | External compression of colon by adjacent tumour mass |
| **Pseudo-obstruction** | ***Ogilvie's syndrome*** | As above; ***diagnosis of exclusion*** [4] | Functional, not mechanical |
| **Toxic megacolon** | | IBD history, ***C. difficile*** infection, antibiotic use; ***bloody diarrhoea***; systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, leucocytosis) [3] | Total or segmental colonic dilatation with systemic toxicity → mimics obstructive LBO but mechanism is inflammatory paralysis |

<Callout title="Sigmoid Volvulus vs. Toxic Megacolon vs. Ogilvie's" type="error">
These three conditions all present with massive colonic dilatation and can look similar on AXR. Differentiation is crucial because management is completely different:
- **Sigmoid volvulus**: ***coffee bean sign***, absent rectal gas, no systemic toxicity initially → endoscopic decompression
- **Toxic megacolon**: systemic toxicity, ***bloody diarrhoea***, IBD/***C. difficile*** history → medical management ± colectomy
- **Ogilvie's**: hospitalised patient, no systemic toxicity, ***normal bowel sounds, dilated rectum, gas in rectum on AXR*** → supportive ± neostigmine ± colonoscopic decompression
</Callout>

### E. Differential Diagnosis of Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction

***Causes of neonatal intestinal obstruction*** [2]:
- ***Intestinal atresia (oesophagus to anus)***
- ***Malrotation***
- ***Meconium disease***
- ***Hirschsprung's disease***

The key differentiating feature in neonates is the **character of vomiting** (bilious vs. non-bilious) and the **timing/passage of meconium**.

| Differential | Age at Presentation | Vomiting | Distension | Meconium | Key Diagnostic Clue |
|:------------|:-------------------|:---------|:-----------|:---------|:-------------------|
| ***Malrotation with midgut volvulus*** | Days 1–28 (often first week) | ***Bilious (always pathological)*** [2] | May be minimal | May have passed normally | ***Upper GI contrast study showing DJ junction malposition***; surgical emergency |
| ***Duodenal atresia*** | Day 1 | Bilious (if distal to ampulla) or non-bilious (if proximal) | Epigastric only (proximal obstruction) | May pass normally | ***"Double bubble" sign on AXR***; association with ***Down syndrome*** [3] |
| ***Jejunoileal atresia*** | Day 1–2 | Bilious | Progressive | Absent or scant | ***Multiple dilated loops with air-fluid levels***; no gas in rectum |
| ***Meconium ileus*** | Day 1–2 | Bilious | Marked | Absent (inspissated) | Ground-glass appearance on AXR (Neuhauser sign); association with ***cystic fibrosis*** [3] |
| ***Hirschsprung's disease*** | Day 1–3 (or later in short-segment) | Bilious (late) | Progressive, massive | Delayed > 48h (***failure to pass meconium in 90%***) [3] | ***"Blast sign" on PR***; contrast enema showing transition zone; rectal suction biopsy (gold standard) |
| ***Anorectal malformation*** | Day 1 | Late | Progressive | Absent; no visible anus | Absent/abnormal anus on perineal inspection |
| ***Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)*** | Premature neonates, days 2–14 | Bilious | Marked, tender | Bloody stools | Pneumatosis intestinalis on AXR; portal venous gas |
| ***Incarcerated inguinal hernia*** | Any neonatal age | May or may not be present | Variable | Variable | Palpable, irreducible groin swelling; especially in premature males |
| ***Pyloric stenosis*** | 2–8 weeks | ***Non-bilious, projectile*** | Epigastric only | Normal | Palpable "olive" mass in epigastrium; hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis; pyloric muscle thickening on USS |

<Callout title="Bilious Vomiting in a Neonate" type="error">
***Bilious vomiting in a neonate = malrotation with midgut volvulus until proven otherwise***. This is a **surgical emergency** because the entire midgut can infarct within hours if the volvulus is not reduced. Do NOT wait for further investigations if the clinical picture is suspicious — obtain an urgent upper GI contrast study and call the paediatric surgeon immediately.
</Callout>

### F. Differential Diagnosis by Presenting Feature

Sometimes patients present with a dominant symptom rather than the full tetrad. Here is a feature-based differential approach:

#### (i) Abdominal Pain + Distension + Vomiting — "Is it really IO?"

| Mimic | Why it mimics IO | How to differentiate |
|:------|:----------------|:--------------------|
| **Acute pancreatitis** | Severe epigastric pain, vomiting, ileus (reflex ileus from retroperitoneal inflammation) | Elevated amylase/lipase; CT findings; pain radiating to back; no transition point on AXR |
| **Acute mesenteric ischaemia** | Severe abdominal pain "out of proportion to examination," vomiting, distension | AF or embolic source; raised lactate; CT angiography showing SMA occlusion; pain early, signs late |
| **Acute peritonitis** (e.g., perforated peptic ulcer) | Board-like rigidity, absent bowel sounds, vomiting | ***Free gas on erect CXR***; history of PUD/NSAID use; peritonism from the outset (not progressive as in strangulated IO) |
| **Gastroenteritis** | Vomiting, diarrhoea, colicky abdominal pain, may have distension | Diarrhoea is prominent (not constipation); infective contacts; self-limiting; AXR non-specific |
| **Diabetic ketoacidosis** | Severe abdominal pain ("pseudoperitonitis"), vomiting, dehydration | Hyperglycaemia, ketonuria, metabolic acidosis; no mechanical obstruction on imaging |
| **Acute urinary retention** | Suprapubic distension, pain, inability to void | Palpable bladder, confirmed by USS/catheterisation; no features of bowel obstruction on AXR |
| **Ruptured AAA** | Acute abdominal/back pain, hypotension, distension | Pulsatile abdominal mass; CT angiography; haemodynamic instability disproportionate to IO features |

#### (ii) Acute Abdomen by Location — Cross-referencing IO Mimics [4]

| Location | IO-related DDx | Non-IO Mimics |
|:---------|:--------------|:-------------|
| **RLQ** | Caecal volvulus, appendiceal mass causing SBO, Crohn's stricture | ***Acute appendicitis***, ***right-sided diverticulitis*** (Asia), ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, ureteric colic [3][4] |
| **LLQ** | Sigmoid volvulus, diverticular stricture, CRC | ***Acute diverticulitis***, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, ureteric colic |
| **Central/diffuse** | Adhesive SBO, generalised peritonitis from perforated strangulated bowel | ***Perforated viscus, ruptured AAA, acute mesenteric ischaemia, DKA*** [4] |
| **Epigastric** | High SBO (duodenal), GOO from pyloric stenosis (neonates) or gastric cancer (adults) | ***Acute pancreatitis, acute MI, perforated PUD*** [4] |

### G. Differential Diagnosis — Specific Scenarios

#### (i) DDx of Sigmoid Volvulus [3]

| DDx | Differentiating Features |
|:----|:------------------------|
| ***Toxic megacolon*** | ***Total or segmental colonic dilatation with systemic toxicity***; ***bloody diarrhoea***; history of IBD or ***C. difficile*** (antibiotic use) [3] |
| ***Ogilvie's syndrome*** | ***Acute dilatation without anatomic obstruction***; hospitalised, severely ill; ***abdominal distension is the most common presentation*** [3]; normal bowel sounds; gas in rectum |
| **Obstructing CRC** | Subacute history of change in bowel habit, weight loss; CT showing mass not volvulus |

#### (ii) DDx of Intussusception (Paediatric) [3]

| DDx | Differentiating Features |
|:----|:------------------------|
| ***Meckel's diverticulum*** | Painless massive PR bleeding (vs. painful colicky episodes in intussusception); ***Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan*** positive [3] |
| ***Malrotation with midgut volvulus*** | Bilious vomiting ± PR bleeding; typically neonatal; upper GI contrast diagnostic |
| ***Bacterial colitis*** | Diarrhoea predominant, infective contacts, stool cultures positive |
| ***Septic shock*** | Lethargy and coma may mimic the inter-episode lethargy of intussusception, but haemodynamic instability, fever, and septic markers distinguish [3] |
| ***Henoch-Schönlein purpura*** | Purpuric rash over buttocks/legs, arthralgia, haematuria; abdominal pain from bowel wall haematoma ± intussusception (HSP itself can cause intussusception) |

#### (iii) DDx of Neonatal IO [3]

| DDx | Differentiating Features |
|:----|:------------------------|
| ***Malrotation of gut*** | Bilious vomiting, may have minimal distension; upper GI contrast diagnostic |
| ***Hirschsprung's disease*** | Delayed meconium passage, abdominal distension, blast sign on PR; rectal biopsy confirmatory |
| ***Meconium ileus*** | Ground-glass appearance (Neuhauser sign) on AXR; association with CF; sweat chloride test |
| ***Intestinal atresia*** | Level-dependent presentation; double bubble (duodenal), triple bubble (jejunal), microcolon (ileal/colonic) |
| ***Meconium plug syndrome*** | Occurs in up to 1:500 newborns; colonic dysmotility or abnormal meconium consistency; often resolves with contrast enema [3] |
| ***Small left colon syndrome*** | ***Infant of diabetic mother***; transient left colon dysmotility; contrast enema shows small-calibre descending colon [3] |
| ***Internal anal sphincter achalasia*** | Similar to short-segment Hirschsprung; rectal biopsy shows normal ganglia (differentiates from HD) [3] |

### I. How to Differentiate Mechanical SBO from Paralytic Ileus from Pseudo-obstruction

This is a high-yield exam comparison. The key is to combine **clinical features**, **examination findings**, and **imaging**.

| Feature | Mechanical SBO | Paralytic Ileus | Pseudo-obstruction |
|:--------|:--------------|:---------------|:------------------|
| **Pain** | ***Colicky*** [1] — intermittent, cramping | Mild, diffuse, non-colicky | Distension but ***not much pain*** [4] |
| **Vomiting** | ***Profuse in SBO*** [4] | Present but less dramatic | Variable |
| **Distension** | Variable (depends on level) | Diffuse | Often marked |
| **Constipation** | Complete (obstipation) if complete obstruction | Variable; may pass flatus | Variable |
| **Bowel sounds** | ***Increased*** [1] — high-pitched, tinkling (early); absent (late, if strangulation) | ***Hypoactive or absent*** [4] | ***Normal*** [4] |
| **PR examination** | Empty, collapsed rectum | Variable | ***Dilated rectum*** [4] |
| **AXR** | Dilated proximal loops + collapsed distal; transition point; absent rectal gas | Diffuse gas throughout SB and LB; no transition point | Dilated colon; ***gas present in rectum*** [4] |
| **CT abdomen** | Transition point identified; proximal dilatation, distal collapse | No transition point; diffuse dilatation | Dilated colon, no mechanical cause |
| **History** | Prior surgery, hernia, malignancy | Recent operation, peritonitis, metabolic disorder, drugs | Hospitalised, severely ill, metabolic disturbance |

### J. Red Flags in the Differential — When to Suspect Strangulation

Any patient with suspected IO who develops the following should be considered to have strangulated obstruction until proven otherwise — this changes the differential from "which cause?" to "emergent surgery NOW":

| Red Flag | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:---------|:------------------------|
| Constant (non-colicky) pain | Continuous ischaemic injury to bowel wall irritating peritoneum |
| ***Tachycardia and hypotension*** [7] | Hypovolaemia + sepsis from bacterial translocation |
| Fever, leucocytosis | Systemic inflammatory response to ischaemic/necrotic bowel |
| Metabolic acidosis / raised lactate | Anaerobic metabolism in ischaemic bowel tissue; lactate is a sensitive marker of bowel ischaemia |
| ***Peritoneal signs*** (guarding, rigidity, rebound) [7] | Parietal peritoneum irritated by transmural necrosis or perforation |
| Bloody PR discharge | Mucosal sloughing from ischaemic bowel |
| Absent bowel sounds | Bowel has become non-viable → no peristaltic activity |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis of IO">

1. **First question**: Is it truly IO or a mimic? (Pancreatitis, mesenteric ischaemia, DKA, peritonitis, GE, urinary retention can all mimic IO)

2. **Second question**: Mechanical or functional? — Differentiate by bowel sounds (↑↑ = mechanical; ↓/absent = ileus; normal = pseudo-obstruction), PR exam (empty rectum = mechanical LBO; dilated = pseudo-obstruction), and imaging (transition point = mechanical)

3. **Third question**: If mechanical, SBO or LBO? — SBO: ***ABC (Adhesions, Bulge/hernia, Cancer)***; LBO: ***Cancer, Volvulus, Diverticular stricture, Pseudo-obstruction***

4. **Neonatal IO**: ***Bilious vomiting = malrotation with midgut volvulus until proven otherwise***. DDx includes intestinal atresia, meconium disease, Hirschsprung's disease, NEC.

5. **Sigmoid volvulus DDx**: Toxic megacolon (systemic toxicity, bloody diarrhoea, C. difficile) vs. Ogilvie's (hospitalised, normal bowel sounds, dilated rectum, gas in rectum)

6. **Always check**: hernial orifices, surgical scars, medications (opioids, anticholinergics), metabolic panel (K⁺, TFT, glucose), strangulation signs (constant pain, peritonism, fever, lactate)
