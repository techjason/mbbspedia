## I. Definition

> **Intestinal obstruction (IO)** refers to any condition that impedes the normal passage (aboral progress) of intestinal contents through the gastrointestinal tract.

This can occur by two fundamentally different mechanisms [1]:

1. ***Mechanical obstruction*** — implies a **physical barrier to the aboral progress of intestinal contents** (i.e., peristalsis is present and working *against* an obstruction) [1]
2. ***Ileus (functional obstruction)*** — implies **failure of peristalsis to propel intestinal contents with no mechanical barrier** [1]

The distinction matters enormously because management is completely different: mechanical obstruction often requires surgical intervention, whereas functional obstruction is usually managed conservatively by treating the underlying cause.

---

## II. Epidemiology

- ***Intestinal obstruction is a common surgical emergency*** [3]
- ***Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is more common and is involved in ~80% of cases of mechanical IO*** [3]
- ***Large bowel obstruction (LBO) accounts for about 15% of intestinal obstruction*** [1]
- ***LBO usually occurs at the sigmoid colon*** [1]
- SBO accounts for approximately 12–16% of all surgical admissions and ~20% of all emergency surgical admissions worldwide
- In Hong Kong, adhesive SBO is extremely common given the high volume of prior abdominal surgery; however, incarcerated hernias (particularly inguinal hernias) remain a leading cause in the elderly population
- In neonates, ***congenital anomalies*** — including ***intestinal atresia, malrotation, meconium disease, and Hirschsprung's disease*** — are the predominant causes [2]

### Age-specific patterns

| Age Group | Common Causes |
|:----------|:-------------|
| Neonates (0–28 days) | Intestinal atresia, malrotation with volvulus, meconium ileus, Hirschsprung's disease, anorectal malformations |
| Infants (1–36 months) | ***Intussusception*** (most common abdominal emergency in early childhood), incarcerated inguinal hernia |
| Children | Incarcerated hernia, adhesions, intussusception |
| Adults | Adhesions (~60–74%), hernias (~10%), neoplasm (~5%), Crohn's disease (~7%) for SBO [1]; colorectal cancer, volvulus, diverticular stricture for LBO |
| Elderly | Colorectal cancer (***15–20% of patients with colorectal cancer present with IO*** [1]), sigmoid volvulus, incarcerated hernia, faecal impaction |

---

## III. Risk Factors

Understanding risk factors is essentially understanding "what predisposes the bowel to being blocked or to stopping working."

### Medical History [3][4]
- **Hernia** — an incarcerated hernia traps bowel within it, creating obstruction
- **Abdominal infection or inflammation** — leads to adhesion formation or stricturing (e.g., Crohn's disease, tuberculosis, diverticulitis)
- **Abdominal malignancy** — intraluminal growth narrows the lumen; peritoneal carcinomatosis causes extrinsic compression
- **Previous intestinal obstruction** — recurrence risk is high, especially with adhesive disease (~30% recurrence)

### Surgical History [3][4]
- **Previous abdominal or pelvic surgery** — the single biggest risk factor for adhesive SBO; any peritoneal breach triggers an inflammatory-fibrotic healing cascade
- **Previous abdominal irradiation** — causes radiation enteritis → stricture formation from fibrosis (***radiation injury accounts for ~1% of SBO*** [1])

### Drug History [3][4]
- **Opiates** — activate μ-receptors on myenteric plexus → ↓ acetylcholine release → ↓ propulsive peristalsis
- **Anti-cholinergics** (anti-histamines, anti-spasmodics, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics) — block muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle → ↓ peristalsis

### Other Risk Factors
- **Chronic constipation** — predisposes to faecal impaction (LBO), sigmoid volvulus (by distending and elongating the sigmoid)
- **High-fibre diet in certain populations** — bulky stools can predispose to sigmoid volvulus
- **Bedbound / immobility** — predisposes to pseudo-obstruction and volvulus
- **Metabolic derangements** — hypokalaemia, hypothyroidism, uraemia → all impair smooth muscle contractility
- **Pregnancy** — hormonal laxity of ligaments, physical compression by gravid uterus

## IV. Anatomy and Function Relevant to Intestinal Obstruction

### A. Small Bowel

The small bowel (duodenum → jejunum → ileum) is approximately 6–7 metres long and is the primary site of nutrient absorption and fluid handling.

- **Blood supply**: Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) via jejunal, ileal and ileocolic branches
- **Mesentery**: The small bowel hangs from a mesentery attached to the posterior abdominal wall; this mobility makes it susceptible to adhesive kinking, volvulus, and herniation
- **Wall layers**: Mucosa → submucosa → muscularis propria (inner circular, outer longitudinal) → serosa
- **Nerve supply**: Myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus between the muscle layers controls peristalsis; submucosal (Meissner's) plexus controls secretion and absorption
  - This is why functional obstruction (paralytic ileus) involves *neuromuscular failure* of these plexuses

**Key anatomical points**:
- The **duodenojejunal flexure (ligament of Treitz)** is the landmark dividing proximal from distal SBO; obstruction proximal to this causes early bilious vomiting
- The ***terminal ileum is the narrowest portion of the small bowel*** (approximately 2 feet proximal to the ileocaecal valve), which is why gallstones (gallstone ileus) and other intraluminal objects typically impact here [4]
- ***A lesion at the ileocaecal valve presents as small bowel obstruction*** [1]

### B. Large Bowel

The large bowel (caecum → ascending → transverse → descending → sigmoid → rectum) is approximately 1.5 metres long; its primary functions are water absorption and faecal storage.

- **Blood supply**: SMA (caecum to proximal 2/3 of transverse colon) and IMA (distal 1/3 of transverse to rectum)
- **Unique anatomy**:
  - **Taeniae coli** — three longitudinal muscle bands (rather than a complete layer) leaving the wall structurally weaker between them
  - **Haustra** — sacculations between the taeniae
  - These structural features are why ***diverticula form at the weakest point where vasa recta penetrate the circular muscle*** [4]
- **Sigmoid colon** — has its own mesentery (mesosigmoid), making it mobile and prone to volvulus; also has the ***narrowest lumen → highest intraluminal pressure (Laplace's law)*** [4]
- The ***rectum is never affected by diverticula*** because its outer longitudinal muscle is a complete circumferential layer [4]

### C. The Ileocaecal Valve

This is a critical structure in IO:
- ***Competence of the ileocaecal valve determines the clinical features of distal colon obstruction*** [1]
- **Competent valve** (~1/3 of population): prevents retrograde flow of colonic contents into the ileum → creates a ***closed-loop obstruction*** between the valve and the distal obstruction → rapid caecal distension → high risk of perforation (especially when caecal diameter > 9–12 cm, per Laplace's law: T = P × r, so the caecum, having the largest radius, is most prone to perforation)
- **Incompetent valve** (~2/3 of population): allows decompression of colonic contents retrograde into the small bowel → presents with features more like SBO (distension, vomiting)

### D. Neonatal Anatomy

***Embryonic development of the gut*** [3] is critical to understanding neonatal causes:
- The GI tract is derived from **foregut** (oesophagus to mid-duodenum), **midgut** (mid-duodenum to proximal 2/3 transverse colon), and **hindgut** (distal 1/3 transverse colon to upper anal canal)
- The midgut undergoes a complex 270° counter-clockwise rotation around the SMA during weeks 4–12 of gestation
- Arrest of this rotation → ***malrotation*** → predisposes to midgut volvulus (a surgical emergency)
- ***Neural crest cells migrate craniocaudally during weeks 4–7*** of gestation to form the enteric ganglia; failure of this migration → ***Hirschsprung's disease*** [3]

<Callout title="Anatomy Pearl" type="idea">
The caecum is the most likely site of perforation in LBO with a competent ileocaecal valve because it has the largest diameter. By Laplace's law (Wall Tension = Pressure × Radius), the caecum experiences the greatest wall tension for any given intraluminal pressure.

## V. Etiology

The causes of intestinal obstruction are best organised by:
1. **Mechanism**: Mechanical vs. Functional
2. **Level**: Small bowel vs. Large bowel
3. **Relation to bowel wall**: Intraluminal vs. Intramural vs. Extramural (for mechanical causes)

### A. Mechanical Obstruction

#### (i) Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)

> ***Most common causes of SBO: Adhesions, Malignancy, and Hernias*** [3]. The mnemonic **"ABC"** — ***Adhesion, Bulge (hernia), Cancer*** — is a useful aide-mémoire [4].

##### Extramural (Extrinsic) Causes

| Cause | Pathophysiology | Notes |
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| ***Adhesions*** | ***Congenital; post-inflammation; formed after abdominal surgery*** [1]. Fibrous bands form during peritoneal healing after surgical trauma, infection, or radiation. These bands can kink, compress, or angulate bowel loops. | ***The most common cause of SBO in Western countries*** [1]. Accounts for ***~74% of SBO admissions*** [1]. Lower abdominal and pelvic surgery (appendicectomy, colorectal surgery, gynaecological surgery) carry highest risk. |
| ***Hernias*** | Bowel herniates through a defect (inguinal canal, femoral canal, umbilical ring, incisional site) and becomes trapped (incarcerated). If the bowel lumen is obstructed, it is "obstructed"; if blood supply is also compromised, it is "strangulated." | ***~3–10% of SBO*** [1][4]. ***Incarcerated hernias are the leading cause of complications (ischaemia, necrosis, perforation) related to bowel obstruction*** [3]. In children, ***incarcerated inguinal hernia is the MC surgical cause of SBO*** [4]. |
| ***Volvulus*** | Twisting of bowel around its mesentery → luminal obstruction + vascular compromise | Small bowel volvulus is less common than sigmoid; may occur in malrotation |
| ***Intraperitoneal malignancy*** | Extrinsic compression or carcinomatosis peritonei | Ovarian, gastric, colorectal secondaries |

##### Intramural Causes

| Cause | Pathophysiology | Notes |
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| ***Tumour (primary or secondary)*** | Lymphoma, GIST, adenocarcinoma grow within the bowel wall narrowing the lumen | ***~5% of SBO*** [1] |
| ***Strictures*** | Fibrotic narrowing from ***Crohn's disease, radiation, anastomotic scarring, drug-induced*** (e.g. NSAIDs, potassium chloride) | ***Crohn's disease accounts for ~7% of SBO*** [1] |
| ***Intussusception*** | A proximal segment of bowel (intussusceptum) telescopes into a distal segment (intussuscipiens). In adults, usually caused by a pathological lead point (polyp, tumour, Meckel's diverticulum). | Most common in infants 6–36 months (usually idiopathic) |

##### Intraluminal Causes

| Cause | Pathophysiology | Notes |
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| ***Foreign bodies*** | Physical blockage of the lumen | Ingested objects, bezoars |
| ***Gallstones (gallstone ileus)*** | A large gallstone erodes through the gallbladder wall into the adjacent duodenum via a ***cholecystoenteric fistula***, then impacts at the terminal ileum (narrowest part of SB). ***Bouveret's syndrome***: stone stuck at duodenum/stomach causing gastric outlet obstruction [4]. | ***Rigler's triad on AXR: pneumobilia + SBO + ectopic gallstone*** [4] |
| ***Bezoars*** | Accumulation of indigestible material — ***trichobezoar*** (hair), ***phytobezoar*** (plant fibre) | More common in patients with prior gastric surgery or gastroparesis |
| ***Worms*** | Masses of roundworms (Ascaris lumbricoides) can physically occlude the lumen | Endemic areas; less common in HK |
| ***Meconium ileus*** | Inspissated, sticky meconium in neonates with ***cystic fibrosis*** (thick secretions due to CFTR dysfunction) | Almost pathognomonic for CF in a neonate |

<Callout title="High Yield – SBO Etiology Data" type="idea">
From the landmark Miller et al. study referenced in the lecture slides [1]:
- Adhesions: 74% of patients / 68% of admissions
- Crohn's disease: 7% / 11%
- Neoplasm: 5% / 5%
- Hernia: 3% / 3%
- Radiation injury: 1% / 1%
</Callout>

#### (ii) Large Bowel Obstruction (LBO)

> ***Most common causes of LBO: Malignancy and Volvulus*** [3]. Specifically: ***Cancer, Volvulus, Diverticulitis, Stricture (anastomotic, radiation, ischaemic, endometriotic), Extrinsic compression (metastasis, pelvic/extraperitoneal tumour)*** [1].

| Cause | Pathophysiology | Notes |
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| ***Colorectal cancer*** | Intraluminal/intramural mass progressively narrows the colonic lumen. ***15–20% of patients with colorectal cancer present with intestinal obstruction*** [1]. | ***Characteristics: more advanced cancer, elderly patients with comorbidity, high operative mortality and morbidity, worse prognosis*** [1]. Most commonly at sigmoid (narrowest lumen). |
| ***Volvulus*** | Twisting of bowel around its mesentery → closed-loop obstruction + vascular compromise. ***Sigmoid volvulus (70%)*** is most common, followed by ***caecal volvulus (25%)*** [4]. | Sigmoid volvulus: older males, elongated mesosigmoid, chronic constipation. Caecal volvulus: younger females, congenital hypermobile caecum. |
| ***Diverticulitis*** | Acute inflammation → oedema → luminal narrowing. Chronic/recurrent → fibrotic stricture. | More common in sigmoid (Western) or right colon (Asia) |
| ***Stricture*** | ***Anastomotic, radiation, ischaemic, endometriotic*** [1] | Post-surgical stricture at anastomotic site; radiation enteritis/colitis causing fibrosis |
| ***Extrinsic compression*** | ***Metastasis, pelvic/extraperitoneal tumour*** [1] | Ovarian, uterine, prostatic malignancies |

#### (iii) Neonatal Causes of Intestinal Obstruction

***Congenital anomalies*** are the primary causes [2]:

| Cause | Key Features |
|:------|:------------|
| ***Intestinal atresia*** | ***Atresia can occur from oesophagus to anus*** [2]. Most common site is jejunum and ileum. Duodenal atresia associated with Down syndrome. |
| ***Malrotation*** | Arrest of normal 270° rotation → abnormal position of duodenojejunal junction and caecum → Ladd's bands may compress duodenum → predispose to midgut volvulus |
| ***Meconium disease*** | Meconium ileus (CF) — thick, inspissated meconium; Meconium plug syndrome — colonic dysmotility |
| ***Hirschsprung's disease*** | ***Absence of ganglion cells in distal bowel*** (from failed craniocaudal migration of neural crest cells) → functional obstruction of the aganglionic segment → proximal dilatation |

Additional neonatal causes include:
- **Anorectal malformations** (imperforate anus)
- **Incarcerated inguinal hernia** (especially in premature males)
- **Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC)** — primarily affects premature neonates
- **Small left colon syndrome** — occurs in infants of diabetic mothers

### B. Functional Obstruction (Non-mechanical)

#### (i) Paralytic Ileus

> ***Paralytic ileus*** = failure of transmission of peristaltic waves secondary to ***neuromuscular failure*** in the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus and submucosal (Meissner's) plexus [3].

| Category | Causes | Mechanism |
|:---------|:-------|:----------|
| ***Post-operative ileus*** | ***The most common cause*** [4]. | Any abdominal procedure causes peritoneal inflammation → inhibitory sympathetic reflexes + local inflammatory mediators (IL-6, prostaglandins) → paralysis of smooth muscle. ***A degree of paralytic ileus is common after any abdominal procedure with variable duration of 24–72 hours*** [3]. |
| ***Intra-peritoneal*** | ***Peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess*** [1] | Peritoneal inflammation activates inhibitory sympathetic pathways |
| ***Inflammatory/infective*** | ***Inflammatory/infective conditions*** [1] | Same mechanism as above |
| ***Intestinal ischaemia*** | | Ischaemic bowel cannot contract effectively |
| ***Retroperitoneal*** | ***Retroperitoneal haematoma/infection; aortic, spinal, urological operations; pancreatitis*** [1] | Retroperitoneal inflammation irritates the sympathetic chain/coeliac plexus → reflex ileus |
| **Reflex ileus** | ***Fracture of spine or ribs, retroperitoneal haemorrhage*** [3] | As above |
| **Metabolic** | ***Hypokalaemia, hypothyroidism***, uraemia, diabetic ketoacidosis | K⁺ is essential for smooth muscle repolarisation; ↓K⁺ → membrane hyperpolarisation → ↓contractility. Thyroid hormone maintains basal metabolic rate of smooth muscle. |
| **Drug-induced** | ***Opiates, anti-cholinergics*** [3] | Opiates: μ-receptor activation → ↓ACh release from myenteric plexus → ↓peristalsis. Anti-cholinergics: block muscarinic M₃ receptors on smooth muscle → ↓contraction. |

<Callout title="Post-operative Ileus Timeline" type="idea">
Normal return of bowel function post-operatively: ***Small bowel: hours; Stomach: 1–2 days; Colon: 3–5 days*** [4]. Post-operative ileus is **clinically significant if > 72 hours post-op** with no return of bowel sounds, no flatus, and abdominal distension [4].
</Callout>

#### (ii) Pseudo-obstruction

> ***Pseudo-obstruction*** = clinical picture of obstruction ***in the absence of a mechanical cause or intra-abdominal disease*** [3]. ***Obstruction in the absence of a mechanical cause*** — associated with ***underlying neuropathy or myopathy*** [3].

##### Acute Colonic Pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's Syndrome)

- ***Characterised by acute dilatation of the colon in the absence of an anatomic lesion that obstructs the flow of intestinal content*** [3]
- ***Occurs in hospitalised patients in association with a severe illness or after surgery and in conjunction with a metabolic imbalance or administration of medications*** [3]
- ***Abdominal distension is the most common clinical presentation*** [3]
- Pathophysiology: ***Autonomic imbalance (↓ parasympathetic / ↑ sympathetic) → aperistalsis*** [4]
- Aetiology: metabolic disturbance (DM, hypoK, hypothyroidism, uraemia), drugs (opioids, CCBs), trauma/post-op, neurological diseases (Parkinson's, MS) [4]

##### Chronic Colonic Pseudo-obstruction

- ***Toxic megacolon***: ***Characterised by total or segmental colonic dilatation with systemic toxicity*** [3]. Occurs as a complication of IBD, infectious colitis (***commonly associated with Clostridium difficile***), ischaemic colitis, volvulus, diverticulitis and obstructive colorectal cancer. ***Bloody diarrhoea is the most common clinical presentation*** [3].
- ***Hirschsprung's disease***: Chronic functional obstruction from aganglionic segment

##### Small Intestinal Pseudo-obstruction
- Idiopathic
- ***Familial visceral myopathy*** [3]

#### Differentiating Features: Pseudo-obstruction vs. Mechanical Obstruction [4]

| Feature | Pseudo-obstruction | Mechanical Obstruction |
|:--------|:------------------|:----------------------|
| Bowel sounds | ***Normal*** | High-pitched / tinkling (early); absent (late) |
| PR examination | ***Dilated rectum*** | Collapsed, empty rectum |
| Pain | Distension but ***not much pain*** | Colicky, significant |
| AXR | Gas in rectum present | Absent rectal gas |

## VI. Classification

Intestinal obstruction can be classified along several axes. This matters clinically because the classification determines urgency, likely cause, and management approach.

### A. Anatomical Classification [3]
- **Small bowel obstruction (SBO)**
- **Large bowel obstruction (LBO)**

### B. Mechanical vs. Functional Classification [3]
- **Mechanical** — peristalsis works *against* a physical barrier
- **Functional** — absence or inadequacy of peristalsis without mechanical barrier
  - Paralytic ileus
  - Pseudo-obstruction

### C. Completeness [1]
- ***Partial vs. Complete obstruction*** [1]
  - **Partial**: some gas/fluid still passes → patient may still pass flatus, diarrhoea may occur (overflow)
  - **Complete**: no passage of gas or stool → absolute constipation (obstipation)

### D. Chronicity [1]
- ***Chronic vs. Acute*** [1]
  - **Acute**: sudden onset, often surgical emergency
  - **Chronic**: insidious, often from slowly growing tumours or strictures; may have intermittent subacute episodes

### E. Complexity [1]
- ***Simple obstruction*** — ***obstruction of the lumen, usually at one point only*** [1]; blood supply intact
- ***Strangulating obstruction*** — ***blood supply to bowel impaired*** [1]; constitutes a surgical emergency due to risk of ischaemia, necrosis, perforation
- ***Closed-loop obstruction*** — ***lumen occlusion in at least 2 points*** [1]; a ***segment of intestine is obstructed in two locations creating a segment with no proximal or distal outlet*** [3]
  - ***Presents with minimal abdominal distension since only a short segment of intestine is distended*** [3]
  - ***Can rapidly lead to complications such as ischaemia, necrosis and perforation*** [3]
  - Examples: LBO with competent ileocaecal valve, volvulus, hernia containing a loop of bowel, ***afferent loop syndrome (post-Billroth II gastrectomy)*** [4]

### F. Relation to Bowel Wall (for mechanical causes) [3]
- **Intraluminal** (within the lumen)
- **Intramural** (within the wall)
- **Extramural** (outside the wall)

<Callout title="Strangulation vs. Simple Obstruction" type="error">
A common exam mistake is failing to distinguish simple from strangulating obstruction. **Strangulation** implies compromised blood supply and is a **time-critical surgical emergency**. Clinical clues to strangulation include: constant (non-colicky) pain, peritoneal signs (guarding, rebound), tachycardia, fever, leucocytosis, and metabolic acidosis with raised lactate. Do not wait for these signs to develop — if in doubt, operate early.

## VII. Pathophysiology

Understanding the pathophysiology of IO is essential because every clinical feature and complication can be traced back to these mechanisms.

### A. Proximal Dilatation [3][4]

When a mechanical obstruction occurs, the bowel proximal to the obstruction dilates due to:

1. **Accumulation of gas**:
   - ***Swallowed air*** (the major source; ~70% nitrogen which cannot be absorbed)
   - ***Bacterial fermentation*** — significant overgrowth of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms producing CO₂, H₂, and methane [3]
2. **Accumulation of fluid**:
   - ***Saliva, bile, pancreatic secretions, and gastric secretions*** [3] — the GI tract normally secretes 6–8 litres of fluid per day, most of which is reabsorbed. Obstruction prevents distal reabsorption → massive fluid accumulation in the proximal bowel
3. **Peristaltic response**:
   - ***Initially, increased peristalsis attempts to overcome the obstruction*** [4] — this is why early bowel sounds are high-pitched and hyperactive ("tinkling")
   - Eventually, the bowel fatigues and becomes atonic

### B. Distal Collapse [3][4]

- ***Bowel below the obstruction exhibits normal peristalsis and absorption*** [3]
- ***Eventually becomes empty and collapses*** [3]
- This is why PR examination in mechanical LBO typically reveals an ***empty, collapsed rectum*** (in contrast to the ***dilated rectum*** of pseudo-obstruction)

### C. Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance [3][4]

This is a major source of morbidity and mortality in IO:

| Mechanism | Explanation |
|:----------|:-----------|
| ***Decreased oral intake*** | Nausea, vomiting, and NPO status |
| ***Vomiting*** | ***Loss of fluid containing Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, H⁺*** [3] → **hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis** (loss of H⁺ and Cl⁻ from gastric secretions) |
| ***Defective intestinal absorption*** | Oedematous bowel wall cannot absorb water and electrolytes normally [4] |
| ***Fluid sequestration in bowel lumen*** | Fluid is trapped ("third-spacing") within the dilated bowel, effectively lost from the circulating volume |
| ***Transudation into peritoneal cavity*** | ***Transudation of fluid into extracellular space and peritoneal cavity*** [3] — increased hydrostatic pressure in congested bowel wall drives fluid into the peritoneum |

The net effect is **hypovolaemia** → tachycardia, hypotension, oliguria, prerenal AKI.

### D. Pathogenesis of Strangulation [3]

Strangulation represents the most dangerous evolution of IO:

1. ***Impaired venous and lymphatic return*** → ***venous and lymphatic congestion resulting in oedematous tissues*** [3]
   - Venous pressure rises → increased capillary hydrostatic pressure → oedema and haemorrhagic infarction of the bowel wall
2. ***Compromised arterial blood supply*** → ***bowel ischaemia, necrosis and subsequently perforation*** [3]
   - As intramural oedema worsens, even arterial inflow is eventually compressed
   - Ischaemic bowel loses its mucosal barrier → **bacterial translocation** across the bowel wall into the peritoneal cavity and bloodstream → peritonitis, sepsis, multi-organ failure

### E. Closed-loop Obstruction — Special Pathophysiology

In closed-loop obstruction (e.g., LBO with competent ileocaecal valve, volvulus):
- The trapped segment cannot decompress in either direction
- Intraluminal pressure rises rapidly
- The caecum (largest diameter) is at highest risk of perforation by **Laplace's law** (Wall Tension = Pressure × Radius)
- Caecal diameter > 9 cm on imaging is a warning sign; > 12 cm is considered critical with imminent perforation risk

### F. Systemic Consequences

## VIII. Clinical Features

> ***Cardinal features of IO = Abdominal pain + Distension + Vomiting + Absolute constipation*** [3]

The clinical presentation depends on the **level** (proximal vs. distal), **completeness** (partial vs. complete), **type** (simple vs. strangulating), and **duration** of obstruction.

### A. Symptoms

#### 1. Abdominal Pain

- ***Sudden onset*** [3]
- ***Colicky in nature*** — ***paroxysms of pain coinciding with increased peristaltic activity*** [3]
  - **Why colicky?** The bowel contracts vigorously trying to push contents past the obstruction → intermittent smooth muscle contraction → intermittent pain → relief between spasms
- ***Located in periumbilical region (small bowel) or infraumbilical (large bowel)*** [3]
  - **Why periumbilical for SBO?** The small bowel is a midgut-derived structure; visceral pain from the midgut is referred to the periumbilical region (T9–T10 dermatome)
  - **Why infraumbilical for LBO?** The hindgut-derived colon refers pain to the infraumbilical/suprapubic region (T11–L1 dermatome)
- ***Progression from cramping to more focal and constant pain may indicate peritoneal irritation related to complications such as bowel ischaemia and necrosis*** [3]
  - **Why does it become constant?** Ischaemic bowel causes *continuous* irritation of the visceral and then parietal peritoneum → constant, localised, somatic pain that is worsened by movement

#### 2. Vomiting

- ***The more distal the obstruction, the longer it takes for the onset of nausea and vomiting*** [3]
  - **Why?** In proximal SBO, the stomach fills quickly with regurgitated secretions → early vomiting. In distal SBO or LBO, there is a large capacitance reservoir that must fill before retrograde flow reaches the stomach.
- ***Character of vomitus changes from digested food to feculent material as obstruction progresses due to enteric bacterial overgrowth*** [3]
  - "Feculent" does not mean actual faeces — it is the foul-smelling product of bacterial fermentation in stagnant small bowel contents
- **Bilious vomiting** in a neonate is ***malrotation with midgut volvulus until proven otherwise*** — this is a ***surgical emergency*** [2][5]
- In proximal SBO: vomiting is **early, profuse, and bilious** → leads to rapid dehydration and metabolic alkalosis
- In LBO: vomiting is **late** and may be feculent; some patients never vomit

#### 3. Abdominal Distension

- ***The more distal the obstruction, the greater the distension*** [3]
  - **Why?** More bowel length is available proximal to the obstruction for gas and fluid accumulation
- Proximal SBO: minimal or absent distension (short segment of bowel proximal to obstruction)
- Distal SBO: moderate distension
- LBO: marked, generalised distension (entire colon and potentially ileum if valve is incompetent)

#### 4. Absolute Constipation (Obstipation)

- ***Inability to pass faeces and flatus*** [3]
- ***Feature of complete intestinal obstruction*** [3]
- **Why?** In complete obstruction, nothing passes the obstruction point → distal bowel empties its residual contents → then nothing more can pass
- In **partial** obstruction, some flatus or even diarrhoea may still be present (overflow diarrhoea)
- Note: patients may pass stool/flatus from bowel *distal* to the obstruction in the early hours — this does NOT exclude obstruction

#### Summary: Clinical Presentation by Level

| Feature | Proximal SBO | Distal SBO | LBO |
|:--------|:-------------|:-----------|:----|
| Pain | Periumbilical, colicky, frequent | Periumbilical, colicky | Infraumbilical, colicky; may be less intense initially |
| Vomiting | Early, profuse, bilious | Later onset, may become feculent | Late or absent; if present, feculent |
| Distension | Minimal/absent | Moderate | Marked |
| Constipation | Late | Present | Early and prominent |
| Dehydration | Severe (early vomiting) | Moderate | Less prominent initially |

### B. Signs

#### 1. General Examination

- **Dehydration**: dry mucous membranes, decreased skin turgor, sunken eyes, tachycardia, hypotension
  - *Why?* Loss of fluid from vomiting, third-spacing, and reduced oral intake
- **Tachycardia**: may be from dehydration or pain; persistent tachycardia with fever raises concern for strangulation/sepsis
- **Fever**: suggests strangulation, perforation, or intra-abdominal sepsis
- **Hernia sites must be examined** — always check groin (inguinal and femoral), umbilical, and any surgical scars for incisional hernias
  - ***Incarcerated hernias are the leading cause of complications related to bowel obstruction*** [3]

#### 2. Abdominal Inspection

- **Distension**: as described above; assess degree
- **Surgical scars**: suggest adhesive obstruction
- **Visible peristalsis**: may be visible through the abdominal wall in thin patients with SBO — represents hyperperistalsis of bowel proximal to obstruction trying to overcome it ("ladder pattern")
- **Hernia orifices**: groin, umbilicus, incisional sites

#### 3. Abdominal Palpation

- **Tenderness**:
  - Mild diffuse tenderness is common in uncomplicated IO
  - ***Localised tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness*** → suggests **peritonism** from strangulation, ischaemia, or perforation
  - A **tender, irreducible lump at a hernia site** = obstructed/strangulated hernia until proven otherwise
- **Palpable mass**: may represent the obstructing lesion (tumour), distended closed-loop, or intussusception ("sausage-shaped mass" in the RUQ in paediatric intussusception)

#### 4. Abdominal Percussion

- **Tympanic (hyper-resonant)**: due to gas-filled, distended bowel loops
- **Shifting dullness**: suggests free peritoneal fluid (ascites from transudation)

#### 5. Auscultation

- **Early / Simple obstruction**: ***High-pitched, tinkling bowel sounds*** — "borborygmi" — representing hyperactive peristalsis trying to overcome the obstruction
- **Late / Strangulation**: ***Absent bowel sounds*** — the bowel has fatigued or become necrotic → no more peristalsis
- ***Paralytic ileus: hypoactive or absent bowel sounds*** [4]
- ***Pseudo-obstruction: normal bowel sounds*** [4] — this is a key differentiating feature

#### 6. Digital Rectal Examination (PR)

- **Essential in every patient with suspected IO**
- **Empty rectum** in mechanical LBO (distal bowel has been evacuated)
- ***Dilated rectum*** in pseudo-obstruction [4]
- May reveal:
  - A rectal mass (colorectal cancer)
  - Blood on glove ("redcurrant jelly" mucus in intussusception; blood from ischaemic mucosa)
  - Faecal impaction
  - An empty ballooned rectum in Hirschsprung's disease (after which a gush of stool/gas may be released — "blast sign")

### C. Special Clinical Features by Cause

#### Strangulated Obstruction — Warning Signs

| Sign | Mechanism |
|:-----|:---------|
| Constant (non-colicky) pain | Continuous ischaemic irritation of peritoneum |
| Peritonism (guarding, rigidity, rebound) | Peritoneal inflammation from ischaemia/necrosis/perforation |
| Tachycardia, fever | Systemic inflammatory response/sepsis |
| Leucocytosis | Inflammatory response |
| Metabolic acidosis / Raised lactate | Anaerobic metabolism in ischaemic bowel |
| Bloody PR | Mucosal sloughing from ischaemic bowel |

#### Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction — Key Features [2][5]

***Bilious vomiting in a neonate is malrotation with midgut volvulus until proven otherwise*** — it is a ***surgical emergency*** [2][5].

| Feature | Significance |
|:--------|:------------|
| ***Bilious (green) vomiting*** | Obstruction distal to ampulla of Vater; think malrotation with midgut volvulus as the most dangerous cause |
| ***Non-bilious projectile vomiting*** | Obstruction proximal to ampulla; think pyloric stenosis (if 2–8 weeks old) or oesophageal/proximal duodenal atresia |
| ***Failure to pass meconium within 24–48 hours*** | Think Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, anorectal malformation |
| ***Abdominal distension*** | Lower obstruction (ileal/colonic); may be absent in proximal obstruction |
| ***"Double bubble" sign on AXR*** | Duodenal atresia (dilated stomach + proximal duodenum, no distal gas if complete) |

#### Intussusception (Paediatric) — Classic Triad [3]

1. **Colicky abdominal pain** — episodic screaming with drawing up of legs, child appears well between episodes
2. **"Redcurrant jelly" stools** — bloody mucus per rectum from venous congestion and mucosal ischaemia of the intussuscepted segment
3. **"Sausage-shaped" mass** — usually palpable in the RUQ (because the ileocolic intussusception pushes along the course of the colon)
4. **"Dance sign"** — emptiness in the RIF (because the caecum has been dragged upwards)

#### Sigmoid Volvulus — Classic Features [4]
- Elderly, male, institutionalised/bedbound patient with chronic constipation
- Massive abdominal distension (often asymmetric)
- ***Coffee bean sign on AXR*** — dilated sigmoid arising from pelvis/LLQ, ahaustral, with 3 lines of sigmoid wall converging at the twist point [4]
- ***Bird's beak sign on contrast enema*** — tapering of contrast at the twist point [4]
- ***Whirl sign on CT*** [4]

<Callout title="Don't Forget Hernia Orifices!" type="error">
A common exam and clinical pitfall is forgetting to examine all hernia orifices (bilateral inguinal, femoral, umbilical, and incisional sites) in a patient presenting with intestinal obstruction. An ***incarcerated hernia*** can cause bowel obstruction and is easily missed if the groin is not exposed. **Always check the groin** — especially in elderly patients presenting with SBO.

## IX. Neonatal Intestinal Obstruction — Detailed Pathophysiology by Cause

Given the emphasis in the lecture slides [2][5][6], let us elaborate on the major neonatal causes:

### A. Intestinal Atresia [3]

- ***Atresia is a congenital defect of a hollow viscus that results in complete obstruction of the lumen*** [3]
- ***One of the most frequent causes of bowel obstruction in newborns*** [3]
- ***Most commonly affected site: jejunum and ileum (jejunoileal atresia)***; least common: colon [3]
- ***Duodenal atresia causes complete obstruction; duodenal stenosis causes partial obstruction only*** [3]

**Pathogenesis**: Two theories depending on location:
- **Duodenal atresia**: Failure of recanalization — during weeks 4–8 of gestation, the duodenal lumen becomes obliterated by epithelial proliferation and then normally recanalizes. If this fails → atresia or stenosis.
- **Jejunoileal atresia**: Vascular accident — an in-utero mesenteric vascular insult (thrombosis, volvulus, intussusception) causes segmental ischaemic necrosis → resorption → atresia. This is why jejunoileal atresia is NOT associated with other congenital anomalies (unlike duodenal atresia).

**Classification** (Grosfeld) [3]:
- ***Type I (mucosal web)***: Intact bowel wall with intraluminal mucosal membrane
- ***Type II (fibrous cord)***: Atretic ends connected by fibrous cord, mesentery intact
- ***Type IIIa (mesenteric gap defect)***: Atretic ends separated by a V-shaped mesenteric gap
- ***Type IIIb (apple-peel / Christmas tree)***: Proximal jejunal atresia with the distal bowel spiralling around a single SMA branch — carries high mortality
- ***Type IV (multiple atresia)***: Multiple atretic segments ("string of sausages")
- ***Type III is the most common; Type I is the least common*** [3]

**Associations** [3]:
- ***Duodenal atresia***: Down syndrome (trisomy 21) — ~30%; cardiac, renal, vertebral, biliary anomalies
- ***Jejunoileal atresia***: Cystic fibrosis (meconium ileus)
- ***Colonic atresia***: Hirschsprung's disease

### B. Malrotation [3][5][6]

- ***Intestinal malrotation occurs when normal rotation of the embryonic gut is arrested or disturbed during in utero development*** [3]
- ***Majority of patients present during neonatal period or within the first year of life*** [3]

**Normal embryology** [3]:
1. Weeks 4–5: Rapid growth of midgut → physiological herniation through the umbilicus
2. Weeks 6–10: The midgut undergoes a 270° counter-clockwise rotation around the SMA axis
3. Week 10–12: Return to abdomen with the duodenojejunal junction fixing to the left of midline (at the ligament of Treitz) and the caecum fixing in the RIF; the mesentery then fuses broadly to the posterior abdominal wall

**What goes wrong in malrotation**:
- The rotation is incomplete → the duodenojejunal junction fails to reach its normal position → the caecum fails to descend to the RIF
- **Ladd's bands**: Peritoneal bands extend from the malpositioned caecum across the duodenum to fix in the RUQ → extrinsic compression of the duodenum
- **Narrow mesenteric base**: The unfixed mesentery has a dangerously narrow pedicle → the entire midgut can twist around the SMA → ***midgut volvulus*** → catastrophic midgut ischaemia if not corrected within hours

**Associated conditions** [3]: CDH (~100%), CHD (40–90%), heterotaxy syndrome, omphalocele (31–45%), gastroschisis, intestinal atresia, oesophageal atresia, biliary atresia, Meckel's diverticulum

### C. Hirschsprung's Disease [3]

- "Hirschsprung" → named after Harald Hirschsprung who described it in 1886
- ***Occurs in 1 in 5000 live births; male predominance (M:F = 3:1 to 4:1)*** [3]
- ***Predominant gene: RET proto-oncogene*** — loss-of-function mutation → impaired neural crest cell migration and differentiation [3]

**Pathogenesis** [3]:
- ***Defect in craniocaudal migration of neuroblasts from the neural crest***
- Migration begins at ***week 4 and should reach the distal colon by week 7*** of gestation [3]
- ***Failure of cells to reach the distal colon leaves that segment aganglionic and therefore non-functional*** [3]
- The aganglionic segment remains tonically contracted (because ganglia normally provide inhibitory relaxation via NO and VIP) → functional obstruction → proximal bowel dilates

**Clinical features** [3]:
- Failure to pass meconium within 24–48 hours of birth (90% of neonates with HD)
- Abdominal distension
- Bilious vomiting
- "Blast sign" on PR: explosive release of gas and stool when the examining finger is withdrawn
- Later presentation: chronic constipation in children (short-segment disease)
- Complication: **Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC)** — explosive, foul-smelling diarrhoea, abdominal distension, fever, sepsis → can be life-threatening

### D. Intussusception [3]

- ***Intussusception = invagination (telescoping) of a part of intestine into itself*** [3]
- ***Most common abdominal emergency in early childhood*** [3]
- ***Most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants between 6–36 months*** [3]
- ***Male predominance (M:F = 3:2)*** [3]
- ***Location: most often at ileocaecal junction (ileocolic intussusception)*** [3]

**Pathogenesis** [3]:
- ***Idiopathic (75%)***: Hypertrophy of Peyer's patches in lymphoid-rich terminal ileum secondary to viral infection (URTI, gastroenteritis) acts as a lead point
- ***Pathological lead point*** (more common in adults or children > 6 years): Meckel's diverticulum, polyps, lymphoma, duplication cysts, HSP
- The intussusceptum (proximal segment) drags into the intussuscipiens (distal segment) → venous congestion → mucosal oedema and haemorrhage → "redcurrant jelly" stool → if untreated, arterial compromise → necrosis → perforation

## X. Closed-Loop Obstruction — Special Entities

### A. Hernia-related Closed-Loop Obstruction [3][4]

- **Definitions** [4]:
  - ***Reducible***: hernia contents can be returned to the abdomen
  - ***Incarcerated***: contents are trapped but the bowel lumen is not obstructed
  - ***Obstructed***: bowel lumen is obstructed (closed-loop IO) but blood supply intact
  - ***Strangulated***: blood supply also compromised → ischaemia → gangrene
  - ***Richter's hernia***: only one sidewall of bowel is incarcerated → ischaemia without obstruction [4]
  - ***Reduction-en-masse***: apparently reducing the sac but did not push contents out → still strangulated [4]
- ***Incidence of strangulation: femoral > indirect inguinal > direct inguinal*** [4]

### B. Gallstone Ileus [4]

- ***Gallstone erodes through the GB into adjacent bowel through a cholecystoenteric fistula*** [4]
- ***Bouveret's syndrome***: stone stuck at duodenum/stomach → GOO [4]
- ***Cholecystoduodenal fistula (MC)***: stone travels through SB → impacts at ***terminal ileum, 2 feet proximal to the ileocaecal valve*** (narrowest part of SB) [4]
- ***AXR: Rigler's triad — pneumobilia + SBO + ectopic gallstone (usually in RIF)*** [4]
- Management: ***Enterolithotomy*** — exploratory laparotomy → ***proximal enterotomy (NOT over the stone because of ulceration)*** → ***milk the stone proximally for extraction*** [4]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: IO = any impediment to aboral passage of intestinal contents. Mechanical (physical barrier) vs. Functional (ileus/pseudo-obstruction).

**Epidemiology**: SBO accounts for ~80% of mechanical IO. LBO ~15%. Most common causes: SBO = adhesions > hernia > cancer; LBO = cancer > volvulus > diverticulitis.

**Risk Factors**: Prior surgery (adhesions), hernia, malignancy, medications (opiates, anticholinergics), metabolic (hypoK, hypothyroid).

**Pathophysiology cascade**: Obstruction → proximal dilatation (gas + fluid) → ↑ intraluminal pressure → venous congestion → oedema → arterial compromise → ischaemia → necrosis → perforation → peritonitis/sepsis. Dehydration from vomiting, third-spacing, impaired absorption.

**Cardinal Features (4)**: Pain (colicky → constant if strangulation), Vomiting (early in proximal SBO; late/feculent in distal), Distension (greater with distal obstruction), Absolute constipation (complete obstruction).

**Key Signs**: Dehydration, high-pitched tinkling bowel sounds (early) → absent (late), abdominal tenderness (peritonism = strangulation), empty rectum on PR (mechanical LBO), visible peristalsis, hernial orifices must be checked.

**Closed-loop obstruction**: Obstruction at 2 points, rapid ischaemia risk. Examples: LBO + competent ileocaecal valve, volvulus, hernia.

**Neonatal IO**: Bilious vomiting = malrotation with midgut volvulus until proven otherwise. Key causes: intestinal atresia, malrotation, meconium disease, Hirschsprung's disease.

**Classification**: By anatomy (SBO/LBO), mechanism (mechanical/functional), completeness (partial/complete), complexity (simple/strangulating/closed-loop), relation to wall (intra/intramural/extramural).
