## Differential Diagnosis of a Sellar / Pituitary Mass

### Why Differential Diagnosis Matters Here

When you discover a mass in or around the sella turcica — whether on MRI done for headache, visual complaints, hormonal disturbance, or incidentally — you **cannot assume it is a pituitary adenoma**. The sella and parasellar region is a crossroads of diverse embryological, vascular, and neural structures, each capable of producing its own pathology. Getting the differential right determines whether you give a dopamine agonist (prolactinoma), rush to surgery (apoplexy, craniopharyngioma), or treat an infection (abscess, TB). The clinical approach is to integrate **three axes**: (1) the imaging characteristics, (2) the hormonal profile, and (3) the clinical context (age, sex, tempo of onset, associated features) [2][3].

### Systematic Framework: Differential Diagnosis of a Sellar Mass

The way to think about this systematically is to categorise by **pathological process** — exactly as Felix's notes lay it out, but with the "why" for each entity [2]:

### Category-by-Category Differential with Distinguishing Features

#### 1. Pituitary Hyperplasia (Not a Tumour — Reactive Process)

***Pituitary hyperplasia*** [2] must be distinguished from a true adenoma because the management is entirely different — you treat the **underlying cause**, not the gland.

| Type | Trigger | Mechanism (First Principles) | Clinical Clue |
|:-----|:--------|:----------------------------|:--------------|
| ***Lactotroph hyperplasia*** | ***Pregnancy*** | Oestrogen stimulates lactotroph proliferation; pituitary can enlarge up to 2× during pregnancy — this is **physiological** | History of pregnancy or postpartum; prolactin mildly elevated but proportional to pregnancy stage |
| ***Thyrotroph hyperplasia*** | ***Longstanding primary hypothyroidism*** | Loss of T4/T3 negative feedback → persistent TRH stimulation → thyrotroph proliferation. The gland enlarges diffusely and can mimic a macroadenoma | ↑ TSH with ↓ fT4; may resolve completely with thyroxine replacement — **always check TFTs before operating on a sellar mass** |
| ***Gonadotroph hyperplasia*** | ***Longstanding primary hypogonadism*** | Loss of sex steroid negative feedback → persistent GnRH stimulation → gonadotroph proliferation | History of Turner's, Klinefelter's, or premature ovarian insufficiency; elevated LH/FSH |
| ***Somatotroph hyperplasia*** | ***Ectopic GHRH secretion*** (e.g., bronchial carcinoid, pancreatic NET) | Ectopic tumour secretes GHRH → chronic somatotroph stimulation → hyperplasia (not autonomous) | Acromegaly features **plus** elevated GHRH levels; peripheral tumour on imaging |

<Callout title="Critical Teaching Point" type="error">
**Always measure thyroid function before diagnosing a pituitary macroadenoma!** A patient with longstanding primary hypothyroidism can develop thyrotroph hyperplasia so significant that the pituitary enlarges and mimics a macroadenoma. Starting thyroxine replacement shrinks the gland. Unnecessary surgery would be a disaster.
</Callout>

#### 2. Pituitary Adenoma (PitNET) — The Most Common Sellar Mass

***Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause of sellar masses from the 3rd decade onwards*** [2]. These are **monoclonal neoplasms** of anterior pituitary cells.

How to differentiate **between adenoma subtypes** is essentially a hormonal exercise (covered in diagnostics). The key here is distinguishing adenoma from non-adenoma sellar pathology:

- **MRI features**: Arises **within** the pituitary gland (intrasellar origin). On gadolinium-enhanced MRI, adenomas take up contrast ***to a lesser degree than the normal pituitary but more than surrounding CNS*** [2]. ***If a sellar lesion can be seen as separate from the normal pituitary gland, this indicates the mass is NOT a pituitary adenoma*** [2] — think craniopharyngioma, meningioma, Rathke's cyst.
- **Prolactin level** helps distinguish prolactinoma from stalk effect (see Part 1).

#### 3. Other Benign Tumours of the Sellar/Parasellar Region

##### a. Craniopharyngioma

***Craniopharyngioma*** [2] — derived from embryological remnants of **Rathke's pouch** (the oral ectoderm invagination that forms the anterior pituitary). The name: "cranio-" = skull, "pharynge-" = pharynx (reflecting Rathke's pouch origin from the stomodeum/roof of the mouth), "-oma" = tumour.

| Feature | Detail |
|:--------|:-------|
| Location | **Suprasellar** predominantly (though can be intra/infrasellar) |
| Age | **Bimodal**: 5–14 years and 50–74 years |
| Histology | Two types: **Adamantinomatous** (children, calcification, cystic "machine oil" fluid) and **Papillary** (adults, rarely calcify) |
| Imaging | ***Calcification*** seen in ~90% of paediatric and ~50% of adult cases; ***calcification in a craniopharyngioma or meningioma is seen better by CT scan than by MRI*** [2]. Cystic + solid components; **does not arise from within the pituitary gland** (separate from normal gland on MRI). |
| Clinical | ***Failure to thrive*** (in children) [1]; visual field defects; hypopituitarism; DI (hypothalamic involvement); raised ICP in children (hydrocephalus) |
| Behaviour | ***Histologically benign but aggressive growth*** — tendency to recur [3] |

> ***Craniopharyngioma: Failure to Thrive*** — this is the classic paediatric presentation [1]. Growth failure from GH deficiency plus hypothalamic dysfunction (appetite, temperature dysregulation).

<Callout title="Craniopharyngioma vs Pituitary Adenoma — Key Differentiators" type="idea">

| Feature | Pituitary Adenoma | Craniopharyngioma |
|:--------|:-----------------|:------------------|
| Origin | Within the pituitary gland | Separate from the pituitary (Rathke's pouch remnant) |
| Calcification | Very rare | Common (90% children, 50% adults) |
| Cystic component | Uncommon (unless apoplexy) | Very common ("machine oil") |
| Age | Adults (3rd decade+) | Bimodal (children + older adults) |
| DI | Uncommon pre-operatively | Common (hypothalamic involvement) |
| CT usefulness | Limited (MRI is best) | Calcification seen better on CT |
</Callout>

##### b. Meningioma

***Meningioma*** [1][3] — arises from **arachnoidal cap cells** of the meninges. In the sellar region, it arises from the **tuberculum sellae**, **diaphragma sellae**, or **cavernous sinus**.

- ***Primary extra-axial tumour: meningioma accounts for 80% of extra-axial primary brain tumours*** [3].
- **Imaging**: Dural-based, **dural tail sign** on MRI (thickening of dura extending from the tumour); may calcify (***CT better for calcification*** [2]); homogeneous intense enhancement with gadolinium (brighter than adenomas).
- **Key differentiator from adenoma**: meningioma is **separate from** the pituitary gland and is dural-based. It displaces the gland rather than arising from within it.
- Can cause visual disturbance and CN palsies via similar mechanisms as adenoma (optic chiasm/cavernous sinus compression).

***Middle cranial fossa tumours include: meningioma, schwannoma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma*** [3].

##### c. Pituicytoma

- Rare tumour arising from **pituicytes** (glial cells of the posterior pituitary/stalk).
- Presents similarly to non-functioning adenoma (mass effect, hypopituitarism).
- Distinguished by location (posterior pituitary/infundibulum) and histology.

#### 4. Malignant Tumours

##### a. Primary Malignancies

| Tumour | Key Features | Why It Enters the Differential |
|:-------|:-------------|:-------------------------------|
| ***Pituitary carcinoma*** | ***Extremely rare***; defined ONLY by the presence of **craniospinal or systemic metastasis** (you cannot diagnose it on histology alone without metastasis) | Any aggressive-looking pituitary mass, especially with documented distant spread |
| ***Germ cell tumours*** | Suprasellar/pineal location; **more common in children and young adults**; secrete β-hCG and/or AFP | Young patient + sellar/suprasellar mass + tumour markers positive |
| ***Chordoma*** | Arises from **notochordal remnants** at the **clivus** (posterior to sella); locally destructive midline tumour | Destructive clival mass eroding into sella; "physaliphorous" cells on histology |
| ***CNS lymphoma*** | ***Associated with EBV, immunosuppression*** [3]; homogeneously enhancing periventricular/sellar mass | Immunocompromised patient (HIV, transplant) with sellar involvement |

##### b. Secondary (Metastatic) Tumours

***Secondary tumours are 6–10× more common than primary brain tumours*** [3].

- ***CA lung in males*** and ***CA breast in females*** are the most common primaries that metastasise to the pituitary [2].
- Metastases to the pituitary are uncommon overall but should be considered in any patient with known malignancy presenting with new sellar symptoms.
- Tend to involve the **posterior pituitary and stalk** (because the posterior pituitary has a direct arterial blood supply, unlike the anterior pituitary which depends on portal venous blood) → **diabetes insipidus** is an early and prominent feature (unlike adenomas where DI is rare pre-operatively).
- ***Metastatic sources*** in decreasing frequency: ***Lung (37–49%), Breast (16–19%), Melanoma (16%), Colorectum (9%), Kidney (8%)*** [3].

<Callout title="DI as a Red Flag for Metastasis">
If a patient presents with a sellar mass AND diabetes insipidus as the **initial presenting feature** (i.e., pre-operatively), think metastatic disease or infiltrative process rather than typical pituitary adenoma. Adenomas very rarely cause DI before surgery because the posterior pituitary has a separate blood supply and is anatomically distinct.
</Callout>

#### 5. Cysts

| Cyst | Origin | Features | Clinical Significance |
|:-----|:-------|:---------|:---------------------|
| ***Rathke's cyst*** | Remnant of **Rathke's pouch** (same embryological origin as craniopharyngioma) | Intrasellar, well-defined, thin-walled; signal varies on MRI depending on mucoid content; usually **does not enhance** (unlike adenoma) | Usually **incidental and asymptomatic**; rarely causes mass effect or hypopituitarism. Can become infected ("Rathke's abscess"). |
| ***Arachnoid cyst*** | Congenital duplication of arachnoid membrane | CSF-signal on all MRI sequences; does not enhance | Rarely symptomatic in sellar location |
| ***Dermoid / Epidermoid cyst*** | Ectoderm inclusion during neural tube closure | Dermoid: fat signal (bright on T1); Epidermoid: restricted diffusion on DWI | Very rare in sellar region |

**Key differentiator**: Cysts are **non-enhancing** on gadolinium MRI, whereas adenomas and most other tumours enhance (though less than normal pituitary). ***If a sellar lesion can be seen as separate from the normal pituitary gland, this indicates the mass is NOT a pituitary adenoma*** [2] — Rathke's cysts are typically separate.

#### 6. Inflammatory / Infectious Lesions

##### a. Lymphocytic Hypophysitis

- **Auto-immune inflammation** of the pituitary gland — lymphocytic infiltration and destruction.
- Classically affects **women in late pregnancy or postpartum** (sometimes associated with other autoimmune conditions or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer).
- Mimics a pituitary adenoma on MRI: diffuse gland enlargement with homogeneous enhancement; may show thickened stalk.
- Presents with **headache, hypopituitarism, and often early DI** (involvement of stalk/posterior pituitary).
- **Key distinguishing features from adenoma**: postpartum context, early DI (unusual for adenoma), and sometimes a thickened/enhancing stalk on MRI. May respond to corticosteroid therapy.

##### b. Pituitary Abscess

- **Rare**, but life-threatening if missed.
- Can arise **de novo** or secondarily within a pre-existing adenoma or Rathke's cyst.
- Presents with **fever, headache, meningism, and rapid-onset hypopituitarism** — tempo is much faster than a typical adenoma.
- MRI: ring-enhancing sellar mass (similar to brain abscess elsewhere).
- Requires **surgical drainage + antibiotics**.

##### c. Granulomatous / Infiltrative Diseases

- **Sarcoidosis**, **Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)**, **tuberculosis**, **IgG4-related disease** — all can involve the pituitary/stalk.
- Often cause **stalk thickening** + **DI** (stalk/posterior pituitary preference).
- Systemic features (lung disease in sarcoidosis/TB, bone lesions in LCH) provide clues.

#### 7. Vascular Lesions

##### a. Internal Carotid Artery Aneurysm

***Cerebral aneurysm mimicking a sellar tumour!*** [1]

- A **cavernous or supraclinoid ICA aneurysm** can project medially into the sella and mimic a pituitary adenoma on imaging.
- **Why this matters**: If you biopsy or attempt transsphenoidal surgery on what you think is an adenoma but is actually an aneurysm, you get **catastrophic, potentially fatal haemorrhage**.
- **MRI clue**: "flow void" (dark signal within the lesion on T2-weighted sequences due to flowing blood), and on MRA/CTA the aneurysm is clearly vascular.
- **Rule**: Always look at the vascular flow patterns on MRI before planning surgery on any sellar mass.

##### b. Carotid-Cavernous Fistula

***Carotid arteriovenous fistula*** [2] — abnormal communication between the ICA and the cavernous sinus. Can cause pulsatile exophthalmos, chemosis, CN palsies, and a bruit. The venous engorgement can expand the cavernous sinus and mimic a sellar mass.

#### 8. Other Important Mimics

##### a. Empty Sella Syndrome
- The sella appears "empty" on imaging because the arachnoid herniates through a deficient diaphragma sellae, filling the sella with CSF and flattening the pituitary against the sellar floor.
- **Primary empty sella**: Idiopathic; associated with obesity, hypertension, middle-aged women. Usually benign — pituitary function is often normal.
- **Secondary empty sella**: Follows surgery, radiation, apoplexy, or involution of an adenoma.
- Enters the differential when MRI shows a "sellar abnormality" but there is no true mass.

##### b. Hypothalamic Hamartoma
- Ectopic focus of hypothalamic tissue; located in the tuber cinereum.
- Can cause ***gelastic seizures*** (laughing seizures) [1] and **precocious puberty** (ectopic GnRH secretion).
- Distinguished by its characteristic location at the tuber cinereum and non-enhancing isointense signal on MRI.

### Approach to Differentiating Based on Clinical Presentation

The differential can also be framed by how the patient **presents**, which is often the exam stem:

#### Presentation 1: Visual Field Defect + Sellar Mass

| Diagnosis | Key Distinguishing Features |
|:----------|:---------------------------|
| **Pituitary macroadenoma** | Intrasellar origin; hormonal abnormality (excess or deficiency); prolactin < 200 suggests non-functioning with stalk effect |
| **Craniopharyngioma** | Calcification on CT; cystic; suprasellar; bimodal age |
| **Tuberculum sellae meningioma** | Dural-based; dural tail; intense homogeneous enhancement |
| **ICA aneurysm** | Flow void on MRI; pulsatile; MRA/CTA confirms |

#### Presentation 2: Hyperprolactinaemia + Sellar Mass

This is a critical differential because the management is completely different:

| Diagnosis | Prolactin Level | Mass Size | Mechanism |
|:----------|:---------------|:----------|:----------|
| **Microprolactinoma** | 50–200 ng/mL | < 1 cm | Autonomous PRL secretion |
| **Macroprolactinoma** | > 200 ng/mL (often > 1,000) | > 1 cm | Autonomous PRL secretion proportional to tumour mass |
| **Stalk effect** (non-functioning adenoma, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, etc.) | 30–150 ng/mL (usually < 100) | Any size | Loss of dopamine inhibition from stalk compression |
| **Drug-induced** | Usually < 100 ng/mL | Normal pituitary on MRI | Dopamine receptor blockade (antipsychotics, metoclopramide, domperidone) |
| **Other causes** | Variable | Normal pituitary | Hypothyroidism (↓ PRL clearance), CKD (↓ PRL clearance), pregnancy, stress |

> ***Causes of hyperprolactinaemia producing galactorrhoea*** include [5]: ***prolactinoma, craniopharyngioma/metastatic cancer, infiltrative disease (sarcoidosis), head trauma/surgery, drug-induced (antipsychotics — haloperidol/risperidone; antidepressants — amitriptyline/clomipramine; antiemetics — metoclopramide/domperidone), stress, hypothyroidism (↓ clearance), CKD (↓ clearance)***.

<Callout title="The Hook Effect — A Trap for the Unwary" type="error">
In very large macroprolactinomas (prolactin > 10,000 ng/mL), standard immunoassays can paradoxically report a **falsely low/normal** prolactin level due to **antibody saturation** ("hook effect"). The clinician sees a giant sellar mass with a "normal" prolactin and concludes it is non-functioning → proceeds to surgery instead of giving cabergoline. **Solution**: Request serial **dilutions** of the serum sample. If the diluted sample yields a much higher prolactin, you've caught the hook effect. This is why any large sellar mass should have a diluted prolactin measured.
</Callout>

#### Presentation 3: Diabetes Insipidus + Sellar Mass

DI as an **early/presenting feature** is a red flag that the mass is **not a typical pituitary adenoma**:

| Diagnosis | Why DI Occurs |
|:----------|:-------------|
| **Pituitary metastasis** | Metastases preferentially involve the posterior pituitary/stalk (direct arterial supply → haematogenous seeding) |
| **Lymphocytic hypophysitis** | Autoimmune inflammation targets the stalk and posterior pituitary |
| **Granulomatous disease** (sarcoidosis, LCH, TB) | Stalk/hypothalamic infiltration |
| **Craniopharyngioma** | Suprasellar origin with hypothalamic/stalk involvement |
| **Germ cell tumour** | Suprasellar germinomas commonly cause DI in young patients |
| Pituitary adenoma | DI is **rare** pre-operatively (posterior pituitary has separate blood supply and is typically displaced, not destroyed) |

#### Presentation 4: Acute Onset Headache + Visual Loss + Sellar Mass

| Diagnosis | Key Features |
|:----------|:-------------|
| ***Pituitary apoplexy*** | ***Acute haemorrhagic infarction ± SAH; headache, visual loss, coma; acute cortisol insufficiency*** [1] |
| **SAH from ICA aneurysm** | ***Cerebral aneurysm mimicking a sellar tumour*** [1]; thunderclap headache; CTA/MRA shows aneurysm |
| **Bleeding into craniopharyngioma** | Rare; calcified cystic mass |

#### Presentation 5: Child with Sellar/Suprasellar Mass

| Diagnosis | Typical Age | Distinguishing Features |
|:----------|:-----------|:----------------------|
| **Craniopharyngioma** | 5–14 years | ***Failure to thrive*** [1]; calcification; cystic |
| **Germ cell tumour** | Adolescence | ↑ β-hCG, ↑ AFP; pineal or suprasellar |
| **Optic pathway glioma** | < 5 years | Associated with **NF1**; fusiform enlargement of optic nerve/chiasm |
| **Langerhans cell histiocytosis** | Childhood | DI; stalk thickening; bone lesions |
| **Pituitary adenoma** | Uncommon in children | If present, usually prolactinoma or corticotroph |
| **Hypothalamic hamartoma** | Any age (congenital) | ***Gelastic seizures*** [1]; precocious puberty |

### Summary Table: Key Differentiators of Common Sellar Masses

| Feature | Pituitary Adenoma | Craniopharyngioma | Meningioma | Rathke's Cyst | Metastasis | Hypophysitis |
|:--------|:-----------------|:------------------|:-----------|:-------------|:-----------|:-------------|
| Age | Adults (30–60) | Bimodal (5–14, 50–74) | Adults | Any | Known cancer | Postpartum |
| Origin | Within gland | Separate (suprasellar) | Dural-based | Within/above gland | Posterior pit/stalk | Diffuse gland |
| Calcification | Rare | Common | Possible | No | No | No |
| Enhancement | Less than normal pit | Peripheral/rim | Intense, homogeneous | No | Variable | Homogeneous |
| Cystic | Rare | Common | Rare | Yes | No | No |
| DI pre-op | Rare | Common | Rare | Very rare | Common | Common |
| Hormonal | Excess or deficiency | Deficiency | Deficiency | Usually normal | Deficiency (esp. DI) | Deficiency |
| Key imaging clue | Intrasellar origin | Calcification + cyst | Dural tail | Non-enhancing cyst | Posterior pit/stalk | Stalk thickening |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis of Sellar Mass">

1. **Most common sellar mass in adults**: Pituitary adenoma.
2. **Pituitary hyperplasia mimics**: Always check TFTs (thyrotroph hyperplasia from primary hypothyroidism) and pregnancy status (lactotroph hyperplasia) before diagnosing an adenoma.
3. **Craniopharyngioma**: Calcification (CT > MRI), cystic "machine oil," bimodal age, failure to thrive in children.
4. **Meningioma**: Dural tail, intense enhancement, calcification possible, separate from pituitary.
5. **ICA aneurysm**: Flow void on MRI — must exclude before surgery to avoid fatal haemorrhage.
6. **Stalk effect vs prolactinoma**: Stalk compression from any mass → mild PRL elevation (< 100–150 ng/mL); true macroprolactinoma → PRL proportional to size (> 200, often > 1000). Watch for **hook effect** in giant prolactinomas.
7. **DI as presenting feature**: Think metastasis, hypophysitis, granulomatous disease, germ cell tumour, craniopharyngioma — NOT typical adenoma.
8. **Pituitary apoplexy vs ICA aneurysm**: Both can present acutely with headache + visual loss. MRA/CTA is essential.
9. **MRI is the single best imaging procedure; CT is better for calcification (craniopharyngioma, meningioma).**
10. **"If a sellar lesion can be seen as separate from the normal pituitary, it is NOT a pituitary adenoma."**
