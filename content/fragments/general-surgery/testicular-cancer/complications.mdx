## Complications of Testicular Cancer and Its Treatment

Testicular cancer is one of the most curable solid tumours, with ***5-year survival > 95%*** [2]. Paradoxically, this very curability creates a unique set of problems: **the majority of patients are young men who will live for decades after treatment**, which means **long-term treatment-related complications** become critically important — often more so than the cancer itself. Think of it this way: if you cure a 25-year-old man of his testicular cancer, he has 50+ years to develop second cancers, cardiovascular disease, infertility, and metabolic syndrome from the treatments you gave him.

The complications of testicular cancer can be logically divided into:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (from the tumour and its metastases)
2. **Complications of surgery** (orchidectomy, RPLND)
3. **Complications of chemotherapy** (BEP regimen toxicities)
4. **Complications of radiotherapy**
5. **Long-term survivorship complications** (the most important category for exams)
6. **Psychosocial complications**

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

These are complications that arise from the tumour's local effects, metastatic spread, or paraneoplastic phenomena — occurring when the disease is undertreated, diagnosed late, or in advanced stages.

#### 1.1 Local Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|:-------------|:---------|:---------------------|
| Testicular destruction | Tumour replaces normal parenchyma → loss of spermatogenesis and testosterone production from affected testis | Contributes to baseline subfertility (remember ***~50% of men already have some degree of impaired spermatogenesis*** [1]) |
| Intratumoral haemorrhage | Rapidly growing tumour outstrips its blood supply → central necrosis and haemorrhage → sudden capsular distension | Acute testicular pain (~10% of cases), mimicking torsion or epididymitis; can delay correct diagnosis |
| Secondary hydrocele | Tumour irritates the visceral tunica vaginalis → serous exudation into the tunica vaginalis cavity | Obscures the underlying tumour on physical examination; every adult hydrocele requires USS |

#### 1.2 Complications from Metastatic Disease

***Non-seminoma is more likely to spread to retroperitoneal LNs and to distant areas such as the liver, lung, bone and brain via the bloodstream*** [1].

| Metastatic Site | Complication | Mechanism |
|:---------------|:-------------|:---------|
| **Retroperitoneal lymph nodes** | ***Lumbar back pain*** [1] | Bulky para-aortic lymphadenopathy compresses or infiltrates psoas muscle, lumbar nerve roots |
| | Ureteric obstruction → hydronephrosis → renal impairment | Enlarged nodes encase the ureter at the pelvic brim or retroperitoneum → obstructive uropathy |
| | Lower limb oedema | ***Iliac vein or IVC obstruction or thrombosis*** [1] |
| | ***Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, GI bleeding*** | ***Retroduodenal metastasis*** [1] — bulky retroperitoneal nodes compress/invade the duodenum |
| **Lungs** | ***Cough, dyspnoea, haemoptysis*** [1] | Parenchymal metastases ("cannonball" mets); large-volume disease replaces functional lung parenchyma ± causes pleural effusion [16] |
| | Respiratory failure | Massive pulmonary metastases (especially choriocarcinoma) — can be life-threatening at presentation |
| **Brain** | ***CNS symptoms (headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits)*** [1] | Haematogenous spread — particularly choriocarcinoma, which has tropism for cerebral vasculature; brain metastases may be **haemorrhagic** (trophoblastic tissue is inherently vascular and friable) |
| **Bone** | ***Bone pain***, pathological fractures | Haematogenous spread with destruction of cortical bone [1] |
| **Liver** | Hepatomegaly, deranged LFTs | Haematogenous spread, especially NSGCT |

#### 1.3 Paraneoplastic / Hormonal Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Tumour Subtype |
|:-------------|:---------|:--------------|
| ***Gynaecomastia*** (5%) [1] | β-hCG has **structural homology with LH** → stimulates Leydig cells → ↑testosterone → peripheral aromatisation to oestradiol → breast glandular proliferation. Also β-hCG can directly stimulate breast tissue. | Choriocarcinoma, mixed GCT with trophoblastic elements, seminoma with syncytiotrophoblasts |
| ***Hyperthyroidism*** [1] | ***hCG and TSH have a common α-subunit and a β-subunit with considerable homology, and thus hCG has a weak thyroid-stimulating effect*** [1]. When β-hCG levels are very high ( > 50,000–100,000 mIU/mL), this TSH-like activity becomes clinically significant → excess thyroid hormone production. | Choriocarcinoma (massive β-hCG production) |
| Precocious puberty (children) | Leydig cell tumour → excess testosterone → premature virilisation | Leydig cell tumour |
| Feminisation (gynaecomastia, loss of libido, ED, infertility) | Leydig/Sertoli cell tumour → excess oestrogen (directly or via aromatisation); or oestrogen suppresses GnRH axis → ↓LH/FSH | Leydig cell tumour, Sertoli cell tumour |

---

### 2. Complications of Surgery

#### 2.1 Radical Inguinal Orchidectomy

***Complications: usually minimal morbidity, most commonly post-operative scrotal haematoma*** [2].

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence | Management |
|:-------------|:---------|:----------|:-----------|
| ***Post-operative scrotal haematoma*** | Bleeding from the spermatic cord stump or scrotal wound vessels | Most common (~5%) | Small: conservative (ice, compression, analgesia). Large/expanding: surgical exploration and evacuation |
| Wound infection | Bacterial contamination of surgical site | Uncommon (< 2%) | Antibiotics; wound care |
| Chronic groin pain / neuralgia | Damage to the ilioinguinal nerve (L1) running through the inguinal canal, or entrapment in scar tissue | ~5–10% | NSAIDs, neuropathic pain agents (gabapentin), nerve block |
| Hypogonadism (biochemical) | Loss of ~50% of testicular tissue → remaining testis may not fully compensate → ↓testosterone | ~10–20% develop compensated or overt hypogonadism over time | Monitor testosterone levels; TRT if symptomatic hypogonadism (fatigue, ↓libido, ↓bone density, erectile dysfunction) |
| Cosmetic / body image | Absent testis → psychological distress, especially in young men | Variable | Offer testicular prosthesis at time of orchidectomy or later |

#### 2.2 Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection (RPLND)

***RPLND requires expertise and has high risk of complications*** [1].

| Complication | Mechanism | Incidence | Prevention / Management |
|:-------------|:---------|:----------|:----------------------|
| ***Retrograde ejaculation*** (most important) | Damage to the sympathetic postganglionic fibres (hypogastric plexus, T12–L3) that control antegrade ejaculation: (1) closure of bladder neck during ejaculation, (2) coordinated contraction of vas deferens/seminal vesicles. If these fibres are disrupted → semen is ejaculated **backward** into the bladder instead of forward through the urethra → anejaculation or "dry orgasm" → effective infertility despite normal sperm production. | Up to ~75% in non-nerve-sparing RPLND; ***< 5% in nerve-sparing RPLND*** | **Nerve-sparing surgical technique** — meticulous identification and preservation of the postganglionic sympathetic fibres. If retrograde ejaculation occurs: sympathomimetics (pseudoephedrine) may restore antegrade ejaculation in some patients; alternatively, sperm can be recovered from post-orgasm urine for assisted reproduction. |
| Chylous ascites / lymphatic leak | Disruption of the cisterna chyli or major retroperitoneal lymphatics during dissection → leakage of lymphatic fluid (chyle) into the peritoneal cavity | ~2–5% | Fat-free / medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) diet; total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in severe cases; usually self-limiting |
| Bowel obstruction (adhesions) | Post-operative adhesion formation in the retroperitoneum | Uncommon | Conservative initially; surgical adhesiolysis if complete obstruction |
| Vascular injury (aorta, IVC, renal vessels) | Proximity of node-bearing tissue to great vessels; particularly challenging in post-chemo RPLND with desmoplastic reaction around vessels | Rare in experienced centres | Expert surgeon at high-volume centre |
| Wound complications | Large incision (midline laparotomy) → hernia, infection, seroma | Variable | Standard surgical wound care |

<Callout title="Why Nerve-Sparing RPLND Matters So Much">
These patients are young men in their 20s–30s. Retrograde ejaculation means functional infertility. Even though they already have sperm banked, the psychological impact of losing ejaculatory function is significant. Nerve-sparing technique has been one of the most important advances in testicular cancer surgery. However, it requires expert training and may not always be possible (e.g., in bulky post-chemotherapy residual disease with desmoplastic reaction encasing the nerves).

### 3. Complications of Chemotherapy (BEP Regimen)

***BEP therapy: Bleomycin + Etoposide + Cisplatin*** [1]. Each drug has specific toxicity profiles that you must know:

#### 3.1 Cisplatin Toxicities

| Toxicity | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Prevention / Management |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| **Nephrotoxicity** (dose-limiting) | Cisplatin accumulates in renal tubular cells (particularly proximal tubule) → generates reactive oxygen species → direct tubular necrosis + renal vasoconstriction | Rising creatinine, ↓eGFR, renal magnesium/potassium/calcium wasting | Aggressive IV hydration (pre- and post-infusion) + saline loading; monitor renal function before each cycle; dose-reduce or switch to carboplatin if significant decline |
| **Ototoxicity** | Cisplatin damages outer hair cells of the cochlea (basal turn first → high-frequency hearing loss earliest) → generates free radicals → apoptosis of hair cells | High-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (initially > 4 kHz, may progress to conversational frequencies); tinnitus | **Irreversible** — baseline audiometry; dose-reduce if significant hearing loss; sodium thiosulfate (under investigation as otoprotectant) |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Cisplatin accumulates in dorsal root ganglia → damages large myelinated sensory fibres | Stocking-glove distribution paraesthesiae and numbness; may persist long after treatment | Dose-reduce or stop if severe; no proven neuroprotective agent |
| **Severe nausea/vomiting** | Stimulates the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema (medulla) via 5-HT3 and NK1 receptors | Acute (within 24h) and delayed (days 2–5) emesis | **Triple antiemetic prophylaxis**: 5-HT3 antagonist (ondansetron) + NK1 antagonist (aprepitant) + dexamethasone. Cisplatin is among the most emetogenic agents known. |
| **Hypomagnesaemia** | Cisplatin damages the ascending loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule → impaired magnesium reabsorption | Muscle cramps, tremor, ↓reflexes, arrhythmias; can cause secondary hypokalaemia and hypocalcaemia (Mg²⁺ is needed for PTH secretion and K⁺ channel function) | IV/oral magnesium supplementation; monitor Mg²⁺ levels |
| **Myelosuppression** | Bone marrow DNA damage → impaired haematopoiesis | Anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia | G-CSF support if needed; blood product transfusion |

#### 3.2 Etoposide Toxicities

| Toxicity | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Prevention / Management |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| **Myelosuppression** (dose-limiting) | Topoisomerase II inhibition in rapidly dividing haematopoietic progenitors → DNA double-strand breaks → apoptosis | Neutropenia (nadir ~day 10–14), thrombocytopenia, anaemia | G-CSF for neutropenic fever; dose-adjust per protocol |
| ***Secondary leukaemia (treatment-related AML/MDS)*** | Etoposide-related leukaemia characteristically involves **t(11q23) / KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements**; topoisomerase II inhibition at specific genomic sites creates chromosomal translocations | Typically manifests 2–5 years after treatment; presents with cytopenias, bone marrow failure | Risk is cumulative dose-dependent; lifetime monitoring; unfortunately, treatment-related AML has poor prognosis [15] |
| Alopecia | Damage to rapidly dividing hair follicle cells | Universal hair loss (scalp, eyebrows, body hair) | Reversible after treatment completion; scalp cooling may reduce severity |
| Mucositis | Damage to rapidly dividing mucosal epithelial cells | Oral ulceration, dysphagia, diarrhoea | Mouth care, analgesia, nutritional support |

#### 3.3 Bleomycin Toxicities

| Toxicity | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Prevention / Management |
|:---------|:---------|:-----------------|:----------------------|
| ***Pulmonary fibrosis*** (dose-limiting and potentially fatal) | Bleomycin is inactivated by the enzyme **bleomycin hydrolase**, which is present in most tissues **except the lungs and skin**. Therefore, bleomycin **accumulates** in the lungs → generates free radicals → oxidative damage → interstitial pneumonitis → progressive fibrosis | Dry cough, progressive dyspnoea, ↓DLCO on PFTs; bilateral basal reticular infiltrates on CXR; may progress to fatal respiratory failure | Cumulative dose limit: < 300–360 IU total; baseline + serial PFTs (DLCO); **stop bleomycin if DLCO drops > 40% from baseline**; avoid high-dose oxygen |
| ***Fatal interaction with high FiO₂ anaesthesia*** | Bleomycin-damaged lung parenchyma generates massive oxidative stress when exposed to high oxygen concentrations → acute ARDS-like picture → fatal | Acute respiratory failure during or after general anaesthesia with high FiO₂ — **can occur even years after last dose** | ***MUST inform anaesthetist of ANY prior bleomycin exposure; FiO₂ should be kept ≤ 0.3 if safely possible; this should be prominently documented in the patient's medical records*** |
| Skin toxicity | Bleomycin hydrolase also deficient in skin → accumulation | Hyperpigmentation (especially over pressure points and joints — "flagellate" linear streaks), Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, alopecia | Cosmetic concern; usually reversible |
| Fever / anaphylactoid reaction | Direct drug effect (not true allergy); release of pyrogens | Febrile reaction during infusion in ~25%; very rarely anaphylactoid | Test dose before first full dose in some protocols; paracetamol pre-medication |
| Minimal myelosuppression | Unlike most chemo agents, bleomycin does **not** significantly suppress bone marrow — this is actually an advantage, as it can be added to myelosuppressive regimens without compounding that toxicity | — | — |

<Callout title="Bleomycin and Anaesthesia — Worth Repeating" type="error">
This point is so critical that it bears repeating from the management section: **ANY patient who has EVER received bleomycin** — even decades ago — must have this clearly documented. High FiO₂ during general anaesthesia can trigger **fatal pulmonary toxicity**. Every anaesthetist who manages this patient for the rest of their life must be informed. This is a classic exam question and a real-life killer.

### 4. Complications of Radiotherapy

***Adjuvant radiotherapy can be given to seminoma in early stages but at the risk of secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies*** [1].

Radiation toxicity is divided into acute (during/shortly after treatment) and late (months to decades after):

#### 4.1 Acute Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| Nausea / vomiting | Radiation to the para-aortic field → the upper gastrointestinal tract (stomach, duodenum) is within the treatment field → mucosal irritation → triggers vomiting via visceral afferents and CTZ | Anti-emetics (5-HT3 antagonists) |
| Diarrhoea | Small bowel within the radiation field → mucosal inflammation → malabsorption and increased motility | Loperamide, low-residue diet |
| Fatigue | Systemic inflammatory response to radiation; cytokine release (TNF-α, IL-6) | Rest, graded exercise |
| Radiation dermatitis | Direct damage to skin epithelium in the radiation field | Moisturising creams, avoid friction |
| Myelosuppression (mild) | Bone marrow within the radiation field (vertebral bodies, pelvis) | Usually mild; monitor CBC |

#### 4.2 Late Complications (The Major Concern)

| Complication | Mechanism | Latency | Significance |
|:-------------|:---------|:--------|:-------------|
| ***Secondary malignancies*** | Radiation-induced DNA damage in normal tissues within/adjacent to the treatment field → somatic mutations → carcinogenesis. Risk increases over decades. | 10–30+ years | ***Risk of secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies*** [1] — the most important long-term concern. Sites include: GI tract (stomach, pancreas, colon), soft tissue (sarcoma), contralateral testis. The cumulative risk of second cancer is ~2× that of the general population, and continues to rise with follow-up time. This is the primary reason adjuvant RT for Stage I seminoma has fallen out of favour. [15] |
| Cardiovascular disease | Mediastinal scatter → accelerated atherosclerosis of coronary arteries, valvular disease; para-aortic RT → renal artery damage | 10–20+ years | Increased risk of MI, ischaemic heart disease |
| Infertility / gonadotoxicity | Scatter radiation to the remaining contralateral testis → damage to spermatogonia (which are exquisitely radiosensitive — even 0.15 Gy can impair spermatogenesis) | Immediate → months | Gonadal shielding is used but cannot eliminate scatter entirely; recovery of spermatogenesis may take 1–3 years |
| Renal damage | If kidneys are partially within the field → radiation nephritis → chronic kidney disease | Months → years | Careful treatment planning with modern conformal techniques to minimise renal dose |
| Peptic ulcer disease | Radiation damage to gastric/duodenal mucosa | Weeks → months | PPI prophylaxis; usually self-limiting |

---

### 5. Long-Term Survivorship Complications

This is arguably the **most important section** for testicular cancer — because the vast majority of patients are cured and survive for decades. The term "cancer survivor" is particularly relevant here.

#### 5.1 Second Malignancies

| Type | Mechanism | Risk | Timing |
|:-----|:---------|:-----|:-------|
| **Contralateral testicular cancer** | Shared genetic/developmental risk factors (testicular dysgenesis syndrome); radiation scatter to contralateral testis | 2–5% lifetime risk | Any time (even decades later) |
| ***Treatment-related AML/MDS*** | Etoposide → t(11q23) rearrangements; alkylating agents (cisplatin) → complex karyotype | ~0.5–1% cumulative | 2–10 years post-treatment (etoposide-related peaks at 2–5 years) [15] |
| ***Solid second cancers (post-RT)*** | ***Secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies*** [1] — GI cancers (stomach, pancreas, colon), soft tissue sarcomas, renal cancers | ~2× general population; risk continues rising with time | 10–30+ years |
| Solid second cancers (post-chemo) | Cisplatin/etoposide-related DNA damage in normal somatic cells | Modestly increased (smaller risk than post-RT) | 10+ years |

#### 5.2 Cardiovascular Disease

| Risk Factor | Mechanism | Magnitude |
|:-----------|:---------|:----------|
| Cisplatin-related endothelial damage | Cisplatin causes chronic endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, and direct vascular injury → accelerated atherosclerosis | ~1.5–2× increased risk of cardiovascular events |
| Radiation-related vascular damage | Intimal proliferation, fibrosis of coronary and great vessel walls | ~2–3× risk (particularly post-mediastinal RT) |
| Metabolic syndrome | Hypogonadism post-orchidectomy → ↑visceral fat, insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia; cisplatin-related renal Mg²⁺ wasting | Increased risk of T2DM, metabolic syndrome |
| Raynaud's phenomenon | Bleomycin-related vasospasm of digital arteries (small-vessel endothelial damage) | ~10–40% of bleomycin-treated patients; may persist long-term |
| Thromboembolic disease | Cisplatin → endothelial activation, ↑platelet aggregation, ↑thrombotic tendency | ↑ risk of DVT, PE, arterial events during and shortly after treatment |

> **Cardiovascular disease is the leading non-cancer cause of death in testicular cancer survivors.** This is why lifestyle counselling (smoking cessation, exercise, healthy diet) and monitoring of cardiovascular risk factors are essential components of survivorship care.

#### 5.3 Infertility and Hypogonadism

| Complication | Mechanism | Timeline | Management |
|:-------------|:---------|:---------|:-----------|
| ***Impaired spermatogenesis at baseline*** | ***Testicular tumours are associated with gonadal dysgenesis and ~50% of men have some degree of underlying impairment of spermatogenesis*** [1] | At diagnosis (pre-treatment) | ***Cryopreservation of sperm*** [1] before any treatment |
| ***Further deterioration after orchidectomy*** | ***Semen quality may further deteriorate following removal of affected testis*** [1] — loss of ~50% of germ cell mass | Post-orchidectomy | Sperm banking pre-op if possible |
| Chemotherapy-related azoospermia | Cisplatin and etoposide are gonadotoxic → damage spermatogonial stem cells → temporary or permanent azoospermia | During and post-chemo | Recovery of spermatogenesis occurs in ~50–80% of patients within 2–5 years after BEP; alkylating agents are more permanently damaging |
| Radiation-related azoospermia | Spermatogonia are among the most radiosensitive cells in the body (even doses as low as 0.15 Gy impair spermatogenesis) | During and post-RT | Gonadal shielding; recovery over 1–3 years possible if dose low |
| Hypogonadism (↓testosterone) | Loss of one testis + potential damage to remaining testis from chemo/RT → compensated (↑LH, normal testosterone) or overt hypogonadism (↓testosterone) | Gradual; may develop years later | Monitor testosterone, LH, FSH annually; TRT if symptomatic |
| Leydig cell damage | Leydig cells are more radioresistant than germ cells but still susceptible to high-dose chemotherapy → ↓testosterone | Post-treatment | TRT if indicated |

#### 5.4 Metabolic Syndrome

Testicular cancer survivors treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy have a significantly increased risk of metabolic syndrome (central obesity + dyslipidaemia + hypertension + insulin resistance):

| Component | Mechanism |
|:----------|:---------|
| Central obesity | Hypogonadism → ↓testosterone → altered body fat distribution (visceral > subcutaneous) |
| Dyslipidaemia | Cisplatin-related endothelial dysfunction; hypogonadism → ↓HDL, ↑LDL, ↑triglycerides |
| Insulin resistance / T2DM | Hypogonadism + obesity → insulin resistance; cisplatin may have direct pancreatic β-cell toxicity |
| Hypertension | Cisplatin-related nephrotoxicity → chronic renal dysfunction → salt-water retention; vascular endothelial damage |

> Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in testicular cancer survivors is approximately **20–30%**, compared to ~10% in age-matched controls. Annual screening and aggressive risk factor management are essential.

#### 5.5 Neurotoxicity (Persistent)

| Type | Mechanism | Incidence | Outcome |
|:-----|:---------|:----------|:--------|
| Peripheral neuropathy | Cisplatin accumulates in dorsal root ganglia → demyelination and axonal degeneration of large sensory fibres | ~20–40% during treatment; ~10–20% have persistent symptoms | Stocking-glove numbness, paraesthesiae; may be permanent |
| Ototoxicity / tinnitus | Cisplatin → outer hair cell destruction in basal turn of cochlea | ~20–40% have some high-frequency hearing loss | Irreversible; some patients require hearing aids |
| Cognitive changes ("chemobrain") | Poorly understood; possibly cisplatin-related microvascular damage to CNS, inflammatory cytokine effects on hippocampus | Subtle; reported by ~15–25% of survivors | Concentration difficulties, memory impairment; usually mild |

#### 5.6 Pulmonary Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Monitoring |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| ***Bleomycin pulmonary fibrosis*** | As detailed above — bleomycin accumulates in lung due to absence of bleomycin hydrolase → free radical damage → irreversible fibrosis | PFTs (DLCO) during treatment; lifetime awareness for anaesthetic risk |
| Restrictive lung disease | Post-fibrosis → reduced lung compliance → ↓FVC, ↓TLC | Annual PFTs if symptomatic |
| Exertional dyspnoea | Even subclinical bleomycin lung damage → reduced exercise tolerance | Cardiopulmonary exercise testing if symptomatic |

#### 5.7 Renal Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Monitoring |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------|
| Chronic kidney disease | Cisplatin → direct proximal tubular necrosis + glomerular damage → ↓GFR (typically mild-moderate decline of 15–30%) | Monitor eGFR/creatinine annually |
| Electrolyte wasting | Cisplatin damages tubular reabsorption mechanisms → persistent magnesium, potassium, calcium wasting | Monitor electrolytes; supplement as needed |
| Hypertension | Renovascular damage → RAAS activation → salt/water retention | Blood pressure monitoring |

---

### 6. Psychosocial Complications

These are often underappreciated but extremely important in the context of young men with cancer:

| Complication | Context | Intervention |
|:-------------|:--------|:-------------|
| Anxiety and depression | Diagnosis of cancer in a young person; fear of recurrence (especially during surveillance); body image concerns (loss of testis) | Psychological support, counselling, referral to psycho-oncology |
| Body image disturbance | Missing testis, surgical scars, gynaecomastia, weight gain, alopecia | Testicular prosthesis; counselling; support groups |
| Sexual dysfunction | Erectile dysfunction (hypogonadism, psychological); retrograde ejaculation (post-RPLND); loss of libido (↓testosterone) | TRT, PDE5 inhibitors; psychosexual counselling |
| Fertility anxiety | Even with sperm banking, patients worry about future fertility; some patients present without prior banking | Early fertility counselling; IVF/ICSI with banked sperm; referral to reproductive medicine |
| Relationship difficulties | Sexual dysfunction, fertility concerns, psychological burden of cancer diagnosis | Couples counselling; open communication encouraged |
| Return-to-work challenges | Treatment duration (3–4 months for BEP × 3–4 cycles); fatigue; concentration difficulties | Occupational therapy; phased return to work |
| Fear of contralateral tumour | 2–5% lifetime risk of second testicular cancer; surveillance generates ongoing anxiety | Testicular self-examination education; reassurance about curability |

---

### 7. Disease Relapse

While not strictly a "complication," relapse is an important adverse outcome:

| Feature | Detail |
|:--------|:-------|
| ***Relapse > 2 years is rare*** [2] | Most relapses occur within first 1–2 years; hence surveillance is most intensive during this period |
| Late relapse ( > 2 years) | Occurs in < 5% of cases; tends to be **chemoresistant** (often mature teratoma with somatic transformation) |
| Salvage success | First salvage chemotherapy (TIP/VeIP) achieves long-term remission in ~50% of relapsed patients; high-dose chemo + autologous SCT for further relapse [15] |
| Growing teratoma syndrome | Enlarging mass during/after chemo with normalising markers → teratoma (chemoresistant) → requires surgical resection |

---

### 8. Summary — Complications Organised by Timeframe

| Timeframe | Key Complications |
|:----------|:-----------------|
| **At diagnosis** | Subfertility (~50% baseline); local symptoms; metastatic complications (back pain, dyspnoea, neurological) |
| **Peri-operative** (orchidectomy) | Scrotal haematoma; wound infection; inguinal neuralgia |
| **During chemotherapy** (weeks–months) | Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, neuropathy, N/V (cisplatin); neutropenia, alopecia (etoposide); pulmonary toxicity (bleomycin); thromboembolic events |
| **Peri-RPLND** | Retrograde ejaculation; chylous ascites; vascular injury; bowel obstruction |
| **During RT** (weeks) | Nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, radiation dermatitis |
| **Early post-treatment** (months–years) | Recovery of spermatogenesis; persistence of neuropathy/ototoxicity; Raynaud's |
| **Late** (5–30+ years) | ***Secondary malignancies*** (AML/MDS at 2–5y; solid second cancers at 10–30y); ***cardiovascular disease***; metabolic syndrome; chronic renal impairment; hypogonadism; pulmonary fibrosis; contralateral testicular cancer |
| **Lifelong** | Psychosocial (anxiety, depression, body image, sexual dysfunction, fertility concerns); anaesthetic risk (bleomycin lung) |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Disease complications**: Intratumoral haemorrhage (mimics torsion), ureteric obstruction (retroperitoneal LNs), haemorrhagic brain mets (choriocarcinoma), hyperthyroidism (very high β-hCG has TSH-like activity), gynaecomastia (β-hCG → oestrogen).

**Orchidectomy**: Usually minimal morbidity. Most common = scrotal haematoma. Long-term: hypogonadism (monitor testosterone).

**RPLND**: Most important = retrograde ejaculation (damage to sympathetic postganglionic fibres T12–L3). Prevented by nerve-sparing technique (reduces rate from 75% to < 5%).

**BEP toxicities**: Cisplatin = nephrotoxicity (hydration), ototoxicity (irreversible), neuropathy, severe N/V. Etoposide = myelosuppression, secondary AML/MDS (t(11q23), peaks 2–5 years). Bleomycin = pulmonary fibrosis (cumulative dose < 300 IU; DLCO monitoring; NEVER high FiO₂ — even years later).

**Radiotherapy**: Secondary malignancies (the main reason RT is falling out of favour for Stage I seminoma); cardiovascular disease; gonadotoxicity.

**Survivorship (most important)**: Cardiovascular disease (leading non-cancer cause of death); metabolic syndrome (20–30%); secondary malignancies; persistent neuropathy/ototoxicity; infertility/hypogonadism; psychosocial distress. Annual screening and risk factor management are essential.

**Bleomycin-anaesthesia rule**: ANY prior bleomycin exposure = lifelong high FiO₂ contraindication during anaesthesia. MUST inform every anaesthetist.

Anatomical basis: sympathetic postganglionic fibres from the hypogastric plexus (originating T12-L3) run along the aorta and cross anterior to common iliac arteries. These control: (1) bladder neck closure during ejaculation, (2) coordinated contraction of vas deferens and seminal vesicles. Damage during RPLND disrupts these functions. Prevention: nerve-sparing RPLND technique (reduces rate from 75% to less than 5%).

      markscheme: "Despite relapse rates of only 1-3% with adjuvant RT (vs 15-20% with surveillance), RT has fallen out of favour because: (1) Risk of secondary radiotherapy-induced malignancies that increases over decades - these young patients live 40-50+ years post-treatment, accumulating significant second-cancer risk (GI cancers, sarcomas, contralateral testicular cancer). (2) Even with surveillance, the 15-20% who relapse are virtually ALL salvaged with chemotherapy, so the overall cure rate is the same (~99-100%). (3) Gonadotoxicity from scatter to the remaining testis. (4) Cardiovascular disease risk from vascular damage. In essence, the late toxicity of RT outweighs its marginal benefit when surveillance achieves the same cure rate."
