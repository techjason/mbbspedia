## Differential Diagnosis of a Testicular Mass / Testicular Cancer

The differential diagnosis of testicular cancer is essentially the differential of a **scrotal mass** or **scrotal swelling**. The clinical approach is systematic — you use a handful of bedside examination steps to narrow down the possibilities. Let's build this from first principles.

### The Core Logic: Why a Systematic Approach Matters

A young man walks in with a scrotal swelling. The critical question is: **"Is this a testicular tumour?"** — because missing this diagnosis delays potentially curative treatment. Everything else in the differential is either benign (hydrocele, epididymal cyst) or urgent-but-different (testicular torsion). The examination algorithm is designed to rapidly narrow the field.

---

### 1. The Examination-Based Differential Diagnosis Algorithm

The classic approach to any scrotal mass uses **four sequential clinical questions** [1][6]:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A["Scrotal Swelling"] --> B{"1. Can you get ABOVE the swelling?"}
    B -->|"NO"| C["Inguinoscrotal swelling (mass extends from abdomen)"]
    C --> C1["Indirect inguinal hernia (cough impulse, reducible, testis palpable, opaque)"]
    C --> C2["Communicating hydrocele (no cough impulse, irreducible, testis not palpable, transilluminable)"]
    B -->|"YES"| D{"2. Is the mass SEPARABLE from the testis?"}
    D -->|"YES"| E["Epididymal / paratesticular / vascular origin"]
    E --> E1["Epididymal cyst / spermatocele (transilluminable, non-tender)"]
    E --> E2["Chronic epididymitis / TB epididymis (opaque, firm)"]
    E --> E3["Varicocele ('bag of worms', decompresses supine)"]
    E --> E4["Sebaceous cyst of scrotum"]
    D -->|"NO"| F{"3. Does it TRANSILLUMINATE?"}
    F -->|"YES"| G["Fluid-filled / cystic"]
    G --> G1["Non-communicating hydrocele (soft, uniformly enlarged)"]
    F -->|"NO"| H{"4. Is it TENDER?"}
    H -->|"YES"| I["Painful testicular swelling"]
    I --> I1["Testicular torsion (surgical emergency)"]
    I --> I2["Torsion of appendix testis / appendix epididymis"]
    I --> I3["Epididymo-orchitis"]
    I --> I4["Acute haematocele (trauma)"]
    H -->|"NO"| J["Painless, solid, testicular mass"]
    J --> J1["TESTICULAR TUMOUR (until proven otherwise)"]
    J --> J2["Chronic haematocele"]
    J --> J3["Syphilitic gumma (rare)"]
    J --> J4["Leukaemic infiltrate"]
```

> **The testicular cancer box**: Can get above, inseparable from testis, opaque (does not transilluminate), non-tender, firm/hard. This is the classic profile [1][6][9].

### 2. Complete Differential Diagnosis Table

This is the **master table** for scrotal swelling, organized by examination findings [1][6][10]:

| Can Get Above? | Separable from Testis? | Transillumination | Tenderness | Differential Diagnosis |
|:---------------|:----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------|:----------------------|
| **Cannot** get above | Testis palpable | Opaque | Tender / Non-tender | ***Indirect inguinal hernia*** (cough impulse +, reducible) |
| **Cannot** get above | Testis not palpable | Transilluminable | Non-tender | ***Communicating hydrocele*** (patent processus vaginalis) |
| **Can** get above | NOT separable from epididymis | Opaque | **Tender** | ***Testicular torsion***, ***Torsion of appendix testis/epididymis***, ***Epididymo-orchitis***, Acute haematocele |
| **Can** get above | NOT separable from epididymis | Opaque | **Non-tender** | ***Testicular tumour***, Chronic haematocele, Syphilitic gumma, ***Leukaemic infiltrate*** |

| **Can** get above | Separable from epididymis | Transilluminable | Non-tender | ***Cyst of epididymis (spermatocele)*** |

[1][6]

### 3. Differential Diagnosis Discussed in Detail — By Category

#### 3.1 Painful Scrotal Swelling (Acute Scrotum)

These are the conditions that may **mimic** testicular cancer when it presents with pain (~10–20% of testicular cancers present with pain due to intratumoral haemorrhage or infarction) [1].

##### A. ***Testicular Torsion*** [10][11]

- **What it is**: Twisting of the spermatic cord → occlusion of testicular blood supply → ischaemia → infarction if not corrected within ~6 hours
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Both present as acute scrotal swelling in young men. However, torsion is **exquisitely painful** with sudden onset, whereas testicular cancer pain is usually dull/aching.
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - ***Sudden persistent agonizing scrotal pain*** with radiation to groin/lower abdomen [10]
  - ***High-riding testis with horizontal lie*** (the torted testis is pulled superiorly by the shortened, twisted cord) [10]
  - ***Absent cremasteric reflex*** — normally, stroking the inner thigh causes ipsilateral testicular elevation; in torsion, the cord is twisted and the cremaster cannot function [10]
  - ***Negative Prehn's sign*** — elevation of the scrotum does NOT relieve pain (cf. epididymo-orchitis where it may relieve pain by reducing venous congestion) [10]
  - N/V common (vagal response to severe pain)
- **Age**: Two peaks — neonatal and ***12–18 years (65%)*** [10][11]
- **Risk factors**: ***Bell-clapper deformity*** (tunica vaginalis attaches too high on spermatic cord → testis hangs like a "clapper in a bell" and can rotate freely) [10][11], ***cryptorchidism*** [11]
- **Why it matters**: This is a **surgical emergency** — irreversible damage after ~6–12 hours of ischaemia. Must be excluded before considering testicular cancer [10]

##### B. ***Torsion of the Appendix Testis or Appendix Epididymis*** [1][11][12]

- **What it is**: The appendix testis (a vestigial Müllerian duct remnant at the superior pole) or appendix epididymis (a Wolffian duct remnant) twists on its pedicle → ischaemia and pain
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Presents with acute scrotal pain in young boys, mimicking torsion or tumour
- **Key distinguishing feature**: ***"Blue dot sign"*** — a small, tender, bluish nodule visible through the scrotal skin at the superior pole of the testis (the infarcted appendix)
- **Age**: Most common in prepubertal boys (7–14 years)
- **Management**: Self-limiting — NSAIDs and rest (unlike testicular torsion which needs surgery)

##### C. ***Epididymo-orchitis*** [1][6][12]

- **What it is**: Infection/inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) ± testis (orchitis)
- **Why it's critically important in the DDx**: This is the **most common misdiagnosis** of testicular cancer. Up to 25% of testicular cancers are initially treated as epididymitis with antibiotics before the correct diagnosis is made.
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - Gradual onset of pain (over days), unlike the sudden onset of torsion
  - Fever, dysuria, urethral discharge (infective aetiology)
  - Epididymis is enlarged and tender **separately** from the testis (early); later, inflammation extends to involve the testis (epididymo-orchitis) and the two become inseparable
  - ***Positive Prehn's sign*** — elevation of scrotum relieves pain (reduces venous congestion)
  - ***Positive cremasteric reflex*** (unlike torsion)
- **Aetiology by age**:
  - < 35 years: STIs — *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*
  - > 35 years: UTI pathogens — *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*
  - Mumps orchitis: postpubertal, occurs ~5 days after parotitis, ***exquisitely tender and indurated*** [6]

<Callout title="The 2-Week Rule" type="error">
If a young man is treated for "epididymitis" and the swelling does **NOT resolve within 2 weeks** of appropriate antibiotics, an **urgent scrotal ultrasound** is mandatory to exclude testicular cancer. This is one of the most commonly missed diagnoses in urology.
</Callout>

##### D. Acute Haematocele [1]

- **What it is**: Blood collection within the tunica vaginalis, usually from trauma
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Produces a tender, opaque scrotal mass inseparable from the testis — exactly like a tumour
- **Key distinguishing feature**: Clear history of trauma, acute onset
- **Caveat**: A tumour can present **after** minor trauma — the trauma draws the patient's attention to a pre-existing mass. Always consider ultrasound.

##### E. ***Incarcerated Inguinal Hernia*** [1][11]

- **What it is**: Bowel/omentum trapped in the inguinal canal → scrotal extension → cannot be reduced
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Produces a painful inguinoscrotal swelling
- **Key distinguishing feature**: **Cannot get above** the swelling (extends from abdomen through inguinal canal), cough impulse present, bowel sounds may be heard
- **Not truly a testicular mass** — but must be considered in the acute scrotum

##### F. Other Rare Causes of Acute Scrotum [11][12]

| Condition | Key Feature | Why It Mimics |
|:----------|:-----------|:-------------|
| ***Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (HSP)*** | Purpuric rash on lower limbs/buttocks, arthralgia, abdominal pain, haematuria; scrotal involvement in ~15% of boys | IgA vasculitis causes scrotal oedema and pain |
| ***Fournier's Gangrene*** | Necrotizing fasciitis of perineum; toxic, crepitus, rapidly spreading cellulitis | Rare but life-threatening; usually in diabetics/immunocompromised |
| Trauma | Clear history | Direct injury to testis |
| ***Orchitis (e.g. mumps)*** | ***Exquisitely tender, indurated; occurs 5 days after parotitis in postpubertal patients*** [6] | Viral orchitis without epididymitis |

---

#### 3.2 Painless Scrotal Swelling (The Key Differential for Testicular Cancer)

This is the differential that matters most, because testicular cancer typically presents as a **painless** mass.

##### A. ***Hydrocele*** [1][6][13]

- **What it is**: ***Collection of peritoneal fluid between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis*** [13]
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Produces a **painless, uniformly enlarged** scrotal swelling that may obscure the underlying testis
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - ***Transilluminable*** — light passes through the fluid-filled sac (unlike solid tumour which is opaque)
  - Uniformly enlarged, smooth surface
  - Testis **not well-defined** within the hydrocele
  - Can get above the swelling (unless communicating type)
- **Critical point**: A ***secondary (reactive) hydrocele*** can form around a testicular tumour (~10–15% of cases) — the tumour irritates the visceral tunica vaginalis and causes serous exudation [13]. Therefore, **every hydrocele in an adult should have an ultrasound** to exclude an underlying testicular tumour.
- **Types** [13]:
  - Communicating: patent processus vaginalis (congenital); changes size with Valsalva/cough
  - Non-communicating: primary (idiopathic) or secondary (reactive)

##### B. ***Epididymal Cyst / Spermatocele*** [1][6]

- **What it is**: Cystic fluid collection within the epididymis (spermatocele contains spermatozoa in milky fluid)
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Painless scrotal swelling
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - ***Separable from the testis*** — you can feel normal testis below/anterior to the cyst
  - ***Transilluminable***
  - Located **posterosuperior** to the testis (where the epididymis sits)
  - Usually small, well-defined

##### C. ***Varicocele*** [1][6][14]

- **What it is**: ***Collection of dilated and tortuous veins caused by dilatation of the pampiniform plexus*** [14]
- **Why it's in the DDx**: Painless scrotal swelling, especially on the left
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - ***"Bag of worms" texture on palpation*** [6][11][14]
  - ***Decompresses in the supine position*** (venous blood drains with gravity)
  - ***More prominent with Valsalva manoeuvre*** (increases venous pressure)
  - ***85–95% left-sided*** [14] — because the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein at a 90° angle (vs. right drains directly into IVC at an oblique angle), and the left renal vein is compressed between the aorta and SMA (***"nutcracker effect"***) [14]
  - ***Sometimes related to left renal tumour or left renal vein thrombosis*** [6] — a **new, non-decompressing varicocele** in an older man (especially right-sided) should prompt investigation for retroperitoneal pathology (renal cell carcinoma with IVC thrombus) [14]

##### D. ***Testicular Lymphoma*** [2]

- **What it is**: ***Aggressive extranodal NHL (usually DLBCL), commonly bilateral, with propensity for extranodal spread to skin, subcutaneous tissue, CNS, lungs*** [2]
- **Why it's critically important**: ***Most common cause of testicular mass in males > 60 years*** [2]
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - Older age group ( > 60)
  - ***Commonly bilateral*** (unlike GCTs which are almost always unilateral)
  - Firm, painless testicular enlargement
  - B-symptoms may be present (fever, night sweats, weight loss)
  - AFP and β-hCG are **normal** (these are not germ cell-derived)
  - Diagnosis requires orchidectomy and histopathology; treated as systemic lymphoma

##### E. ***Leukaemic Infiltrate*** [2][4][6]

- **What it is**: Infiltration of testicular parenchyma by leukaemic cells, most commonly in ALL
- ***Testis involved in 5% of ALL*** [2]; ***painless testicular enlargement*** [4]
- **Why the testis is a "sanctuary site"**: The blood-testis barrier (tight junctions between Sertoli cells) limits penetration of systemically administered chemotherapy drugs → leukaemic cells can survive and cause relapse
- **Key distinguishing features**:
  - ***Enlarged, hard testis*** [6]
  - Known history of leukaemia (usually childhood ALL)
  - Can be bilateral
  - Diagnosis by biopsy or orchidectomy

##### F. Chronic Haematocele [1]

- Old blood collection within the tunica vaginalis (from prior trauma or torsion)
- Opaque (does not transilluminate), non-tender
- May calcify over time → hard and opaque (mimics tumour)
- History of prior trauma/event

##### G. ***Syphilitic Gumma*** [6]

- A granulomatous lesion of tertiary syphilis affecting the testis
- Firm, painless testicular mass — clinically indistinguishable from tumour
- Extremely rare today
- Treponemal serology positive

##### H. ***Sebaceous Cyst of Scrotum*** [6]

- Arises from scrotal skin, NOT from the testis itself
- Mobile, superficial, punctum may be visible
- Not truly in the differential of a testicular mass, but included in the scrotal swelling DDx

---

#### 3.3 Bilateral Scrotal Swelling

When both sides are swollen, think differently:

| Condition | Mechanism |
|:----------|:---------|
| Scrotal oedema | Generalised oedema (nephrotic syndrome, heart failure, liver failure) → fluid accumulates in dependent scrotal tissue [6] |
| Bilateral hydrocele | Can occur in fluid overload states |
| Bilateral testicular lymphoma | ***Commonly bilateral*** [2] — the most important bilateral testicular mass in an elderly man |
| Bilateral leukaemic infiltrate | Sanctuary site relapse in ALL |
| Bilateral varicocele | Less common; 33% of varicoceles are bilateral [14] |

---

### 4. Differential Diagnosis by Age Group

This is a high-yield way to organise the DDx because the likely diagnosis changes dramatically with age:

| Age Group | Most Likely Testicular Mass | Other Considerations |
|:----------|:---------------------------|:--------------------|
| **Neonates** | Hydrocele (communicating), testicular torsion (extravaginal) | Inguinal hernia |
| **Children (< 12 years)** | Yolk sac tumour (most common paediatric testicular malignancy), torsion of appendix testis, testicular torsion | Teratoma (benign in children), rhabdomyosarcoma (paratesticular) |
| **Adolescents (12–18)** | Testicular torsion (peak age), GCTs (especially teratoma/mixed) | Epididymo-orchitis (STIs) |
| **Young adults (18–40)** | ***Testicular GCT*** (seminoma or NSGCT) — the classic age group | Epididymo-orchitis, varicocele, hydrocele |
| **Middle-aged (40–60)** | Seminoma (peak ~40), spermatocele, hydrocele | Secondary varicocele (investigate for renal tumour) |
| **Elderly ( > 60)** | ***Testicular lymphoma*** (most common testicular mass at this age) [2] | Hydrocele, epididymal tumour, metastasis from other primary |

---

### 5. Differential Diagnosis by Tumour Marker Profile

When serum markers are available, they help narrow the differential among testicular malignancies:

| AFP | β-hCG | LDH | Most Likely Diagnosis |
|:----|:------|:----|:---------------------|
| **Normal** | **Normal** | Normal | Pure teratoma, sex cord-stromal tumour, lymphoma, benign conditions |
| **Normal** | **Mildly ↑** | ±↑ | Seminoma (10–15% produce low-level β-hCG) |
| **↑** | ±↑ | ±↑ | NSGCT (yolk sac tumour, embryonal carcinoma, mixed GCT) |
| Normal | **↑↑↑** | ±↑ | Choriocarcinoma |
| **↑↑↑** | Normal | ±↑ | Yolk sac tumour |
| **↑** | Any value | Any | ***NSGCT regardless of histology*** — AFP is NEVER elevated in pure seminoma [1][9] |

<Callout title="The Golden Rule of AFP" type="error">
If the pathologist reports "pure seminoma" but AFP is elevated → it is **NSGCT** until proven otherwise. The elevated AFP means there is a non-seminomatous component (likely yolk sac) that the pathologist missed on sampling. This changes management completely. ***AFP is NEVER elevated in pure seminoma*** [1].
</Callout>

### 6. Distinguishing Testicular Cancer from Its Closest Mimics — Summary Comparison

| Feature | Testicular Cancer | Epididymo-orchitis | Testicular Torsion | Hydrocele |
|:--------|:-----------------|:------------------|:------------------|:---------|
| **Age** | 15–35 (GCT), > 60 (lymphoma) | Any age | 12–18 (peak) | Any age |
| **Onset** | Gradual (weeks–months) | Gradual (days) | Sudden (minutes–hours) | Gradual (months–years) |
| **Pain** | Usually painless (~80%) | Painful | ***Agonizing*** | Painless |
| **Tenderness** | Non-tender | Tender | Exquisitely tender | Non-tender |
| **Transillumination** | Opaque | Opaque | Opaque | ***Transilluminable*** |
| **Separable from testis** | No | Early: yes; Late: no | No | No (testis obscured) |
| **Cremasteric reflex** | Present | Present | ***Absent*** | Present |
| **Prehn's sign** | N/A | Positive (relief with elevation) | ***Negative*** | N/A |
| **Fever / dysuria** | No | Yes | ± mild | No |
| **Scrotal skin** | Normal (unless pT4) | Erythematous, warm | Erythematous, oedematous | Normal |
| **Ultrasound** | Solid intratesticular mass | Enlarged, hyperaemic epididymis ± testis | Whirlpool sign, absent blood flow | Anechoic fluid collection |
| **Tumour markers** | ± ↑AFP, β-hCG, LDH | Normal | Normal | Normal |

---

### 7. Non-Testicular Conditions That May Present with Apparent Testicular Mass

Sometimes patients are referred with a "testicular lump" that turns out to be something else entirely:

| Condition | Why It May Be Confused | How to Distinguish |
|:----------|:----------------------|:------------------|
| Inguinal hernia extending into scrotum | Large scrotal swelling | **Cannot get above** the swelling; cough impulse; bowel sounds; reducible |
| Scrotal wall pathology (sebaceous cyst, lipoma) | Palpable lump in scrotal area | Separate from testis; moves with skin; superficial |
| Referred pain from renal colic | Pain radiating to testis/scrotum | Testis is normal on examination; ureteric stone on CT-KUB |
| Idiopathic scrotal oedema | Bilateral scrotal swelling | No discrete mass; pitting oedema; investigate for systemic cause |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Approach to scrotal mass**: (1) Can you get above it? → (2) Separable from testis? → (3) Transilluminates? → (4) Tender?

**Testicular cancer profile**: Can get above, inseparable from testis, opaque, non-tender, firm/hard.

**Top mimics**: Epididymo-orchitis (most common misdiagnosis — apply 2-week rule), testicular torsion (surgical emergency — absent cremasteric reflex, high-riding testis), hydrocele (transilluminable — but always USS to exclude underlying tumour).

**By age**: Children → yolk sac tumour, torsion; Young adults → GCT; Elderly → lymphoma (bilateral!).

**Reactive hydrocele**: 10–15% of testicular cancers have a secondary hydrocele — every adult hydrocele needs ultrasound.

**AFP rule**: If AFP elevated → NSGCT regardless of histology.

**Varicocele red flag**: New non-decompressing varicocele (especially right-sided) → investigate for retroperitoneal/renal pathology.

**Leukaemic infiltrate**: Testis is a "sanctuary site" in ALL due to the blood-testis barrier.

      markscheme: "Diagnosis: testicular torsion. Underlying abnormality: Bell-clapper deformity (tunica vaginalis attaches high on the spermatic cord instead of anchoring the testis, allowing it to rotate freely like a clapper in a bell).

A new right-sided varicocele, especially one that does not decompress supine, suggests obstruction of the IVC or right testicular vein by an extrinsic mass. Must investigate for retroperitoneal pathology: renal cell carcinoma with IVC thrombus, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, or other retroperitoneal tumour. Similarly, a left-sided non-decompressing varicocele may indicate left renal vein obstruction (e.g., left RCC)."
