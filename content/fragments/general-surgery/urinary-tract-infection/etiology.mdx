# Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

## 1. Definition

***Urinary tract infection (UTI): inflammatory response of the urothelium to invasion by bacteria or other pathogens, usually associated with bacteriuria and pyuria.*** [1]

Let's break down what this means from first principles:

- **Urothelium** = the specialised transitional epithelium lining the urinary tract from the renal pelvis down to the urethra. When bacteria invade this epithelium, the host mounts an **inflammatory response** — that is the UTI.
- The definition deliberately says "usually associated with" bacteriuria and pyuria because these terms are **not synonymous** with UTI:

| Term | Definition | Equals UTI? | Other Causes |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| ***Bacteriuria*** | ***Presence of bacteria in urine*** | ***No — does NOT equate infection*** | ***Colonisation, contamination of urine sample*** [1][2] |
| ***Pyuria*** | ***Presence of WBCs in urine*** | ***No — indicative of infective or inflammatory response but does NOT equate infection*** | ***Stones, cancer, TB, interstitial nephritis*** [1][2] |

> **UTI = significant bacteriuria + pyuria + clinical symptoms/signs** [3]. You need all three to clinch the diagnosis. A positive culture alone (bacteriuria) without symptoms may just be asymptomatic bacteriuria — a completely different entity that usually does NOT require treatment (with specific exceptions we will cover later).

<Callout title="Common Exam Pitfall" type="error">
Students frequently equate a positive urine culture with UTI. Remember: bacteriuria ≠ UTI. You must have clinical evidence of infection (symptoms/signs + pyuria) alongside significant bacteriuria to diagnose UTI. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria unnecessarily drives antimicrobial resistance.

## 2. Epidemiology

***UTI is one of the commonest bacterial infections, accounting for 1–3% of GP consultations.*** [4]

### 2.1 Overall Burden

- ***30% of females have symptomatic UTI by age 24*** [4]
- ***50% of females will have at least one UTI during their lifetime*** [4]
- UTI is the **most common nosocomial infection** worldwide, largely driven by catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI)
- In Hong Kong, UTI is a leading cause of bacteraemia in elderly patients, particularly in residential care homes

### 2.2 Age and Sex Distribution

***Demographics: F >>> M (rare in M except at extremes of age: 0–1 year or > 60 years with BPH). Bacteriuria is 30× more common in young females than males. Incidence increases with age, with a sharp increase after onset of sexual activity.*** [4]

| Age Group | Sex Predilection | Explanation |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Neonates (< 1 year) | **M > F** | ***Uncircumcised boys have a 10-fold higher risk of UTI in the first year due to bacterial colonisation of the glans and foreskin*** [1]. Also higher rates of congenital urological anomalies (e.g. posterior urethral valves) in males |
| ***Neonates and infants*** | Both | ***Increased bacterial colonisation of the periurethral area and an immature immune system, especially in the first few weeks*** [1] |
| Children (1–5 years) | F > M | ***Girls – 5%, Boys – 1%*** [1]. Female urethra is shorter (~4 cm vs ~20 cm in adult males), facilitating ascending infection |
| Reproductive age | F >>> M | Short female urethra, proximity to anus, sexual intercourse ("honeymoon cystitis"), hormonal effects on vaginal flora |
| Post-menopausal | F >> M | Oestrogen deficiency → loss of protective vaginal lactobacilli → ↑vaginal pH → ↑periurethral colonisation |
| Elderly (> 60 years) | Gap narrows | Males: BPH → incomplete bladder emptying → stasis. Both sexes: ↑comorbidities (DM, catheterisation, institutionalisation) |

### 2.3 Hong Kong–Specific Epidemiological Considerations

- **Ageing population**: Hong Kong has one of the highest proportions of elderly globally → high burden of complicated UTI, CAUTI, and UTI-related bacteraemia
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Hong Kong has significant rates of ESBL-producing *E. coli* (up to 25–30% of community isolates in recent local data), making empirical antibiotic choice critical. Fluoroquinolone resistance in *E. coli* also exceeds 30% locally
- **DM prevalence**: ~10% of HK adults have DM → increased UTI risk (impaired immunity, glycosuria, neurogenic bladder, diabetic cystopathy)

## 3. Risk Factors

***UTI is a result of the interaction between the host and the uropathogens.*** [1]

### 3.1 General Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Mechanism / Pathophysiology |
|------------|---------------------------|
| ***Female sex*** [2] | Shorter urethra (~4 cm), proximity of urethral meatus to vaginal introitus and anus → easier ascending bacterial migration |
| ***Lack of circumcision*** [2] | ***Mucosal surface of uncircumcised foreskin is more likely to bind uropathogenic bacterial species than keratinised skin on a circumcised penis; partial obstruction of urethral meatus by tight foreskin*** |
| ***Sexual activity*** [2] | Mechanical introduction of periurethral bacteria into the bladder during intercourse ("urethral milking"); classically occurs after first sexual encounter or after a period of abstinence — ***"honeymoon cystitis"*** [4] |
| ***Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)*** [2] | ***Retrograde passage of urine from bladder into upper urinary tract → important risk factor for renal scarring*** |
| ***Urinary obstruction*** [2] | ***Stagnancy of urine increases risk of UTI.*** Anatomical causes: ***posterior urethral valves, ureteropelvic junction obstruction***. Neurological causes: ***myelomeningocele with neurogenic bladder***. Functional causes: ***bladder and bowel dysfunction*** |
| ***Bladder and bowel dysfunction*** [2] | ***Characterised by abnormal elimination pattern (frequent or infrequent voids, daytime wetting, urgency, infrequent stool), bladder or bowel incontinence, withholding manoeuvre*** → incomplete bladder emptying → urine stasis |
| ***Constipation*** [1] | A full rectum compresses the bladder base → incomplete emptying → residual urine → bacterial growth. Particularly important in ***paediatric UTI*** |
| ***Urinary instrumentation / indwelling catheter*** [2] | Bypasses normal defence mechanisms; biofilm formation on catheter surface; 3–7% risk of bacteriuria per day of catheterisation |
| ***Genitourinary abnormalities*** [1] | ***Pelviureteric or vesicoureteric obstruction; ureterocele; posterior urethral valves*** |
| ***Voiding dysfunction*** [1] | ***Abnormal bladder activity, compliance, or emptying*** → residual urine → bacterial proliferation |
| ***Diabetes mellitus*** | Glycosuria provides a substrate for bacterial growth; impaired neutrophil function; autonomic neuropathy → diabetic cystopathy (incomplete emptying, overflow incontinence, recurrent UTI) [5] |
| Pregnancy | Progesterone-mediated ureteral dilation + mechanical compression by gravid uterus → physiological hydronephrosis + urine stasis |
| Immunosuppression | ↓Host immune response → ↓bacterial clearance |
| Post-menopausal oestrogen deficiency | ↓Oestrogen → ↓vaginal glycogen → ↓Lactobacilli → ↑vaginal pH → ↑periurethral colonisation by uropathogens |

### 3.2 Risk Factors for Recurrent UTI

Recurrent UTI is extremely common — ***20% of females with UTI will recur within 6 months*** [4].

#### ***Premenopausal Women*** [1][4]

| Risk Factor | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| ***Sexual intercourse (frequency)*** | Mechanical inoculation of bacteria into bladder |
| ***New sexual partner*** | Exposure to new bacterial flora |
| ***Use of spermicide and diaphragm*** | Spermicides alter vaginal flora (↓Lactobacilli, ↑*E. coli* colonisation); diaphragm causes mechanical obstruction |
| ***Pelvic anatomy (↓urethra-to-anus distance)*** | Shorter distance = easier bacterial migration from perianal area |
| ***Age of first UTI*** | Earlier first UTI suggests greater inherent susceptibility |
| ***Family history (genetic factors)*** | Genetically determined susceptibility of vaginal epithelial cells to uropathogen adherence (e.g. non-secretor status of blood group antigens → ↑bacterial binding) |
| ***Prior antimicrobial use*** | Disrupts normal vaginal and periurethral flora → ↓protective Lactobacilli → ↑colonisation by uropathogens |

#### ***Postmenopausal Women*** [1][4]

| Risk Factor | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| ***Oestrogen deficiency*** | ↓Glycogen in vaginal epithelium → ↓Lactobacilli → ↑pH → ↑colonisation |
| ***Urinary incontinence*** | Moisture and bacterial contamination of perineum |
| ***Presence of cystocele*** | Bladder prolapse → incomplete emptying → residual urine |
| ***Large post-void residual urine*** | Static urine = culture medium for bacteria |
| ***History of UTI before menopause*** | Indicates inherent susceptibility |
| ***Genetic factors*** | As above — cell surface receptor expression |

<Callout title="High Yield: Recurrent UTI Risk Factors" type="idea">
For exams, the risk factor lists for premenopausal vs postmenopausal women come up repeatedly. The key difference: premenopausal factors relate to **sexual activity and anatomy**, while postmenopausal factors relate to **oestrogen deficiency and bladder mechanics**.
</Callout>

## 4. Anatomy and Functional Considerations

Understanding UTI requires understanding the **normal defences** of the urinary tract, because UTI occurs when these defences are breached.

### 4.1 Female vs Male Urinary Tract Anatomy

| Feature | Female | Male |
|---------|--------|------|
| Urethral length | ~4 cm | ~20 cm |
| Proximity to anus | Close (short perineal body) | Distant |
| Prostate | Absent | Present — prostatic secretions contain zinc and other antimicrobial factors |
| Vaginal flora | Provides protective Lactobacilli (oestrogen-dependent) | N/A |

**Why are females more susceptible?** The shorter female urethra means bacteria need to travel a much shorter distance to reach the bladder. The close proximity of the urethral meatus to the vaginal introitus and anus creates a "highway" for faecal flora to colonise the periurethral area and ascend.

### 4.2 Natural Defence Mechanisms of the Urinary Tract

***UTI is a result of the interaction between the host and the uropathogens*** — specifically the ***host's inherent susceptibility, defence mechanisms*** vs the ***uropathogen's virulence and inoculum size.*** [1]

#### 4.2.1 Normal Flora Defence

| Defence Component | Mechanism | Disrupted By |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| ***Lactobacilli in introitus, vagina, and periurethral area*** | ***Produce low vaginal pH (convert glycogen → lactic acid)*** → inhibits uropathogen colonisation | ***Antimicrobial use, spermicidal agents, hypo-oestrogenic state*** [4] |
| ***Cervical IgA*** | Secretory IgA provides mucosal immunity against uropathogens | Immunodeficiency |
| ***Vaginal environment related to oestrogen*** | Oestrogen stimulates glycogen deposition in vaginal epithelium → substrate for Lactobacilli | Menopause, oophorectomy |

#### 4.2.2 Urine Defence

| Defence Component | Mechanism | Disrupted By |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| ***Antegrade flow of urine*** | "Washout" effect — constant flushing of bacteria from the bladder | ***Urinary tract obstruction*** [4] |
| ***Normal pH with high osmolality*** | Unfavourable environment for bacterial growth | Alkalinisation, dilution |
| ***Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin)*** | ***Saturates mannose-binding sites of type 1 pili*** → prevents bacterial adhesion to urothelium [4] | ↓Production in CKD |

#### 4.2.3 Bladder Defence

| Defence Component | Mechanism | Disrupted By |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| ***Normal emptying of bladder*** | Removes bacteria before they can establish infection (residual urine < 50 mL normally) | ***BOO, neurogenic bladder, bladder diverticulum, indwelling catheter, VUR*** [4] |
| ***Normal exfoliation of urothelial cells*** | Infected superficial umbrella cells shed into urine, carrying adherent bacteria with them | Chronic inflammation |
| ***Urothelial innate immunity receptors*** | ***Receptors on superficial urothelial cells recognise LPS → activate innate immunity → ↑local PMN, macrophages → local inflammation*** [4] | Immunosuppression |

#### 4.2.4 Inherent Susceptibility

***Intrinsic susceptibility of vaginal cells to bacterial adherence is genetically determined and directly affects rates of recurrent UTI.*** [4]

- Non-secretors of ABO blood group antigens have ↑expression of specific glycolipid receptors on uroepithelial cells → ↑bacterial binding → ↑UTI risk
- This is why some women get recurrent UTI despite no identifiable anatomical or behavioural risk factor — it's in their genes

## 5. Aetiology and Microbiology

### 5.1 Routes of Infection

| Route | Mechanism | Examples |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| ***Ascending (commonest)*** | ***Rectum → periurethral area → urethra → bladder ± kidney*** | Most community-acquired UTI. ***Facilitated by: indwelling catheter, vesicoureteral reflux, ureteral obstruction*** [4] |
| ***Haematogenous (uncommon)*** | ***Extrarenal source of bacteraemia → secondary infection of kidney*** | ***Renal abscess from septic emboli (e.g. S. aureus endocarditis), genitourinary TB*** [4] |
| ***Direct extension (unusual)*** | ***Spread from neighbouring suppurative infections*** | Diverticulitis, appendicitis, Crohn's disease forming fistula to bladder. ***Uncommon because of thick Gerota's fascia*** [4] |

### 5.2 Microbiology

***Majority caused by facultative anaerobes, mostly from bowel flora.*** [4]

The table below shows the microbiological spectrum by UTI category:

| Organism | ***Uncomplicated UTI*** | ***Complicated UTI*** | ***Nosocomial UTI*** |
|----------|------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| ***E. coli*** | ***75%*** | ***65%*** | ***50%*** |
| ***S. saprophyticus*** | ***6%*** | — | — |
| ***Klebsiella pneumoniae*** | ***6%*** | ***8%*** | + |
| ***Enterococcus spp*** | ***5%*** | ***11%*** | + |
| ***S. agalactiae (GBS)*** | ***3%*** | ***2%*** | — |
| ***Proteus mirabilis*** | ***2%*** | ***2%*** | + |
| ***P. aeruginosa*** | Rare | ***2%*** | + |
| ***S. aureus*** | Rare | ***3%*** | + |
| ***Candida spp*** | Rare | ***7%*** | + |
| Citrobacter, Serratia, Providencia, Enterobacter | Rare | Rare | ***Can be polymicrobial*** |

[2][4]

#### Key Organisms to Know

**E. coli** — the dominant pathogen across all categories:
- Uropathogenic *E. coli* (UPEC) possesses specific virulence factors (see below)
- Community-acquired uncomplicated UTI: 75–95% caused by *E. coli*
- **In Hong Kong**: high rates of ESBL-producing and fluoroquinolone-resistant *E. coli* — this impacts empirical therapy

***S. saprophyticus*** — "staph. sapro":
- Second commonest cause of uncomplicated UTI in **young sexually active women**
- Gram-positive coccus; characteristically **novobiocin-resistant** (distinguishes it from *S. epidermidis*)

**Proteus mirabilis**:
- Produces **urease** → breaks down urea into ammonia → **alkalinises urine** → promotes **struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate) stone formation**
- Think of Proteus when you see recurrent UTI + alkaline urine + staghorn calculi

**Klebsiella pneumoniae**:
- Second commonest Gram-negative cause after *E. coli*
- Important in complicated/nosocomial UTI
- In HK: rising carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella is a concern

**Pseudomonas aeruginosa**:
- Important in catheter-associated and nosocomial UTI
- Intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics
- Think of Pseudomonas in recurrent UTI with instrumentation/catheter history

**Enterococcus spp**:
- Intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins
- Important in complicated and catheter-associated UTI
- Treat with amoxicillin or vancomycin (if VRE, use linezolid or daptomycin)

**Candida spp**:
- Think fungal UTI in: ICU patients, prolonged antibiotics, immunosuppressed, indwelling catheter, diabetics

#### Special Pathogens

- **Adenovirus** (types 11, 21): haemorrhagic cystitis in children and immunocompromised
- **Schistosoma haematobium**: granulomatous cystitis → squamous cell carcinoma of bladder (rare in HK but important for travel history)
- **Mycobacterium tuberculosis**: sterile pyuria (WBCs but culture-negative on routine media) — always consider in HK given TB prevalence

### 5.3 Bacterial Virulence Factors

***Bacterial virulence: characteristics of uropathogens that allow them to colonise and invade the urinary tract.*** [1]

***Can be divided into:***
- ***Factors against external agents, e.g. antimicrobial resistance*** [1]
- ***Factors against the host*** [1]

#### Virulence Factors Against the Host (Focus on UPEC)

| Virulence Factor | Function | Clinical Relevance |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| ***Type 1 (mannose-sensitive) pili (FimH, FimA)*** | ***Commonly expressed in E. coli; found in majority of isolates from acute cystitis*** [4] | Binds to uroplakin on bladder epithelium → mediates colonisation of the lower tract |
| ***Type P (mannose-resistant) pili (PapG, X-adhesin)*** | ***Binds preferentially to upper tract urothelium; found in 80% of isolates from acute pyelonephritis*** [4] | The "P" stands for pyelonephritis — these pili allow bacteria to ascend and infect the kidney |
| ***Type S pili*** | ***Both bladder and kidney infection*** [4] | — |
| ***Afimbrial adhesins (e.g. Dr adhesin family)*** | Mediates binding independent of pili | Important in recurrent/complicated UTI |
| ***Haemolysin (HlyA)*** | ***Toxin → forms pores in host cell membrane and RBC lysis*** [4] | Tissue damage → facilitates invasion and nutrient acquisition |
| ***Urease*** | ***Breaks down urea into ammonia*** [4] | Alkalinises urine → struvite stone formation (Proteus, Klebsiella) |
| ***IgA inactivating protein*** | Degrades secretory IgA | Evades mucosal immunity |
| ***Phasic variation of piliated state*** | Bacteria can switch pili on/off | Evades immune recognition; adapts to different niches |
| Siderophores (e.g. aerobactin) | Iron acquisition systems | Scavenges iron from host → essential for bacterial growth |
| Capsular polysaccharide (K antigen) | Resists phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing | ↑Survival in bloodstream → important in urosepsis |
| Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) | Endotoxin → activates TLR4 → systemic inflammatory response | Triggers sepsis cascade if bacteria enter bloodstream |

---

## 6. Pathophysiology

### 6.1 Step-by-Step Pathogenesis of Ascending UTI

This is the **overwhelmingly commonest** route:

```
1. Colonisation of periurethral area by uropathogenic enteric pathogen
   (usually from faecal flora, especially E. coli)
                    ↓
2. Bacterial ascent through the urethra into the bladder
   (facilitated by short female urethra, sexual intercourse, catheterisation)
                    ↓
3. Attachment to uroepithelial cells via active receptor-mediated process
   - Mediated by glycosphingolipid receptors on epithelial cell surface
   - Type 1 pili (FimH) bind to uroplakin Ia on umbrella cells
                    ↓
4. Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation
   - Bacterial attachment recruits TLRs (transmembrane co-receptors)
   - TLR4 recognises LPS → triggers cytokine cascade (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α)
   - Generates local inflammatory response → PMN recruitment → pyuria
                    ↓
5. Bacterial proliferation in bladder → CYSTITIS
   (if host defences overwhelmed or impaired)
                    ↓
6. ± Ascent into ureters and kidney → PYELONEPHRITIS
   - Bacteria with P-pili adhere to upper tract urothelium
   - Facilitated by VUR, ureteral obstruction, or catheterisation
                    ↓
7. ± Invasion into bloodstream → UROSEPSIS
   (if renal parenchymal barrier breached)
```

### 6.2 Why Do Bacteria Cause Symptoms?

Understanding why UTI produces specific symptoms connects directly to the inflammatory response:

- **Dysuria** (painful urination): Inflammation of the bladder/urethral mucosa → exposure of sensory nerve endings to inflammatory mediators + urine acidity
- **Frequency and urgency**: Inflamed bladder wall has ↓compliance and ↑irritability → the detrusor muscle contracts at lower volumes → premature sense of fullness
- **Suprapubic pain**: Peritoneal irritation from inflamed bladder dome (the dome is covered by peritoneum)
- **Haematuria**: Mucosal inflammation → capillary damage → blood in urine
- **Fever**: Systemic response to infection — more prominent in upper tract infection where bacteria have access to the bloodstream through the renal parenchyma's rich blood supply
- **Loin/flank pain**: Renal capsular distension from oedema and inflammation (pyelonephritis), or obstruction

### 6.3 Haematogenous Route

- **Uncommon** for typical UTI organisms
- **S. aureus** is the classic organism that seeds the kidney via the bloodstream (e.g., from endocarditis or infected IV lines)
- **Genitourinary TB**: Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads haematogenously from a primary pulmonary focus to the highly vascular renal cortex → caseous granulomas → "autonephrectomy" in severe cases

### 6.4 Pathophysiology of Special UTI Entities

#### Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN)

***EPN pathogenesis*** [1]:
- ***Factors: high glucose level, gas-forming microbes, impaired vascular blood supply, reduced host immunity, urinary tract obstruction*** [1]
- ***Mechanism: G-negative facultative anaerobes e.g. E. coli produce gas via fermentation of glucose → high levels of nitrogen, oxygen, CO₂ and H₂ accumulating at inflammatory site → gas may extend from the inflammatory site to subcapsular, perinephric and pararenal spaces*** [1]

***EPN associated factors*** [1]:
- ***DM — single most common factor***
- ***Female > Male***
- ***Urinary tract obstruction***
- ***Stones***
- ***Immunocompromised***

#### Emphysematous Cystitis (EC)

***EC*** [1]:
- ***DDx: instrumentation, fistula to hollow viscus, tissue infarct with necrosis, infection***
- ***EC more common in middle-aged diabetic women (M:F = 1:6)***
- ***Predisposing factors: DM (66%), chronic UTI, indwelling urethral catheter, urinary stasis due to BOO, neurogenic bladder***
- ***Various S/S: asymptomatic, pneumaturia, irritative voiding, acute abdomen to severe sepsis***
- ***Pathogens: similar to EPN***
- ***Pathogenesis: like EPN; in non-diabetic patients: urinary albumin as substrate*** (rather than glucose)

## 7. Classification

UTI can be classified along multiple axes:

### 7.1 By Anatomical Location

| Classification | Site | Definition |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| **Upper UTI** | Kidney (± ureter) | ***Acute pyelonephritis is defined as bacteriuria with (i) fever ≥ 38.0°C or (ii) loin pain or tenderness*** [2] |
| **Lower UTI** | Bladder / Prostate / Urethra | Cystitis, prostatitis, urethritis |

### 7.2 By Structural/Functional Abnormalities (Uncomplicated vs Complicated)

***Uncomplicated UTI*** [1][2]:
- ***In anatomically, physiologically normal urinary tract with normal host defence mechanisms (i.e. otherwise normal individuals)***
- ***Usual uropathogens such as E. coli (70–95%)***
- ***Outpatient treatment***
- ***Shorter duration of treatment***
- ***No increased risk of failing standard therapy***

***Complicated UTI*** [1][2]:
- ***E.g. neuropathic bladder, urinary tract obstruction, bladder diverticulum, presence of stones***
- ***↑Risk of acquiring infection and failing treatment***
- ***Broader spectrum of pathogens, often drug-resistant***
- ***Admission may be required***
- ***Longer duration of treatment***
- ***Measures should be made to eradicate the complicating feature***

***Special groups: pregnancy, children*** [1]

<Callout title="Complicated UTI - What Makes It 'Complicated'?">
Any structural abnormality (stones, obstruction, diverticulum), functional abnormality (neurogenic bladder, VUR), foreign body (catheter, stent), or immunocompromised state (DM, transplant, neutropenia) that either increases the risk of infection or the risk of treatment failure makes a UTI "complicated." The practical implication: you need a broader antibiotic spectrum, longer treatment duration, and investigation for the underlying cause.
</Callout>

### 7.3 By Clinical Course

| Classification | Definition | Key Points |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| ***Isolated UTI*** | ***UTI isolated from the last episode by > 6 months*** [4] | First episode or infrequent occurrence |
| ***Recurrent UTI*** | ***UTI after resolution of previous one, occurring ≥ 2×/6 months or ≥ 3×/12 months*** [4] | ***Documented by negative culture in between episodes*** |

Recurrent UTI is further subdivided:

| Type | Definition | Cause | Frequency |
|------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| ***Bacterial reinfection*** | ***Recurrent infection from a source outside the urinary tract, caused by different organisms (although it may be the same genera and species)*** | ***Due to underlying susceptibility to UTI (genetically determined → not amenable to correction)*** | ***> 95% of recurrent UTIs in women*** [4] |
| ***Bacterial persistence / relapse*** | ***Recurrent infection due to a focus within the urinary tract, caused by the same organism (exactly the same strain)*** | ***E.g. stones, urethral diverticulum*** | ***Potentially correctable by removal of infective focus*** [4] |

### 7.4 By Clinical Syndromes

***Classification by clinical syndromes*** [4]:
1. ***Asymptomatic bacteriuria***
2. ***Acute bacterial infections:***
   - ***Upper tract: pyelonephritis, pyonephrosis, renal abscess***
   - ***Lower tract: cystitis, prostatitis, epididymo-orchitis, urethritis and STDs***
3. ***Other infections: mycobacterial, parasitic, fungal infections***

### 7.5 EAU/IDSA Classification System (with Diagnostic Criteria)

The table from the lecture slides summarises the categories:

| Category | Clinical Features | Laboratory Criteria |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| ***1. Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women*** | ***Dysuria, urgency, frequency, suprapubic pain, no urinary symptoms in 4 weeks before*** | ***> 10 WBC/mm³; > 10³ CFU/mL*** |
| ***2. Acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis*** | ***Fever, chills, flank pain; other diagnoses excluded; no history or clinical evidence of urological abnormalities (ultrasonography, radiography)*** | ***> 10 WBC/mm³; > 10⁴ CFU/mL*** |
| ***3. Complicated UTI*** | ***Any combination of symptoms from categories 1 and 2; one or more complicating factors*** | ***> 10 WBC/mm³; > 10⁵ CFU/mL in women, > 10⁴ CFU/mL in men or in straight catheter urine in women*** |
| ***4. Asymptomatic bacteriuria*** | ***No urinary symptoms*** | ***> 10 WBC/mm³; > 10⁵ CFU/mL in two consecutive MSU cultures > 24 hours apart*** |
| ***5. Recurrent UTI (antimicrobial prophylaxis)*** | ***At least 3 episodes of uncomplicated infection documented by culture in last 12 months; women only; no structural/functional abnormalities*** | ***< 10³ CFU/mL (between episodes)*** |

[1]

## 8. Clinical Features

### 8.1 Symptoms

#### 8.1.1 Lower UTI (Cystitis)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Dysuria** (painful/burning urination) | Inflammation of bladder/urethral mucosa → inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, bradykinin) sensitise nociceptors → pain on contact with urine (acidic) |
| **Frequency** (voiding more often than usual) | Inflamed detrusor muscle has ↓compliance and ↑sensitivity → contracts at lower bladder volumes → reduced functional capacity |
| **Urgency** (sudden compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer) | Same mechanism as frequency — ↑afferent signalling from inflamed mucosa → overwhelming urge |
| **Suprapubic pain/discomfort** | Inflammation of the bladder dome (which is covered by peritoneum) → visceral pain referred to suprapubic region via T10-L1 sympathetic afferents |
| **Nocturia** (waking from sleep to void) | Reduced functional bladder capacity from inflammation → even normal nocturnal urine production causes multiple awakenings |
| **Haematuria** (blood in urine) | Mucosal inflammation and capillary damage in the bladder wall → bleeding. Can be gross (visible) or microscopic |
| **Turbid/cloudy urine** | Pyuria (WBCs) + bacteria + cellular debris → urine appears cloudy |
| **Malodorous urine** | Bacterial metabolism of urea and other urinary constituents → volatile amines and ammonia |

> **Tip**: Lower UTI presents with **storage LUTS** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia) because the problem is an inflamed bladder that cannot store urine comfortably. There should be no systemic symptoms (fever, rigors) — if present, think upper tract involvement.

#### 8.1.2 Upper UTI (Acute Pyelonephritis)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Fever (≥ 38°C) with rigors/chills** | Bacteria invade renal parenchyma → access the highly vascular renal bed → bacterial products (LPS) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) enter systemic circulation → hypothalamic set-point elevation |
| **Loin/flank pain (unilateral or bilateral)** | Infection → renal parenchymal oedema → distension of the renal capsule (which is richly innervated) → somatic pain localised to the flank. May radiate to groin via T10-L1 dermatomes |
| **Nausea and vomiting** | (i) Visceral pain → vagal stimulation → emesis. (ii) Systemic toxaemia from bacteraemia |
| **Malaise and fatigue** | Systemic inflammatory response → cytokine-mediated sickness behaviour |
| **Lower tract symptoms** | Often present concurrently as infection ascended from below |

#### 8.1.3 Acute Prostatitis (Males)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Systemic disturbance (high fever, chills, malaise)** | Prostatic infection with rich blood supply → easy systemic dissemination |
| **Deep pelvic/perineal pain** | Inflammation of the prostate → capsular distension → pain felt deep in pelvis/perineum (innervation via S2-S4 pudendal nerve) |
| **Obstructive voiding symptoms** | Acutely swollen, oedematous prostate compresses the prostatic urethra → poor flow, hesitancy, incomplete emptying |
| **Dysuria** | Inflammation at the prostatic urethra |

#### 8.1.4 Chronic Prostatitis

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Subtle/recurrent UTI symptoms** | Low-grade persistent prostatic infection serving as a focus of bacterial persistence |
| **Low-grade fever** | Chronic inflammatory response |
| **Deep pain (pelvis, perineum, scrotum, especially during ejaculation)** | Chronic prostatic inflammation → irritation of periprostatic nerves |
| **Haematospermia** | Inflammation → capillary damage in prostatic/seminal vesicle epithelium |
| **± Obstructive symptoms** | Chronic inflammation → prostatic fibrosis/oedema |

#### 8.1.5 Acute Epididymitis/Epididymo-orchitis

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Unilateral testicular pain** | Inflammation of epididymis → stretching of the tunica vaginalis → localised pain. Typically starts posterolaterally (where epididymis sits) |
| **Storage LUTS** | Often concurrent lower UTI (ascending infection via vas deferens) |
| **High fever/rigors** | Systemic response; epididymis has good blood supply |

#### 8.1.6 Paediatric UTI

***Children (especially neonates and infants)*** present **atypically** [1]:

| Age Group | Presentation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Neonates | Non-specific: fever, irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, jaundice, failure to thrive, sepsis. **UTI is a common cause of neonatal sepsis** |
| Infants (< 2 years) | Fever (often the only sign), irritability, poor feeding, vomiting, malodorous urine, failure to thrive |
| Toddlers/preschool | Fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, new-onset enuresis, frequency, dysuria |
| Older children | More "classic" — dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, haematuria, fever (if upper tract) |

<Callout title="Key Clinical Point" type="error">
In neonates and infants, the classic triad of dysuria-frequency-urgency is **absent**. Unexplained fever in a child < 2 years old mandates urine testing to rule out UTI. This is a frequently tested clinical scenario.
</Callout>

#### 8.1.7 UTI in the Elderly

- Presentation can be **atypical and non-specific**: confusion, falls, functional decline, incontinence, anorexia
- **Beware**: Asymptomatic bacteriuria is extremely common in the elderly (up to 50% in institutionalised patients) — do NOT treat positive urine cultures without genuine UTI symptoms
- Fever may be blunted due to impaired thermoregulatory response

### 8.2 Signs

#### 8.2.1 Lower UTI (Cystitis)

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|------|------------------------|
| **Suprapubic tenderness** | Palpation compresses the inflamed bladder → pain. Elicit by firm pressure over the suprapubic region |
| **Low-grade fever or afebrile** | Lower tract infection is generally mucosal/superficial → limited systemic inflammatory response |
| **Turbid urine on inspection** | Pyuria, bacteria, debris |

#### 8.2.2 Upper UTI (Acute Pyelonephritis)

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|------|------------------------|
| **High fever (≥ 38°C), often spiking** | Systemic bacteraemia from infected renal parenchyma |
| **Costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness** / **Renal angle tenderness** | Fist percussion over the 12th rib posteriorly (Murphy's kidney punch) stretches the inflamed, oedematous renal capsule → pain. This is the **hallmark physical sign** of pyelonephritis |
| **Tachycardia** | Fever-related (↑HR by ~10 bpm per °C above 37°C) + systemic inflammatory response |
| **± Hypotension** | If progressed to urosepsis → vasodilation and ↓SVR from septic mediators |
| **± Septic appearance** (toxic, rigors) | Bacteraemia → cytokine storm |

#### 8.2.3 Acute Prostatitis

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|------|------------------------|
| **DRE: exquisitely tender, swollen, "boggy" prostate** | Acute inflammation → oedema and abscess formation → extremely painful on palpation. **Important**: be GENTLE — vigorous DRE can cause bacteraemia |
| **Fever** | Systemic response |

#### 8.2.4 Acute Epididymo-orchitis

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|------|------------------------|
| **Tender, swollen epididymis ± testis** | Inflammatory oedema |
| **Positive Prehn's sign** (relief of pain with scrotal elevation) | Elevating the scrotum ↓venous congestion and ↓stretch on the inflamed cord → pain relief. (Helps distinguish from testicular torsion where elevation does NOT relieve pain) |
| **Erythematous, warm scrotal skin** | Local inflammation → vasodilation |
| **Cremasteric reflex present** | Intact in epididymitis (absent in torsion) |

#### 8.2.5 Paediatric UTI

| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|------|------------------------|
| **Fever** | Often the ONLY sign in infants |
| **Abdominal/suprapubic tenderness** | Bladder inflammation |
| **Palpable kidneys or bladder** | If there is associated obstructive uropathy (e.g. posterior urethral valves) |
| **Examine for phimosis (boys)** | Tight foreskin → ↑UTI risk |
| **Examine external genitalia** | Rule out labial adhesion (girls), hypospadias, abnormal urethral meatus |
| **Check spine for midline defects** | Sacral dimple, hairy patch → occult spinal dysraphism → neurogenic bladder |

## 9. Special Considerations in Paediatric Urology and UTI

*(From GC 213 and Pediatric urology lecture slides)*

### 9.1 Key Paediatric UTI Risk Factors (Recap)

***Risk factors of UTI in children*** [1]:
- ***Age: neonates and infants have increased bacterial colonisation of the periurethral area and an immature immune system, especially first few weeks***
- ***Vesicoureteric reflux***
- ***Genitourinary abnormalities (pelviureteric or vesicoureteric obstruction; ureterocele; posterior urethral valves)***
- ***Voiding dysfunction (abnormal bladder activity, compliance, or emptying)***
- ***Foreskin: uncircumcised boys have a 10-fold higher risk of UTI in the first year due to bacterial colonisation of the glans and foreskin***
- ***Constipation***

### 9.2 Vesicoureteral Reflux (VUR)

**Why is VUR important?**
- VUR allows infected urine to travel retrogradely from the bladder to the kidney → **reflux nephropathy** → **renal scarring** → CKD and hypertension
- VUR is found in **30–50% of children** presenting with UTI
- Most cases are **primary** (congenital short intramural ureter → incompetent flap valve mechanism at the ureterovesical junction)
- VUR is graded I–V (International Reflux Study):
  - I–II: into ureter only or non-dilated collecting system
  - III: moderate ureteral/pelvic dilation
  - IV–V: gross dilation with tortuous ureters and loss of papillary impression

### 9.3 Posterior Urethral Valves (PUV)

- **Most common cause of congenital bladder outlet obstruction in males**
- Obstructing membrane in the posterior urethra → bilateral hydroureteronephrosis → renal dysplasia if severe
- Presents: antenatal hydronephrosis, poor urinary stream, UTI, failure to thrive, renal failure
- Diagnosis: MCUG (micturating cystourethrogram)
- Management: valve ablation (endoscopic) ± temporary vesicostomy if severe

### 9.4 Bladder and Bowel Dysfunction (BBD)

***Bladder and bowel dysfunction is characterised by:*** [2]
- ***Abnormal elimination pattern (frequent or infrequent voids, daytime wetting, urgency, infrequent stool)***
- ***Bladder or bowel incontinence***
- ***Withholding manoeuvre***

**Why does this matter for UTI?**
- Incomplete bladder emptying → residual urine → bacterial proliferation
- Constipation → rectal distension compresses bladder → ↓bladder capacity and ↑residual volume
- BBD perpetuates UTI and VUR → must treat both to break the cycle

## 10. Link to Urinary Incontinence and Overactive Bladder

*(From GC 209 lecture slides)*

While urinary incontinence (UI) and overactive bladder (OAB) are separate conditions from UTI, they are closely **interrelated**:

- **UTI → OAB symptoms**: Bladder inflammation → detrusor irritability → urgency, frequency, urge incontinence. This is why you must always rule out UTI before diagnosing OAB
- **UI → ↑UTI risk**: Incontinence → perineal moisture → ↑periurethral bacterial colonisation → ↑ascending infection risk (especially in postmenopausal women and elderly)
- **Overflow incontinence → UTI**: Chronic retention (e.g., neurogenic bladder from DM, BPH) → large post-void residual → bacterial stasis → recurrent UTI [5]

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
In a patient presenting with new-onset urgency and frequency, always do a urinalysis and urine culture FIRST to rule out UTI before labelling them as "overactive bladder." UTI is a reversible cause of OAB symptoms.
</Callout>

## 11. Diabetic Cystopathy and UTI

From the endocrine notes [5]:

***Diabetic autonomic neuropathy — genitourinary manifestations:***
- ***Bladder dysfunction: ↓ability to sense full bladder, incomplete emptying, recurrent UTI, overflow incontinence***

**Pathophysiology**: 
- Chronic hyperglycaemia → metabolic/osmotic damage to autonomic nerves supplying the detrusor and bladder sensory afferents → **↓bladder sensation** (patient doesn't feel the urge to void) → **↑bladder capacity** → **↓detrusor contractility** → **↑post-void residual** → stagnant urine → recurrent UTI
- Additionally: glycosuria provides excellent substrate for bacterial growth

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Definition**: UTI = inflammatory response of urothelium to bacterial invasion, associated with bacteriuria AND pyuria. Bacteriuria alone ≠ UTI. Pyuria alone ≠ UTI.

**Epidemiology**: Commonest bacterial infection; 50% of women will have UTI in lifetime; F >>> M (except neonates where M > F); incidence ↑ with age and sexual activity.

**Risk Factors**:
- Female sex (short urethra), sexual activity, lack of circumcision, VUR, urinary obstruction, BBD, constipation, catheterisation, DM, oestrogen deficiency
- Recurrent UTI: premenopausal = sexual activity + anatomy + genetics; postmenopausal = oestrogen deficiency + bladder mechanics

**Microbiology**: E. coli dominates (75% uncomplicated, 65% complicated, 50% nosocomial). S. saprophyticus in young sexually active women. Proteus = struvite stones. Broader spectrum + resistance in complicated/nosocomial UTI.

**Pathogenesis**: Ascending route commonest → faecal flora colonise periurethral area → ascend via urethra → adhere via pili (Type 1 for cystitis, Type P for pyelonephritis) → TLR activation → inflammatory cascade → symptoms.

**Classification**: Upper vs Lower; Uncomplicated vs Complicated; Isolated vs Recurrent (reinfection vs persistence); Clinical syndromes (ABU, cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, etc.).

**Clinical Features**:
- Lower UTI: dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, haematuria, NO systemic symptoms
- Upper UTI: fever ≥ 38°C, loin pain/CVA tenderness, rigors, ± lower tract symptoms
- Children: atypical — fever, irritability, poor feeding (always test urine in febrile child < 2 years)
- Elderly: atypical — confusion, falls, functional decline (but don't over-treat asymptomatic bacteriuria)

**Host Defences**: Vaginal flora (Lactobacilli, low pH), antegrade urine flow, Tamm-Horsfall protein, normal bladder emptying, urothelial innate immunity (TLR recognition of LPS), genetic susceptibility of epithelial cells.

**Virulence Factors**: Pili (Type 1 = cystitis, Type P = pyelonephritis), haemolysin, urease, capsular K antigen, LPS, siderophores, antimicrobial resistance.
