## Complications of Urinary Tract Infection

UTI complications are best understood by thinking about **what happens when infection is not contained or treated adequately** — bacteria can spread locally, spread systemically, cause structural damage, or establish a chronic focus. The complications differ depending on whether the UTI is lower tract, upper tract, or complicated, and whether the patient is an adult, a child, or has special risk factors.

Let's work through these systematically.

---

### 1. Local Complications (Spread of Infection Within the Urinary Tract)

#### 1.1 Ascending Infection: Cystitis → Pyelonephritis

The most fundamental "complication" of lower UTI is its **ascent into the upper tract**. Uncomplicated cystitis in a healthy woman rarely progresses, but in the presence of complicating factors (VUR, obstruction, catheter, DM, immunosuppression), bacteria can ascend the ureters and invade the renal parenchyma.

**Why does this matter?** Because the kidney, unlike the bladder, has a **rich blood supply** that communicates directly with the systemic circulation. Once bacteria reach the renal parenchyma, they have a portal into the bloodstream → potential for **bacteraemia and sepsis**. The bladder mucosa, by contrast, is relatively avascular and acts as a barrier to systemic spread — which is why uncomplicated cystitis almost never causes fever or bacteraemia.

#### 1.2 Renal and Perinephric Abscess

***± Complications: especially if obstruction, recent instrumentation, prior urinary tract abnormalities, DM, immunocompromised*** [4]

***Spread of infection: renal corticomedullary abscess, perinephric abscess*** [4]

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Features | Diagnosis | Management |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| **Renal abscess** (intrarenal) | Coalescence of microabscesses within the renal parenchyma, arising from severe pyelonephritis (ascending, usually Gram-negative) or haematogenous seeding (usually *S. aureus*) | ***Insidious onset of: vague loin pain, CVA tenderness, erythema; systemic upset: low-grade fever, pallor, fatigue, sweats, weight loss; ± S/S of background UTI (not always present)*** [4] | CT A+P with contrast: rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within renal parenchyma | Small ( < 3 cm): IV antibiotics alone (4–6 weeks). Large ( > 3–5 cm) or failing medical Rx: **percutaneous drainage** + antibiotics |
| **Perinephric abscess** | Rupture of renal abscess through the renal capsule into the perinephric space (between renal capsule and Gerota's fascia) | As above but more indolent; may have **psoas spasm** (hip flexion) if abscess irritates psoas muscle | CT A+P: collection in perinephric space, loss of perinephric fat planes | **Percutaneous or surgical drainage** mandatory + prolonged IV antibiotics |

***Risk factors: DM, pregnancy, anatomical abnormalities (renal stones, PCKD, renal cyst, obstructive tumour), functional abnormalities (neurogenic bladder, VUR)*** [4]

***Microbiology: E. coli (51.4%), S. aureus (10.0%), K. pneumoniae (8.6%)*** [4]

**Why does DM keep appearing as a risk factor?** Diabetes creates a "perfect storm" for complicated UTI:
1. Glycosuria = substrate for bacterial growth
2. Diabetic cystopathy = neurogenic bladder → incomplete emptying → stasis
3. Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and phagocytosis → ↓bacterial clearance
4. Microangiopathy → impaired tissue perfusion → ↓antibiotic delivery to infected tissue

#### 1.3 Pyonephrosis

"Pyo" (Greek: πύον) = pus + "nephrosis" = kidney condition. This is **pus under pressure in an obstructed collecting system** — a **urological emergency**.

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Pathophysiology** | Infected urine trapped behind an obstruction (stone, tumour, stricture) → pus accumulates in the dilated collecting system → increasing pressure → renal parenchymal damage → bacteraemia |
| **Why is it an emergency?** | Antibiotics CANNOT sterilise pus under pressure (poor penetration into a non-perfused, obstructed system). Untreated, it progresses rapidly to **urosepsis, septic shock, and death** |
| **Clinical features** | Fever, rigors, loin pain, CVA tenderness + evidence of obstruction (hydronephrosis on USG with echogenic debris in collecting system) |
| **Management** | **Emergency drainage**: PCN (preferred in septic shock — quicker) or JJ stent (retrograde). Antibiotics are adjunctive, not sufficient alone |

#### 1.4 Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN)

This is a **life-threatening necrotising infection** characterised by gas formation within the renal parenchyma and surrounding tissues. Covered in detail in the management section. Key complication points:

- Mortality historically 50–80% if treated medically alone; with modern approach (PCD + antibiotics ± nephrectomy), mortality ~20%
- ***EPN associated factors: DM — single most common factor; Female > Male; urinary tract obstruction; stones; immunocompromised*** [1]

#### 1.5 Emphysematous Cystitis (EC)

Gas formation in the bladder wall. Less immediately dangerous than EPN but can progress:

***Various S/S: asymptomatic, pneumaturia, irritative voiding, acute abdomen to severe sepsis*** [1]

#### 1.6 Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis (XGP)

A rare, chronic destructive granulomatous process of the kidney, almost always unilateral:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Pathophysiology** | Chronic obstruction (often staghorn calculus) + chronic infection → macrophages laden with lipid ("foamy macrophages") infiltrate and destroy renal parenchyma |
| **Associations** | Staghorn stones, Proteus or *E. coli* infection, DM |
| **Clinical features** | Chronic malaise, weight loss, recurrent UTI, non-functioning kidney on imaging |
| **Key imaging** | CT: enlarged non-functioning kidney with calcification + multiple hypodense areas (replacing parenchyma) — the "bear paw" sign |
| **Management** | **Nephrectomy** (medical treatment alone is insufficient) |

---

### 2. Systemic Complications

#### 2.1 Urosepsis

***Urosepsis: systemic sepsis, shock, multi-organ failure*** [4]

Urosepsis is the most feared systemic complication of UTI. It occurs when bacteria and their products (especially Gram-negative LPS endotoxin) enter the bloodstream from an infected urinary tract → triggering the **systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)** → sepsis → septic shock → multi-organ dysfunction.

| Stage | Definition | Pathophysiology |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| **Bacteraemia** | Bacteria detectable in the bloodstream | Passage of bacteria from renal parenchyma (or instrumented urinary tract) into venous blood |
| **Sepsis** | Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection (Sepsis-3) | LPS activates TLR4 → massive cytokine release (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) → endothelial activation → widespread vasodilation, capillary leak, microthrombi |
| **Septic shock** | Sepsis + vasopressor requirement to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg + lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation | Refractory vasodilation from overwhelming NO production; myocardial depression; DIC → end-organ hypoperfusion |
| **Multi-organ failure** | ≥ 2 organ systems failing | Kidneys (AKI), lungs (ARDS), liver (cholestatic jaundice), coagulopathy (DIC), brain (encephalopathy) |

**Risk factors for urosepsis:**
- Obstruction (the single most important factor — pus under pressure)
- Recent urological instrumentation
- DM and immunosuppression
- ***Complicated UTI: ↑risk of progression into sepsis/death*** [4]
- Elderly and frail patients

**Management**: Sepsis bundles (SSC guidelines) — early recognition, blood cultures, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour, aggressive fluid resuscitation, vasopressors if needed, source control (drainage of obstructed/infected system).

#### 2.2 Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)

***Acute renal failure*** [4] can complicate UTI through multiple mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Example | Category |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Post-renal (obstructive)** | ***UTI*** listed as a post-renal cause of AKI: infected obstructing stone, pyonephrosis → ***must be bilateral*** to cause AKI from obstruction alone [6] | Post-renal |
| **Pre-renal** | Sepsis-induced hypotension → ↓renal perfusion → ↓GFR | Pre-renal |
| **Intrinsic renal** | Severe pyelonephritis → ATN from sepsis; aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity from treatment | Renal |

***Prolonged pre-renal and post-renal disease will progress to become ATN and tubulointerstitial fibrosis respectively, i.e. intrinsic renal disease*** [6]

This is why early recognition and treatment matter — reversible pre-renal and post-renal AKI become irreversible intrinsic renal damage if left too long.

### 3. Complications of Specific UTI Subtypes

#### 3.1 Complications of Acute Prostatitis

***± Complications: bacteraemia and sepsis, endocarditis, epididymitis, chronic prostatitis, prostatic abscess*** [4]

| Complication | Pathophysiology | Clinical Clue |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Bacteraemia/sepsis** | Rich prostatic blood supply → easy systemic dissemination | Spiking fevers, rigors, positive blood cultures |
| **Endocarditis** | Haematogenous seeding of heart valves from prostatic bacteraemia | New murmur, embolic phenomena (rare but devastating) |
| **Epididymitis** | Infection travels retrogradely via vas deferens from prostate to epididymis | Unilateral scrotal pain + swelling following prostatitis symptoms |
| **Chronic prostatitis** | Inadequately treated acute prostatitis → chronic bacterial focus within prostate | Recurrent UTI with same organism; perineal/pelvic pain; haematospermia |
| **Prostatic abscess** | Liquefactive necrosis within prostate parenchyma | Failure to defervesce despite antibiotics; fluctuant prostate on DRE. Dx: CT or TRUS. Mx: drainage |

#### 3.2 Complications in Pregnancy

UTI (and especially untreated asymptomatic bacteriuria) in pregnancy carries specific risks:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Pyelonephritis** | 20–40% of untreated ASB in pregnancy progresses to pyelonephritis (progesterone-mediated ureteral dilation + mechanical compression by gravid uterus → stasis) |
| **Preterm delivery** | Endotoxin and prostaglandins from UTI stimulate uterine contractions |
| **Low birth weight** | Chronic infection/inflammation impairs placental function |
| **Pre-eclampsia** | Epidemiological association with recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis |

This is precisely why asymptomatic bacteriuria is screened for and treated in pregnancy — it's the only reliable way to prevent these complications.

---

### 4. Chronic / Long-Term Complications

#### 4.1 Renal Scarring (Reflux Nephropathy)

This is the **most important long-term complication in paediatric UTI**:

| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Pathophysiology** | VUR → infected urine refluxes into the kidney → **intrarenal reflux** (compound papillae in the renal poles allow reflux into collecting ducts) → parenchymal inflammation → fibrosis and scarring |
| **Why children?** | (1) VUR is more common (30–50% of children with UTI); (2) Growing kidneys are more susceptible to scarring; (3) Compound papillae (which allow intrarenal reflux) are more common at the renal poles in children |
| **Consequences** | CKD (segmental scarring → loss of functioning nephrons → progressive renal failure); **hypertension** (renin-angiotensin activation from ischaemic scarred segments); proteinuria |
| **Detection** | ***DMSA scan: done 4–6 months after acute infection to detect the formation of scarring*** [2] |
| **Prevention** | Prompt treatment of UTI; antibiotic prophylaxis in VUR ≥ Grade 3; surgical correction if recurrent UTI + scarring + high-grade VUR |

***Urinary tract TB: often diagnosed late with complications such as urethral or ureteric strictures, renal failure, infertility*** [1]

#### 4.2 Struvite (Infection) Stones

Recurrent UTI with urease-producing organisms (Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, *Staphylococcus*) creates a vicious cycle:

```
Urease-producing bacteria colonise urinary tract
            ↓
Urease breaks down urea → ammonia + CO₂
            ↓
Ammonia alkalinises urine (pH > 7.5)
            ↓
Supersaturation with magnesium ammonium phosphate
            ↓
STRUVITE STONE formation (can grow rapidly into staghorn calculi)
            ↓
Stone acts as nidus for bacterial persistence → recurrent UTI
            ↓
Cycle perpetuates
```

***Struvite crystal due to urease-positive bacterial infection*** [3]. This is why repeated *Proteus* spp isolation should prompt imaging to look for stones [4].

#### 4.3 Chronic Pyelonephritis

Repeated episodes of pyelonephritis (particularly with VUR or obstruction) → progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis → cortical thinning and scarring → **CKD** → eventually **end-stage renal disease** in severe cases.

#### 4.4 Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder

Chronic UTI and chronic indwelling catheter use (years) → chronic irritation → squamous metaplasia of the urothelium → **squamous cell carcinoma** (not the usual transitional cell carcinoma). This is:
- Seen in patients with **long-term indwelling catheters** (> 10 years)
- Associated with ***chronic UTI*** as a risk factor [8]
- Also associated with schistosomiasis (S. haematobium — not common in HK but important for travel history)

---

### 5. Catheter-Related Complications

Since UTI is intimately linked with catheterisation, the complications of catheterisation itself overlap with UTI complications [2]:

| Complication | Pathophysiology |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI)** | Biofilm formation on catheter surface; ascending infection along extraluminal or intraluminal surfaces; 3–7% per day of bacteriuria |
| **Epididymo-orchitis** | Ascending infection via vas deferens from catheter-colonised bladder |
| **Bladder stone formation** | Catheter acts as foreign body nidus; encrustation with calcium/struvite deposits |
| **Urethral stricture** | Chronic catheter-related urethral trauma → fibrosis → stricture |
| **Periurethral abscess** | Infection tracks along catheter in periurethral tissue |
| **Incontinence** | Chronic catheter → sphincter damage → incontinence after removal |
| **Bladder perforation** | Traumatic insertion or overinflated balloon |

**Long-term catheterisation problems** (from retention of urine notes) [7]:
- ***Risk of UTI/urosepsis, trauma, stones, urethral strictures, prostatitis and SCC of bladder***

#### 5.1 Post-Obstructive Diuresis (After Relief of Obstruction)

When you drain an obstructed infected kidney (e.g. insert PCN or catheter for retention), you can trigger **post-obstructive diuresis (POD)**:

***Post-obstructive diuresis: > 200 mL/h urine × ≥ 2h or > 3L urine in 24h*** [7]

***MoA: tubular damage → ↓concentrating ability → rapid fluid and solute loss*** [7]

***Significance: represents a physiological response to remove excess fluid in body (especially in CROU), but may result in fluid and electrolyte imbalance (pathological POD)*** [7]

***Ix: may have hypoNa, hypoK, hypovolaemia*** [7]

***Mx: close monitoring of I/O, fluid/electrolyte status with appropriate replacement and resuscitation (prefer oral hydration, aim to replace 1/2 of UO in the past hour)*** [7]

Other complications of acute drainage:
- ***Haemorrhage ex-vacuo (transient haematuria): bladder mucosal disruption with sudden emptying of greatly distended bladder. Usually self-limiting, rarely significant*** [7]
- ***Transient hypotension due to vagovagal response or relief of pelvic venous congestion*** [7]

---

### 6. Complications of Genitourinary TB

***Tuberculosis TB: the most common cause of infection-related death globally. 5–45% extra-pulmonary manifestations. 30 to 40% of cases involve the urogenital tract*** [1]

***GUTB: following pulmonary tuberculosis, around 2 to 20% of individuals may develop genitourinary tuberculosis after a latency of 5 to 40 years*** [1]

***GUTB: often diagnosed late with complications such as urethral or ureteric strictures, renal failure, infertility*** [1]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Ureteric strictures** | Granulomatous inflammation → fibrosis → circumferential narrowing of ureter | Obstruction → hydronephrosis → renal damage. "Corkscrew" ureter (segmental strictures and dilatation) or "pipe-stem" ureter (shortened, rigid) [4] |
| **Contracted "thimble" bladder** | Chronic TB cystitis → fibrosis → loss of bladder capacity | Severe storage LUTS (frequency up to every 15–30 minutes); functionally devastating |
| **Autonephrectomy** | Progressive caseous necrosis → dystrophic calcification → non-functioning, calcified kidney | Loss of renal function on affected side; small calcified kidney on imaging [4] |
| **Infertility** | Male: epididymal/vas deferens involvement → obstructive azoospermia. Female: fallopian tube involvement (90–100%) → tubal occlusion | Important consequence in reproductive-age patients [4] |
| **Renal failure** | Bilateral strictures, bilateral parenchymal destruction, or amyloidosis | May require dialysis/transplant |

---

### 7. UTI as a Complication of Other Conditions

UTI is itself a common complication in many clinical settings:

| Clinical Setting | Why UTI Occurs |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **Stroke** | Immobility, catheterisation, neurogenic bladder → ***UTI listed as a systemic complication of stroke*** [9] |
| **Spinal cord injury** | Neurogenic bladder → incomplete emptying → catheter dependence → recurrent UTI |
| **Post-surgical** (any major surgery) | Catheterisation, immobility, post-anaesthetic voiding difficulty → ***UTI: pathology includes catheterisation, ineffective voiding (post-anaesthesia, wound pain, posture, nerve injury)*** [5] |
| **Diabetes mellitus** | Glycosuria, autonomic neuropathy → diabetic cystopathy, immunosuppression |
| **BPH / prostate cancer** | BOO → incomplete emptying → urinary stasis |
| **Long-term catheterisation** | ***Problems: risk of UTI/urosepsis, trauma, stones, urethral strictures, prostatitis and SCC of bladder*** [7] |

| **Long-term — TB** | Strictures, contracted bladder, autonephrectomy, infertility | Granulomatous inflammation → fibrosis | Diagnosed late; requires prolonged anti-TB Rx |
| **Prostatitis-specific** | Abscess, chronic prostatitis, endocarditis | Inadequately treated acute prostatitis; haematogenous seeding | Drainage for abscess; prolonged Abx for chronic |
| **Pregnancy-specific** | Preterm delivery, low birth weight | Endotoxin/prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractions | Screen and treat ASB to prevent |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary: Complications of UTI">

**Immediate life-threatening complications:**
1. **Urosepsis** — the most feared; especially with obstruction. Manage with sepsis bundles + source control.
2. **Pyonephrosis** — pus under pressure = emergency drainage (PCN or JJ stent). Antibiotics alone are INSUFFICIENT.
3. **EPN** — gas-forming infection in DM. High mortality. Medical Mx + PCD ± nephrectomy.

**Local complications:**
4. **Renal/perinephric abscess** — insidious onset; CT for diagnosis; drain if > 3–5 cm.
5. **Prostatic abscess** — failure to defervesce despite antibiotics for prostatitis.

**Long-term complications:**
6. **Renal scarring (reflux nephropathy)** — the key paediatric complication. VUR + UTI → scarring → CKD + HTN. Prevent with prophylaxis and surgery.
7. **Struvite stones** — urease-producing organisms → alkaline urine → stone formation → perpetuates infection cycle.
8. **SCC bladder** — chronic UTI + long-term catheter ( > 10 years).
9. **GU-TB complications** — strictures, contracted bladder, autonephrectomy, infertility. Diagnosed late.

**Pregnancy complications:** Pyelonephritis (20–40% of untreated ASB), preterm delivery, low birth weight → screen and treat ASB.

**Post-drainage complications:** Post-obstructive diuresis ( > 200 mL/h), haemorrhage ex-vacuo, transient hypotension. Monitor I/O closely.
