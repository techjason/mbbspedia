# Benign Lesions of the Vocal Cord

## 1. Definition

"Benign lesions of the vocal cord" is an umbrella term for non-malignant growths or structural changes affecting the true vocal folds (and occasionally the false folds or surrounding laryngeal structures). They are overwhelmingly the most common cause of **chronic dysphonia** (voice change lasting > 3 weeks) in the absence of neurological pathology or malignancy.

The key benign lesions to know are:

1. **Vocal cord nodules** ("singer's/screamer's nodes")
2. **Vocal cord polyps**
3. **Polypoid corditis (Reinke's oedema)**
4. **Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP)**
5. (Acute laryngitis — technically a benign, self-limiting condition but covered separately)

Each has a distinct aetiology, pathology, location on the vocal fold, and management — and the exams love comparing them.

## 2. Epidemiology and Risk Factors

### 2.1 Vocal Cord Nodules

- ***Classically affects singers, teachers*** [1]
- More common in **females** and **children** — because shorter vocal folds vibrate at higher frequency, increasing mechanical stress [2]
- Prevalence: up to 17–24% of professional voice users (teachers, call-centre workers, singers)
- Risk factors:
  - ***Voice abuse*** (shouting, singing without technique, prolonged loud talking) [1]
  - Smoking (adds chemical irritation on top of mechanical trauma)
  - Gastroesophageal/laryngopharyngeal reflux (GERD/LPR)
  - Upper respiratory tract infections (superimposed oedema lowers the threshold for injury)

### 2.2 Vocal Cord Polyps

- More common in **adult males** (especially smokers) [2]
- Occurs rarely in children [2]
- Risk factors:
  - ***Acute vocal trauma*** (e.g. a single episode of shouting/screaming at a concert) [1]
  - Smoking
  - GERD/LPR
  - Muscle tension dysphonia [2]

### 2.3 Polypoid Corditis (Reinke's Oedema)

- Frequently seen in **middle-aged females** [2]
- Very strongly associated with **smoking** — almost all patients are heavy smokers
- Risk factors:
  - Smoking (most important)
  - Laryngopharyngeal reflux
  - Hypothyroidism (myxoedematous tissue deposition)
  - Vocal hyperfunctioning [2]

### 2.4 Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)

- ***Most common benign laryngeal tumour in children*** [2]
- **Juvenile-onset RRP**: typically diagnosed between age 2–3, most before age 5; mostly resolves after puberty [2]
- **Adult-onset RRP**: occurs in 30s–40s; usually less severe; more likely to involve extra-laryngeal sites of the upper aerodigestive tract [2]
- Risk factors:
  - **HPV subtypes 6 and 11** — acquired during vaginal delivery from a mother with genital condylomata [2]
  - First-born child, prolonged labour (increased contact time with infected birth canal)
  - Vaginal delivery (vs. caesarean section)

<Callout title="Hong Kong Context" type="idea">
In Hong Kong, the heavy prevalence of occupational voice use (teachers, customer service workers, hawkers in wet markets) and the high rates of GERD related to dietary habits make vocal nodules and polyps common presentations. Smoking rates, particularly in middle-aged men, drive polyp and Reinke's oedema prevalence. HPV vaccination (Gardasil 9) is increasingly available but juvenile RRP still presents, often in ENT clinics at Queen Mary or Prince of Wales Hospitals.

## 3. Anatomy and Function of the Vocal Folds

Understanding the microanatomy is essential because each benign lesion affects a **different layer**, which determines its appearance, behaviour, and treatment.

### 3.1 Gross Anatomy

The **true vocal folds** (vocal cords) are paired structures stretching from the anterior commissure (attached to the thyroid cartilage) to the vocal process of the **arytenoid cartilage** posteriorly. They are the primary vibrating structures for phonation.

- The **anterior 1/3** is the membranous (free) portion where vibration amplitude is greatest — this is the **point of maximal mechanical stress**
- The junction of the **anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3** is where nodules classically form (the point of maximal vibration amplitude during phonation) [1][2]

### 3.2 Microanatomy — The Layered Structure (Hirano's Cover-Body Model)

This is critical. The vocal fold has **5 layers**, grouped into a **cover** and a **body**:

| Layer | Structure | Properties | Relevance |
|:------|:----------|:-----------|:----------|
| 1 | **Squamous epithelium** | Thin, stiff protective layer | Nodules affect this layer [2] |
| 2 | **Superficial lamina propria (SLP)** = **Reinke's space** | Loose, gelatinous; few fibres; contains capillaries | Polyps and Reinke's oedema affect this layer [2]; this is the "vibrating jelly" |
| 3 | **Intermediate lamina propria** | Elastic fibres | Together form the **vocal ligament** |
| 4 | **Deep lamina propria** | Collagen fibres | |
| 5 | **Vocalis muscle** (thyroarytenoid) | Muscle bulk | The "body" — controls tension and bulk |

**Cover** = Epithelium + Superficial lamina propria (SLP)
**Transition** = Intermediate + Deep lamina propria (= vocal ligament)
**Body** = Vocalis muscle

> **Why does this matter?** During phonation, the **cover slides over the body** in a wave-like motion (the "mucosal wave"). Anything that stiffens or adds mass to the cover disrupts this wave, causing dysphonia. Each benign lesion disrupts a specific layer.

### 3.3 Innervation (relevant for understanding vocal cord palsy context)

- **Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN)**:
  - External branch → Cricothyroid muscle (tensor of the vocal fold — pitch control)
  - Internal branch → Sensory above the glottis
- **Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)**:
  - Motor to ALL intrinsic laryngeal muscles **except** cricothyroid
  - Sensory below the glottis
  - Left RLN has a long course (loops under the aortic arch) → more vulnerable to injury

### 3.4 Blood Supply

The **superior and inferior laryngeal arteries** (from superior and inferior thyroid arteries respectively) supply the vocal folds. The capillaries in Reinke's space are small and delicate — this is why acute vocal trauma causes haemorrhage into this layer, forming polyps [1].

## 4. Aetiology and Pathophysiology

### 4.1 Vocal Cord Nodules

**Aetiology**: ***Caused by voice abuse*** [1] — chronic, repetitive mechanical trauma to the vocal fold mucosa.

**Pathophysiology** (step-by-step, as given in the lecture slides):

> ***Vocal trauma → localised oedema → fibrosis → nodules*** [1]

Let's break this down from first principles:

1. **Vocal trauma**: During phonation, the two vocal folds adduct (come together) and vibrate against each other. Excessive force or prolonged use causes **microtrauma** at the point of maximal contact — the ***junction of the anterior 1/3 and middle 1/3 of the vocal folds*** [1][2]
2. **Localised oedema**: The repetitive collision damages epithelial cells → release of inflammatory mediators → fluid accumulation in the superficial layers. An **early nodule is oedematous** [2]
3. **Fibrosis**: If the abuse continues, the inflammatory exudate organises. Fibroblasts lay down **collagen** → the nodule becomes **thickened and fibrotic** with ongoing vocal fold microtrauma [2]
4. **Nodule formation**: The result is a discrete, firm, white/grey lesion at the epithelial level — affecting the **epithelial layer** [2]

> Why bilateral? Because both vocal folds collide against each other with equal force. The point of maximal contact is the same on both sides → ***bilateral and (always) symmetrical*** [1].

**Key associations**: Smoking, GERD, muscle tension dysphonia all amplify mucosal inflammation and lower the threshold for nodule formation [2].

### 4.2 Vocal Cord Polyps

**Aetiology**: ***Acute vocal trauma*** [1] — often a single episode of extreme voice use (e.g. screaming at a football match, forceful coughing).

**Pathophysiology** (as per lecture slides):

> ***Acute vocal trauma → bleeding from mucosal vessel → organised haematoma → polyp*** [1]

Step-by-step:

1. **Acute trauma**: A forceful, sudden adduction or collision of the vocal folds ruptures a **capillary in the superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space)** — remember, the vessels here are small and fragile
2. **Submucosal haemorrhage**: Blood extravasates into Reinke's space
3. **Organisation**: Over days to weeks, the haematoma organises — granulation tissue forms, then fibrosis
4. **Polyp formation**: The result is a fleshy, often pedunculated (stalked) or sessile mass, typically **unilateral** and located at the **mid-cord** [2]

> Why unilateral? Unlike nodules (bilateral from equal bilateral trauma), a polyp arises from a **focal vascular event** — one vessel ruptures on one side. A **contralateral smaller "contact lesion"** may develop from repeated impact of the polyp against the opposite fold [2].

The polyp **affects the superficial lamina propria** (SLP) — i.e., it is histologically ***more superficial*** in origin than nodules (which affect the epithelial layer with fibrotic thickening) [2]. This is a slightly counterintuitive point from Felix's notes — the polyp is a deeper (subepithelial, SLP) lesion in terms of tissue layer, even though Felix writes "more superficial." What this means is the polyp arises from **within** Reinke's space (SLP), whereas nodules form from **reactive epithelial thickening**.

<Callout title="Polyp vs Nodule — Must Know for Exams" type="error">
Students commonly confuse these. The key distinguishing features:
- **Nodules**: Bilateral, symmetrical, at the junction of anterior 1/3 and posterior 2/3, caused by chronic abuse, managed primarily with voice therapy
- **Polyps**: Unilateral, mid-cord, caused by acute trauma (vessel rupture), managed primarily with ***microlaryngoscopy + excision*** [1]
</Callout>

### 4.3 Polypoid Corditis (Reinke's Oedema)

**Aetiology**: Chronic irritation, overwhelmingly from **smoking** [2]. Also: LPR, hypothyroidism, vocal hyperfunctioning.

**Reinke's oedema** — let's break down the name:
- "Reinke's" = Reinke's space (superficial lamina propria)
- "Oedema" = fluid accumulation

**Pathophysiology**:

1. Chronic irritation (smoke, acid reflux) → damage to the delicate **capillaries** in Reinke's space [2]
2. Increased capillary permeability → **extravasation of fluid** (viscous, gelatinous material) into Reinke's space [2]
3. The SLP accumulates this **viscous material** → the vocal folds become **swollen and floppy** [2]
4. Findings are typically **bilateral** (because the irritant — smoke — affects both folds equally) [2]
5. The floppy, oedematous folds have **increased mass** → vibrate at a **lower fundamental frequency** → the voice drops in pitch

> This is why affected women classically present with a ***husky, low-pitched voice*** — they describe "***sounding like a man***" [2].

In severe cases, the swollen folds can obstruct the airway → **respiratory compromise** [2].

### 4.4 Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)

**Aetiology**: **HPV subtypes 6 and 11** [2] — the same low-risk subtypes that cause anogenital warts. Viral acquisition occurs during **vaginal delivery** from an infected mother [2].

**Pathophysiology**:

1. HPV infects the **squamous epithelium** of the upper aerodigestive tract, with a predilection for **squamocolumnar junctions** (areas where squamous epithelium meets respiratory/columnar epithelium)
2. The virus integrates into the basal epithelial cells → drives **epithelial proliferation** → formation of exophytic, papillomatous (finger-like) growths with fibrovascular cores
3. The **larynx** is the most commonly involved site [2] — specifically the vocal folds, ventricles, and subglottis
4. In children, the small airway calibre means even modest papilloma growth causes significant obstruction
5. The virus persists in a latent state in adjacent "normal" mucosa → explains the **high recurrence rate** even after excision [2]

> ***No cure for the disease*** — surgery has an ongoing role of **palliation** [2]. Most children with RRP require **multiple surgical treatments** before puberty, and the natural history is **eventual recurrence** [2].

**HPV 11** is associated with a **more aggressive** course and greater risk of **distal spread** (tracheobronchial involvement) and, rarely, **malignant transformation** to squamous cell carcinoma.

<Callout title="Juvenile vs Adult-Onset RRP">
- **Juvenile**: More aggressive, often requires many surgeries, tends to resolve after puberty (hormonal/immune maturation?)
- **Adult**: Less severe, more likely to involve extra-laryngeal sites, does NOT resolve spontaneously [2]
</Callout>

## 5. Classification

### 5.1 By Lesion Type

| Lesion | Nature | Layer Affected | Laterality | Classic Location | Classic Patient |
|:-------|:-------|:---------------|:-----------|:-----------------|:----------------|
| **Nodules** | Fibrotic thickening | Epithelial layer [2] | ***Bilateral, always symmetrical*** [1] | ***Junction of anterior 1/3 and middle 1/3*** [1] | Female singer/teacher |
| **Polyp** | Organised haematoma | Superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) [2] | ***Unilateral*** [1] | Mid-cord [2] | Adult male, smoker |
| **Reinke's oedema** | Fluid accumulation in SLP | Superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) [2] | Bilateral | Diffuse along entire vocal fold | Middle-aged female smoker |
| **RRP** | HPV-driven papilloma | Squamous epithelium | Variable (often bilateral, multifocal) | Vocal folds, ventricles, subglottis | Child age 2–5 |

### 5.2 By Aetiology

**Organic benign lesions** (from the lecture etiologies of voice disorders) [1]:
- ***Acute laryngitis***
- ***Vocal cord nodules***
- ***Vocal cord polyp***
- ***Reinke's oedema***
- ***Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis***

These are contrasted against:
- ***Malignant***: Squamous cell carcinoma [1]
- ***Neurological***: Central (Parkinsonism, vocal tremor, spasmodic dysphonia) or Peripheral (RLN palsy, SLN palsy) [1]
- ***Functional***: e.g. muscle tension dysphonia [1]
- ***Psychogenic***: e.g. conversion disorder [1]

### 5.3 RRP Classification

- **Juvenile-onset**: Age < 12 at diagnosis (typically 2–5)
- **Adult-onset**: Age > 12 (typically 30s–40s)
- Severity scored by the **Derkay staging system** (scoring extent and sites of papillomata)

## 6. Clinical Features

### 6.1 Symptoms

#### A. Vocal Cord Nodules

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--------|:------------------------|
| **Hoarseness** (early) / mild raspiness and roughness of voice [2] | The bilateral nodules add mass to the vibrating edge → irregular vibration → rough quality |
| ***Husky voice*** [1] | Increased mass of the vocal fold cover → lower fundamental frequency and turbulent airflow |
| ***Easy fatigue of voice*** [1] | The nodules prevent efficient glottic closure → the patient compensates with increased muscular effort → vocal fatigue |
| **Breathiness** (with large lesions) [2] | Large nodules cause **incomplete closure of the vocal folds** → air leaks through the glottic gap during phonation → breathy quality [2] |
| ***Air leak*** [1] | Same mechanism — incomplete glottic closure during the closed phase of vibration |
| Voice breaks / pitch instability | The fibrotic nodule stiffens the mucosal wave → unpredictable vibration → voice "cracking" |

#### B. Vocal Cord Polyps

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--------|:------------------------|
| **Hoarseness** [2] | The polyp adds asymmetric mass to one vocal fold → irregular, asymmetric vibration |
| **Diplophonia** (two different voice tones simultaneously) [2] | The two vocal folds now have different masses and therefore vibrate at different frequencies — producing two simultaneous pitches. This is relatively specific to unilateral lesions |
| **Raspiness and breathiness** [2] | The polyp prevents smooth adduction → irregular vocal fold edge → turbulent airflow |
| ***Husky voice and easy fatigue due to air leak*** [1] | Same mechanism as nodules — incomplete glottic closure |
| Sudden voice change | Onset may be acute (after the causative vocal trauma event) rather than gradual |

<Callout title="Diplophonia = Think Unilateral Lesion">
Diplophonia ("diplo" = double, "phonia" = voice) — hearing two pitches simultaneously — is a hallmark of **asymmetric vocal fold mass**. If you hear this on history, think unilateral polyp (or unilateral vocal cord palsy).
</Callout>

#### C. Polypoid Corditis (Reinke's Oedema)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--------|:------------------------|
| ***Husky, low-pitched voice*** [2] | Bilateral oedema increases the total mass of both vocal folds → both vibrate at a lower frequency → the fundamental frequency drops. In females, this produces a characteristically deep, "masculine" voice |
| ***"Sounding like a man"*** (in females) [2] | Same — the pitch drops into the male range |
| **Chronic throat clearing** | The floppy, oedematous tissue creates a sensation of a foreign body in the throat → habitual clearing (which itself worsens the condition) |
| ***Respiratory compromise*** (severe cases) [2] | Severely oedematous, floppy vocal folds can prolapse into the airway during inspiration → stridor and dyspnoea |

#### D. Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|:--------|:------------------------|
| ***Hoarseness*** [2] | Papillomata on the vocal fold surface disrupt the smooth mucosal wave → irregular vibration |
| ***Breathiness*** [2] | Bulky papillomata prevent complete glottic closure → air leak |
| ***Respiratory distress*** [2] | In children, the small airway is easily obstructed by exophytic papillomata → stridor (inspiratory if supraglottic/glottic, biphasic if subglottic) → dyspnoea |
| Weak cry / altered cry (in infants) | Papillomata on the vocal folds change their vibratory characteristics |
| Chronic cough | Mucosal irritation by the growths |

<Callout title="Red Flag in a Child with Progressive Hoarseness" type="error">
A toddler (age 2–5) presenting with progressive hoarseness, stridor, and respiratory distress should raise alarm for **RRP** — the ***most common benign laryngeal tumour in children*** [2]. Do NOT dismiss hoarseness in a young child as "just a sore throat." It warrants laryngoscopy.
</Callout>

### 6.2 Signs

#### A. General Examination

- **Voice quality**: Assess during the consultation — hoarse, breathy, rough, strained, low-pitched?
- **Stridor**: Particularly in RRP (children) or severe Reinke's oedema
- **Neck**: No lymphadenopathy expected (benign lesions); if palpable nodes → think malignancy

#### B. Laryngoscopy Findings (the definitive examination)

This is performed by **flexible nasolaryngoscopy** (FNL) in clinic or **microlaryngoscopy** (under GA) for detailed assessment and intervention.

| Lesion | Laryngoscopy Appearance |
|:-------|:------------------------|
| **Nodules** | ***Bilateral, symmetrical*** small white/grey, well-defined elevations at the ***junction of the anterior 1/3 and middle 1/3*** of the vocal folds [1][2]. Early nodules are soft and oedematous; chronic nodules are firm and fibrotic |
| **Polyp** | ***Unilateral***, fleshy, often pedunculated (on a stalk) or sessile mass at **mid-cord** [1][2]. May be haemorrhagic (red) if recent, or pale/translucent if long-standing. May see a contralateral "contact lesion" [2] |
| **Reinke's oedema** | Bilateral, diffuse, **boggy/gelatinous swelling** of the entire vocal fold. The folds appear **swollen and floppy** [2], with a characteristic "water balloon" or "sausage-like" appearance. Mucosal wave may be exaggerated |
| **RRP** | Multiple, **exophytic, raspberry-like or cauliflower-like papillomatous growths**, often clustered. May be on vocal folds, ventricles, subglottis, epiglottis. **Multifocal** involvement is common |

#### C. Stroboscopy Findings

**Videostroboscopy** uses flashing light synchronised to the vocal fold vibration frequency to visualise the **mucosal wave** in "slow motion." This is crucial for differentiating benign from malignant lesions:

| Lesion | Stroboscopy Finding | Explanation |
|:-------|:--------------------|:------------|
| Nodules | Reduced mucosal wave at the nodule site; hourglass-shaped glottic closure pattern | Fibrotic tissue is stiff → impedes the mucosal wave; the nodules act as "bumps" that prevent full closure except at those points |
| Polyp | Asymmetric vibration; aperiodic motion | Unilateral mass causes one fold to vibrate differently from the other |
| Reinke's oedema | Exaggerated, floppy mucosal wave | The fluid-filled SLP is extremely compliant → the wave is large and disorganised |
| Malignancy (for comparison) | **Absent** mucosal wave | Tumour infiltrates and stiffens the SLP → no wave. This is the key distinguishing finding from benign lesions |

<Callout title="Stroboscopy: Benign vs Malignant" type="idea">
The **mucosal wave** is your friend. Benign lesions may alter or exaggerate the wave but it is **present**. Malignant lesions **obliterate** the mucosal wave because tumour infiltration stiffens Reinke's space. An absent mucosal wave on stroboscopy should prompt urgent biopsy.
</Callout>

#### D. Accompanying Findings

- Vocal cord nodules and polyps can be accompanied by **haematoma, haemorrhage, or vascular varices** [2] — evidence of ongoing mucosal trauma
- In RRP, look for extension to **extra-laryngeal sites**: oropharynx, trachea, bronchi (especially in adult-onset RRP) [2]

## 7. Summary Comparison Table

| Feature | Nodules | Polyp | Reinke's Oedema | RRP |
|:--------|:--------|:------|:-----------------|:----|
| **Aetiology** | ***Chronic voice abuse*** [1] | ***Acute vocal trauma*** [1] | Smoking, LPR, hypothyroidism | HPV 6, 11 [2] |
| **Pathophysiology** | ***Vocal trauma → oedema → fibrosis*** [1] | ***Trauma → vessel bleeding → organised haematoma*** [1] | Capillary injury → fluid extravasation into Reinke's space [2] | HPV → epithelial proliferation |
| **Layer affected** | Epithelial [2] | Superficial lamina propria [2] | Superficial lamina propria [2] | Squamous epithelium |
| **Laterality** | ***Bilateral, symmetrical*** [1] | ***Unilateral*** [1] | Bilateral [2] | Variable, multifocal |
| **Location** | ***Junction ant 1/3 & mid 1/3*** [1] | Mid-cord [2] | Diffuse, entire fold | Vocal folds, ventricles, subglottis |
| **Classic patient** | Female singer/teacher | Adult male | Middle-aged female smoker | Child 2–5 years |
| **Voice change** | Husky, breathy [1] | Hoarse, diplophonia [2] | ***Low-pitched, husky ("like a man")*** [2] | Hoarseness, weak cry |
| **Management** | ***Speech therapy, vocal hygiene*** [1] | ***Microlaryngoscopy + excision*** [1] | Stop smoking, surgery if needed | ***Microlaryngeal surgery*** (palliative, recurring) [2] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Must-know points for exams:**

1. ***Vocal cord nodules***: Bilateral, symmetrical, at junction of anterior 1/3 and middle 1/3 of vocal folds. Caused by chronic voice abuse. Pathophysiology: vocal trauma → oedema → fibrosis → nodules [1]. Management: speech therapy and vocal hygiene (conservative first) [1].

2. ***Vocal cord polyps***: Unilateral, mid-cord. Caused by acute vocal trauma. Pathophysiology: acute trauma → mucosal vessel bleeding → organised haematoma → polyp [1]. Management: microlaryngoscopy + excision [1].

3. ***Reinke's oedema***: Bilateral, diffuse swelling of vocal folds. Strongly associated with smoking. Viscous material accumulates in superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) [2]. Classic presentation: middle-aged female smoker with husky, low-pitched voice ("sounding like a man") [2].

4. ***RRP***: Most common benign laryngeal tumour in children [2]. Caused by HPV 6 and 11 acquired during vaginal delivery. No cure; surgery is palliative with eventual recurrence [2].

5. **Mucosal wave on stroboscopy**: Present (though altered) in benign lesions; ABSENT in malignancy. This is the key differentiator.

6. **Diplophonia** = two simultaneous voice tones = think **unilateral** lesion (polyp or unilateral vocal cord palsy) [2].

7. Know the **microanatomy**: Epithelium → SLP (Reinke's space) → intermediate LP → deep LP → vocalis muscle. Nodules = epithelial; polyps and Reinke's oedema = SLP [2].
