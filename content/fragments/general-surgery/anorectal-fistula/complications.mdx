## Complications of Anorectal Fistula

Complications can be divided into two broad categories: **complications of the disease itself** (untreated or inadequately treated fistula) and **complications of surgical treatment**. Understanding both is essential because the management of fistula is essentially a balancing act — you're always weighing the risks of leaving the disease untreated against the risks of the surgery intended to fix it.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1. Recurrent Anorectal Abscess

**Mechanism**: The fistula maintains a persistent communication between the anal canal lumen (via the internal opening at the infected crypt) and the perianal tissues. Faecal bacteria continuously seed the tract → intermittent accumulation of pus → **cyclical abscess formation** [2][3].

- This is the most common complication of an untreated fistula.
- Each recurrence can extend the septic process into new tissue planes → the fistula becomes progressively more complex (new secondary tracts, horseshoe extensions).
- ***Can expand into adjacent tissues including ischiorectal and supralevator space or even progress into generalised systemic infection*** [2].

**Why does this matter?** Each cycle of abscess → drainage → recurrence creates more **scarring and fibrosis** around the sphincter complex, making eventual definitive surgery more difficult and increasing the risk of incontinence from the surgery itself.

---

#### 2. Complex Fistula Formation / Branching

**Mechanism**: Undrained or inadequately drained sepsis tracks along paths of least resistance through perianal/perirectal tissue planes. Over time:
- A simple intersphincteric fistula can extend through the EAS → becomes **transsphincteric**.
- Pus can track through the deep postanal space (behind the anal canal) from one ischiorectal fossa to the other → **horseshoe fistula**.
- Multiple secondary tracts develop → **complex fistula with multiple external openings**.

The more complex the fistula becomes, the harder it is to treat surgically without damaging the sphincter, and the higher the recurrence rate.

---

#### 3. Perianal Sepsis and Systemic Infection

**Mechanism**: If the external opening blocks and there is no adequate drainage path, pus accumulates under pressure. This can progress to:
- **Cellulitis** of the perianal skin and perineum.
- **Necrotising fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's gangrene)** — a life-threatening surgical emergency. Polymicrobial infection spreads rapidly through subcutaneous tissues and fascial planes. Particularly dangerous in **immunocompromised patients** (diabetes, HIV, on immunosuppressants) and those with perianal Crohn's disease.
- **Bacteraemia / sepsis** — the perianal region is richly vascular; uncontrolled infection can seed the bloodstream.

<Callout title="Fournier's Gangrene — Lethal Complication" type="error">
Any patient with an anorectal abscess or fistula who develops rapidly spreading perineal erythema, crepitus (subcutaneous gas), necrotic skin, systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, hypotension), or disproportionate pain should be suspected of having **Fournier's gangrene**. This requires **emergency surgical debridement** + broad-spectrum IV antibiotics + ICU support. Mortality is 20–40% even with treatment.
</Callout>

---

#### 4. Chronic Perianal Skin Changes

**Mechanism**: Persistent discharge from the external opening causes:
- **Chronic dermatitis and maceration** of the perianal skin — from continuous moisture and irritant contact with pus/faecal material.
- **Pruritus ani** — secondary to chronic skin inflammation and excoriation [2].
- **Scarring and fibrosis** — repeated cycles of inflammation and healing lead to thickened, indurated perianal skin.

---

#### 5. Malignant Transformation (Rare but Important)

**Mechanism**: Chronic inflammation over many years (typically > 10 years of untreated fistula) can lead to **squamous cell carcinoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma** arising in the fistula tract. This is analogous to other chronic inflammatory conditions that predispose to malignancy (e.g., Marjolin's ulcer in chronic wounds, cholangiocarcinoma in PSC).

- Extremely rare but well-documented in case reports.
- Should be suspected in any **long-standing fistula that suddenly changes character** — increased pain, harder tissue, bloody rather than purulent discharge, rapid growth.
- **Always send fistula tract curettings for histology** at the time of surgery to exclude occult malignancy.

---

#### 6. Complications Specific to Crohn's-Associated Fistulae

Crohn's perianal fistulae carry additional disease-specific complications due to the transmural inflammatory nature of the underlying disease [12][8]:

- ***Fistula formation*** (additional types beyond perianal) [12]:
  - ***Enteroenteric fistula → palpable mass*** [12]
  - ***Enterovesical fistula → urinary symptoms due to UTI*** (pneumaturia = air in urine, faecaluria = faeces in urine) [12][13]
  - ***Enterovaginal fistula → passage of gas or faeces through vagina*** [12][13]
  - ***Enterocutaneous fistula → drainage of bowel contents to surface of skin*** [12][13]
  - ***Retroperitoneal fistula → psoas abscess or ureteral obstruction with hydronephrosis*** [12]
- ***Abscess formation*** — sinus tracts may lead to abscess → acute localised peritonitis with fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness → perforation can lead to diffuse peritonitis [12].
- ***Perianal disease*** — formation of skin tags, anal fissures, perirectal abscess, and anorectal fistulas [12]. ***83% of perianal Crohn's patients required surgery*** [8].
- **Anal stenosis / stricture** — chronic fibrosis from repeated inflammation narrows the anal canal.

### B. Complications of Surgical Treatment

This is where the exam loves to test you — the complications of each surgical procedure and **why** they occur.

#### 1. Faecal Incontinence

This is the **most feared complication** of fistula surgery and the primary reason complex fistulae require sphincter-sparing approaches rather than fistulotomy.

***Risk of incontinence should be informed*** before any fistula surgery [1].

**Mechanism**: Division of the anal sphincter muscle during surgery → loss of the sphincter's ability to maintain closure → involuntary leakage of gas, liquid stool, or solid stool.

| Procedure | Incontinence Risk | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| **Fistulotomy for simple fistula** | Low (~0–10%) | Only a small amount of IAS and/or superficial EAS is divided for low fistulae |
| **Fistulotomy for complex fistula** | HIGH (contraindicated) | Would require dividing > 30% of EAS → significant loss of voluntary squeeze pressure |
| **Cutting seton** | Moderate (~10–20%) | Gradually divides the sphincter — fibrosis forms behind, but the degree of continence preservation is unpredictable |
| **LIFT** | Low (~0–5%) | No sphincter is divided; dissection is in the intersphincteric plane |
| **Advancement flap** | Low (~5–10%) | Sphincter not divided, but mobilisation of the flap may cause minor IAS injury |

**Risk factors for incontinence** after fistula surgery:
- **Pre-existing sphincter damage** (previous obstetric injury, prior fistula surgery, prior lateral internal sphincterotomy for fissure).
- **Female sex** — thinner, shorter anterior sphincter.
- **Anterior fistula in women** — even a small division of the anterior EAS can cause incontinence.
- **Recurrent fistula surgery** — each operation removes more sphincter tissue; cumulative damage.
- **Older age** — reduced baseline sphincter tone due to age-related muscle atrophy and pudendal neuropathy.

<Callout title="The Cumulative Sphincter Damage Problem" type="error">
Each fistula operation takes a bit more sphincter. A patient who has had three fistulotomies may have no functioning EAS left. This is why the **initial operation** must be done correctly — identify the tract anatomy precisely, choose the right procedure, and avoid unnecessary sphincter division. Getting it wrong the first time starts a cascade of increasingly difficult re-operations.
</Callout>

#### 2. Recurrence

This is the second most common complication. Recurrence rates vary significantly by procedure:

| Procedure | Recurrence Rate | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| **Fistulotomy** | ~2–8% | Low because the entire tract is laid open and the internal opening is curetted. Recurrence usually due to missed internal opening or unidentified secondary tract. |
| **Advancement flap** | ~20–40% | Flap may fail to adhere or internal opening may not be completely obliterated. Higher in active Crohn's/proctitis. |
| **LIFT** | ~25–40% | The ligated intersphincteric portion may reopen; the external component may persist. |
| **Fistula plug** | ~40–70% | High plug extrusion rate → tract reopens. |
| **Fibrin sealant** | ~60–85% | Sealant often reabsorbed before the tract heals. |
| **Cutting seton** | ~5–15% | Low because the tract is progressively destroyed. |

**Common reasons for recurrence**:
1. **Failure to identify the internal opening** — if the cryptoglandular source is not addressed, the infection cycle restarts. ***The most critical step is to identify and curette the internal opening*** [2].
2. **Missed secondary tracts** — undrained extensions continue to harbour infection. This is why MRI is essential for complex fistulae.
3. **Inadequate drainage of associated abscess** — residual sepsis prevents healing.
4. **Underlying Crohn's disease** not treated medically — ongoing transmural inflammation drives recurrence regardless of surgical technique. ***More complicated courses of fistula tract*** in Crohn's [8].
5. **Creation of false passage** during probing → new iatrogenic tract that is not addressed.

---

#### 3. Sphincter Injury (Without Overt Incontinence)

***Complications: sphincter injury*** [3].

Even when patients do not report overt incontinence, fistula surgery can cause subclinical sphincter damage detectable on endoanal ultrasound or anorectal manometry. This may only become clinically significant later in life when age-related sphincter degeneration further reduces continence reserves.

---

#### 4. Wound-Related Complications

Fistulotomy wounds heal by **secondary intention** (from the base up, without primary closure). This creates specific wound-related issues:

- **Delayed wound healing**: Fistulotomy wounds in the perianal region take **6–12 weeks** to heal fully. The perineum is a moist, contaminated environment (faecal bacteria, constant movement from sitting/walking), which slows healing.
- **Wound infection**: Despite the wound being intentionally left open, secondary bacterial overgrowth can cause wound cellulitis or a new abscess.
- **Bleeding**: Minor postoperative bleeding from the granulating wound bed is common. Significant bleeding (reactionary or secondary) is uncommon but may require return to theatre for haemostasis.
- **Anal stenosis / stricture**: Excessive fibrosis during wound healing can narrow the anal canal → difficulty with defecation, thin stools, straining. More common with extensive fistulotomy (large wound) or circumferential wounds. May require **finger or endoscopic balloon dilatation** [14].

---

#### 5. False Passage Creation

**Mechanism**: During EUA, if the fistula probe is forced through the tract wall rather than following the true tract, a **new iatrogenic passage** is created through tissue that was previously uninvolved [2].

- ***Performed with caution to avoid creating a false passage by penetrating the fistula wall*** [2].
- This can convert a simple fistula into a complex one, or create a new fistula in addition to the original one.
- Avoided by: gentle probing, using a malleable (not rigid) probe, never forcing the probe.

---

#### 6. Complications Specific to Certain Procedures

| Procedure | Specific Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Cutting seton** | Pain at each tightening; chronic perianal discomfort | The seton is physically cutting through tissue — generates inflammation and pain |
| **Advancement flap** | Flap dehiscence/necrosis | Inadequate blood supply to the flap; tension on suture line; active proctitis (especially Crohn's) |
| **LIFT** | Intersphincteric abscess | Ligation may trap bacteria in the intersphincteric space if the tract is not adequately debrided |
| **Fistula plug** | Plug extrusion/dislodgement | The plug is a foreign body — can be extruded by peristalsis, defecation, or rejection response |
| **Seton (loose, draining)** | Discomfort, mucoid discharge, perianal irritation | Foreign body in the tract causes chronic low-grade inflammation; discharge along the seton |
| **Faecal diversion (stoma)** | All standard stoma complications | See below |

---

#### 7. Stoma-Related Complications (When Faecal Diversion Is Required)

For extrasphincteric fistulae (Type IV), refractory Crohn's perianal disease, or salvage procedures, a **defunctioning stoma** may be created. This carries its own set of complications [2][14]:

**Early ( < 30 days)**:
- Stomal bleeding
- Stomal necrosis (ischaemia of the bowel stoma — appears dark/dusky)
- Stomal retraction (stoma sinks below skin level → appliance leakage)
- Mucocutaneous separation (dehiscence of the stoma-skin junction)
- Skin irritation and dermatitis (especially ileostomy — high-output alkaline enzymatic effluent is highly corrosive to skin)

**Late ( > 30 days)**:
- Parastomal hernia (bowel herniates through the fascial defect around the stoma)
- Stomal prolapse
- Stomal stenosis

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Untreated fistula** complications: recurrent abscess, complex fistula formation, perianal sepsis (Fournier's gangrene — emergency!), chronic skin changes, and rare malignant transformation.
2. ***Faecal incontinence*** is the **most feared surgical complication** — ***risk of incontinence should be informed*** before any fistula operation. Risk increases with: pre-existing sphincter damage, female sex, anterior fistula in women, recurrent surgery, older age.
3. **Recurrence** is the second most common complication. The **most critical step to prevent recurrence is identifying and curetting the internal opening** at surgery.
4. Common reasons for recurrence: missed internal opening, missed secondary tracts, inadequate sepsis drainage, untreated underlying Crohn's, iatrogenic false passage.
5. ***Sphincter injury*** is a recognised complication of fistulotomy.
6. **Crohn's perianal fistulae** carry additional risks: multiple fistula types (enterovesical → pneumaturia; enterovaginal → passage of gas/faeces per vagina; enterocutaneous → bowel content drainage to skin), abscess, peritonitis, anal stenosis.
7. **False passage** creation during probing is preventable — always probe gently under anaesthesia, never force.
