## Diagnosis of Anorectal Fistula

### Diagnostic Principles

Before diving into individual investigations, understand the **three goals of diagnosing a fistula** — every investigation you order serves one of these purposes [1]:

1. ***Define the anatomy of the pathological process*** — where is the internal opening, external opening, primary tract, and any secondary extensions? What is the relationship to the sphincter complex? (This determines Parks classification → determines surgery.)
2. ***Help in the diagnosis and assess the severity of disease*** — is this simple or complex? Is there active sepsis?
3. ***Exclude diseases in the proximal bowel and associated bowel problems (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease)*** — is there an underlying cause like Crohn's, TB, or malignancy? [1]

<Callout title="No Formal 'Diagnostic Criteria'">
Unlike many medical conditions, anorectal fistula does not have formal diagnostic criteria akin to the Jones criteria or McDonald criteria. The diagnosis is **clinical** — based on history, examination, and confirmed by imaging/EUA. The "criteria" are essentially: (1) compatible history, (2) identifiable external opening, (3) demonstrable internal opening and tract connecting the two. The real diagnostic challenge is **classifying** the fistula accurately to plan surgery.

### Investigation Modalities

#### 1. Clinical Examination (The Foundation)

Anorectal fistula is **primarily a clinical diagnosis** [1]. ***Clinical examination*** is the first and most important step [1].

##### a. History

***Approach to anorectal diseases*** requires a focused history [1]:
- ***Present illness***: ***anorectal symptoms — pain, bleeding, mass, prolapse*** [1]. For fistula specifically: intermittent perianal discharge, cyclical pain (worse when blocked, better when drains), recurrent abscess at the same site.
- ***Past health***: ***medical diseases, previous surgery*** [1] — prior anorectal abscess drainage? Previous fistula surgery? IBD? TB? Radiation?
- ***Family history*** [1] — IBD.
- ***Sexual history*** [1] — LGV, HIV, HPV (anal carcinoma).

##### b. External Inspection

- ***External opening*** visible on perianal skin [1][2]:
  - Typically a small **dimpled area of granulation tissue** that drains pus or blood on **manual compression** [2].
  - **Pustule-like lesion** in perianal or buttock area [2].
  - **Perianal skin is excoriated and inflamed** from chronic discharge [2].
- Count the number of external openings — multiple openings suggest complex fistula or Crohn's disease.
- Note the **position** of the external opening relative to the anus → apply ***Goodsall's rule*** [3]:
  - Anterior to transverse anal line → straight radial tract.
  - Posterior to transverse anal line → curved tract to posterior midline.
  - ***Higher reliability if external opening within 3 cm of anal verge*** [3].

<Callout title="Do NOT Probe in Clinic!" type="error">
On initial outpatient examination, ***do NOT probe*** the fistula [3]. Blind probing in the clinic without anaesthesia risks creating a **false passage** and causing pain. Probing is done under anaesthesia during ***EUA*** [2][3].
</Callout>

##### c. Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)

- ***PR: induration with cord-like structure*** [1] — the fistula tract is palpable as a firm, cord-like subcutaneous structure running from the external opening towards the anal canal.
- May feel a **pit or area of induration** at the dentate line corresponding to the internal opening.
- Assess **sphincter tone** (resting and squeeze) — baseline continence assessment before surgery is critical.
- Feel for any **abscess** (fluctuance, tenderness) or **mass** (hard, irregular = malignancy).

##### d. Proctoscopy / Sigmoidoscopy

- ***Internal opening in the anus can be viewed with anoscopy*** [2].
- ***Internal opening in the rectum can be viewed with sigmoidoscopy*** [2].
- May see pus exuding from the internal opening.
- Also assesses for concurrent pathology (haemorrhoids, fissure, rectal mucosal changes suggesting Crohn's or malignancy).

---

#### 2. Imaging Studies

***Imaging studies are usually not necessary*** for straightforward simple fistulae [1]. However, they are essential in specific scenarios.

##### a. MRI Pelvis (Gold Standard Imaging)

***MRI*** is the ***accurate technique for evaluation of the primary track of fistula and any extensions*** [1].

**When to order MRI** [1]:
- ***Complicated high fistula***
- ***Recurrent fistula***
- ***When anatomy is not obvious***

***MRI and EAUS are necessary to document before definitive treatment*** in perianal Crohn's disease [8].

| MRI Sequence | What It Shows | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| **T2-weighted (with fat suppression)** | Fluid-filled tracts appear **bright/hyperintense** against dark fat | Demonstrates active tracts and secondary extensions filled with fluid/pus |
| **T1-weighted post-gadolinium** | Enhancing granulation tissue lining the tract wall | Differentiates active inflammation (enhancing) from fibrotic/healed tracts (non-enhancing) |
| **STIR sequences** | Suppresses fat signal, highlights oedema and fluid | Excellent for detecting abscesses (bright collections) and inflamed tracts |

**Key MRI findings and interpretation:**

- **Primary fistula tract**: linear hyperintense tract on T2W connecting internal and external openings. Classify its relationship to EAS → Parks type.
- **Secondary extensions/branches**: additional tracts branching from the primary tract (e.g., horseshoe extension in the ischiorectal fossa or supralevator space).
- **Abscess**: well-defined fluid collection with enhancing rim post-gadolinium. Must be drained before definitive fistula surgery.
- **Internal opening**: identified as a defect in the IAS at the level of the dentate line, often with surrounding inflammation.
- **Sphincter integrity**: assess IAS and EAS for defects (from prior surgery or obstetric injury) — affects surgical planning.

**St James's University Hospital MRI Classification** (widely used):

| Grade | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Simple linear intersphincteric fistula |
| 2 | Intersphincteric fistula with intersphincteric abscess or secondary tract |
| 3 | Transsphincteric fistula |
| 4 | Transsphincteric fistula with abscess or secondary tract in ischiorectal fossa |
| 5 | Supralevator or translevator disease |

> Higher grade = more complex = higher recurrence risk, needs sphincter-sparing surgery.

<Callout title="MRI is King for Complex Fistulae">
If you remember one investigation for complex fistula, it's **MRI pelvis**. It has ~90% accuracy for classifying fistula anatomy and detecting secondary extensions that might be missed on clinical examination alone. It has largely replaced fistulography in modern practice.
</Callout>

##### b. Endoanal Ultrasound (EAUS / Transrectal Ultrasound)

***Transrectal ultrasound*** can be used to ***assess complex fistula*** [1] and ***assess the sphincter muscles in patients with faecal incontinence*** [1].

- **Technique**: High-frequency (7–16 MHz) rotating endoprobe inserted into the anal canal.
- ***Instilling H₂O₂ (hydrogen peroxide) via the external opening*** improves visualisation of the fistula tract — the microbubbles appear hyperechoic (bright) on ultrasound [3].

| Finding | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| **Hypoechoic tract** between IAS and EAS | Intersphincteric fistula |
| **Hypoechoic tract crossing EAS** | Transsphincteric fistula |
| **Hypoechoic collection** | Abscess |
| **Sphincter defect** | Prior sphincter injury — affects surgical planning |
| **Hyperechoic tract after H₂O₂** | Tract enhancement confirming fistula course |

**Advantages**: No radiation, real-time imaging, good sphincter assessment, bedside availability.
**Limitations**: Operator-dependent, limited field of view (cannot see supralevator disease as well as MRI), uncomfortable without anaesthesia.

**MRI vs EAUS**: Both have similar accuracy for classifying primary tracts (~85–90%). MRI is superior for detecting **secondary extensions and supralevator disease**. In practice, MRI is preferred for complex fistulae; EAUS is a good alternative if MRI is unavailable or for sphincter assessment.

##### c. Fistulography [1][2]

***Fistulogram*** [1] — injection of water-soluble contrast through the external opening followed by radiographs.

- **Largely superseded** by MRI and EAUS in modern practice.
- Can demonstrate the tract, but has poor sensitivity for secondary extensions and does not show the relationship to sphincter muscles well.
- May have a role when MRI/EAUS are unavailable.

##### d. CT Scan

- Less useful than MRI for fistula tract delineation (poorer soft-tissue contrast).
- Main role: ***CT/MRI scan indicated in a non-palpable abscess*** [5] — particularly useful for detecting **deep abscesses** (supralevator, ischiorectal) that are not clinically apparent.
- CT abdomen/pelvis may also be used to assess for **Crohn's disease** complications (strictures, other fistulae).

---

#### 3. Examination Under Anaesthesia (EUA) — The Definitive Assessment

***Examination under anesthesia (EUA)*** is ***required before surgery to trace the fistula tract*** [3]. This is the most important investigation because it combines diagnostic confirmation with therapeutic planning — and is often performed immediately before definitive surgery.

**What happens during EUA:**

1. **Visual inspection** of perianal area (external opening, scarring, Crohn's features).
2. **DRE** with relaxed sphincter — assess internal opening, induration, sphincter integrity.
3. **Proctoscopy** — identify internal opening (may see pus draining from a crypt at the dentate line).
4. **Fistula probing** [2]:
   - A **fistula probe** (malleable metal probe) is gently inserted into the external opening and passed along the tract towards the internal opening.
   - ***Determine whether the fistula is simple or complex based on the extent of anal sphincter muscle involvement*** [2].
   - ***Performed with caution to avoid creating a false passage by penetrating the fistula wall*** [2].
5. **Injection of hydrogen peroxide or methylene blue** through external opening — helps visualise the internal opening (dye emerges at the crypt).
6. **Assessment of sphincter bulk** around the tract — the surgeon palpates how much muscle lies between the probe and the skin to decide if fistulotomy is safe.

<Callout title="The Surgeon's Dilemma at EUA">
At EUA, the surgeon must answer: **"Can I safely lay this open (fistulotomy) without causing incontinence?"** If the probe shows the tract passes through > 30% of the EAS, or if the patient has poor baseline tone, or if this is a complex/recurrent fistula — the answer is no, and a **sphincter-sparing approach** (seton, advancement flap, LIFT) is needed instead.
</Callout>

#### 4. Investigations to Exclude Underlying Causes

These are not for diagnosing the fistula per se but for answering **"Why does this patient have a fistula?"** — essential in atypical cases.

##### a. Colonoscopy [3][8]

- **Indication**: ***Colonoscopy if suspect Crohn's disease*** [3].
- Any patient with **complex, recurrent, multiple, or atypical fistulae** should have a colonoscopy.
- Look for: skip lesions, cobblestoning, aphthous ulcers, non-caseating granulomata on biopsy.
- ***24.5% of patients with Crohn's disease*** have perianal involvement [8]; sometimes perianal disease is the **first** manifestation.

##### b. Histology / Biopsy

- Tissue from the fistula tract (curettings from EUA) should be sent for histology.
- **Granulomata**: if found, must differentiate Crohn's (non-caseating) from TB (caseating). ***Must exclude TB*** — especially in Hong Kong [2].
- **Dysplasia/malignancy**: biopsy any hard, irregular, or suspicious tissue.
- **Actinomycosis**: "sulphur granules" on histology.

##### c. TB Workup

- CXR, sputum AFB (if pulmonary involvement suspected).
- Tissue AFB staining and TB culture from fistula curettings.
- Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) / Mantoux test.
- Important in Hong Kong (TB is endemic).

##### d. Blood Tests (Supportive)

| Test | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **FBC** | Raised WCC suggests active sepsis; anaemia in Crohn's |
| **CRP / ESR** | Inflammatory markers — elevated in active sepsis, Crohn's |
| **Albumin** | Low in chronic Crohn's (malnutrition) |
| **LFT** | Baseline; PSC screen in Crohn's/UC |

##### e. Pus Culture and Sensitivity [4]

- After abscess drainage: pus for **C/ST** (culture and sensitivity testing).
- **Gut flora** (E. coli, Bacteroides) → communication with anal canal lumen → **likely fistula** → arrange follow-up [4].
- **Skin flora** (Staphylococcus) → superficial infection → **unlikely fistula** → reassurance [4].

### Summary: Which Investigation and When?

| Scenario | Investigations |
|---|---|
| **Straightforward simple fistula** | Clinical exam + EUA (often combined with surgery). ***Imaging usually not necessary*** [1]. |
| ***Complicated high fistula*** | ***MRI pelvis*** (pre-operative) + EUA [1] |
| ***Recurrent fistula*** | ***MRI pelvis*** + EUA + colonoscopy (to exclude Crohn's) [1] |
| ***Anatomy not obvious*** | ***MRI pelvis*** or endoanal USS [1] |
| **Suspected Crohn's disease** | Colonoscopy + ***MRI and EAUS*** + bloods (CRP, albumin, FBC) [3][8] |
| **Suspected malignancy** | EUA with biopsy + MRI pelvis for staging |
| **Suspected TB** | Histology (caseating granulomata), AFB staining/culture, CXR, IGRA |
| **Post-abscess drainage** | Pus C/ST → gut flora predicts fistula [4] |
| **Pre-existing incontinence** | Endoanal USS or MRI (sphincter mapping) + anorectal manometry |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. **Anorectal fistula is a clinical diagnosis** — history (cyclical pain, discharge, recurrent abscess) + examination (external opening, cord-like tract, DRE).
2. **Goals of investigation**: define anatomy of tract, classify simple vs complex, exclude underlying cause (Crohn's, TB, malignancy).
3. **Goodsall's rule** predicts internal opening location: anterior = straight, posterior = curved to midline. Reliable within 3 cm of anal verge.
4. ***Do NOT probe in clinic*** — probing is done at EUA under anaesthesia to avoid creating false passages.
5. **EUA is required before surgery** — the definitive assessment combining probing, proctoscopy, and surgical planning.
6. ***MRI pelvis*** is the **gold standard imaging** for complicated, recurrent, or anatomically unclear fistulae. It shows primary tract, secondary extensions, abscesses, and sphincter integrity.
7. **Endoanal USS** is an alternative, especially good for sphincter assessment; enhanced with H₂O₂ injection through external opening.
8. ***Imaging is usually not necessary*** for simple fistulae — clinical exam + EUA suffices.
9. **Colonoscopy** is indicated whenever Crohn's disease is suspected.
10. **Pus C/ST** after abscess I&D: gut flora = fistula likely; skin flora = reassurance.
11. Always send fistula tract tissue for **histology** — exclude TB (caseating granuloma), Crohn's (non-caseating), and malignancy.
