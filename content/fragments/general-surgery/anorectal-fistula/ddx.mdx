## Differential Diagnosis of Anorectal Fistula

The differential diagnosis of anorectal fistula essentially boils down to one question: **what else can cause a perianal opening with discharge, pain, or swelling?** Let's work through this systematically from first principles.

A patient presenting with perianal discharge, pain, and/or a visible external opening on the perianal skin could have several conditions. The key is to distinguish a true fistula (communication between two epithelial surfaces) from conditions that mimic it. ***Diagnosis can usually be made by careful history and examination*** [1], but you must actively consider — and exclude — the differential diagnoses below.

### Approach to Differential Diagnosis

The differentials can be organised by the **dominant presenting feature**:

### Detailed Differential Diagnoses

#### 1. Anorectal Abscess

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Relationship to fistula** | Abscess = acute phase; fistula = chronic phase of the **same cryptoglandular process** [2][3]. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | An undrained or incompletely drained abscess can mimic a fistula (and vice versa). A fistula with a blocked external opening re-accumulates pus and presents as a "recurrent abscess." |
| **Key distinguishing features** | ***Constant perianal pain, exacerbated when sitting down*** [4]. ***Erythematous, fluctuant, tender mass*** on palpation/DRE [4]. Systemic features (fever, malaise) more prominent than in chronic fistula. No visible external opening (unless spontaneously draining). |
| **How to differentiate** | Fistula has an established **external opening** with chronic intermittent discharge. Abscess is an acute collection without a mature tract. However, they coexist — ***suspect anal fistula if an anorectal abscess persists after 6–12 weeks*** [3]. |

<Callout title="Abscess vs Fistula — Same Coin, Two Sides" type="error">
Do not think of these as completely separate diagnoses. An abscess that doesn't resolve likely has an underlying fistula. After I&D, always arrange follow-up to assess for fistula. Remember: pus culture with **gut flora = likely fistula**; **skin flora = reassurance** [4].
</Callout>

#### 2. Anal Fissure

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | A tear in the anoderm **distal to the dentate line** [5][6]. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Both present with **painful defecation** and may have perianal discharge/bleeding [2][5]. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | ***Pain on defecation*** — classically described as a **tearing pain** during bowel movement with a brief respite then prolonged burning pain afterwards (due to IAS spasm) [5][6]. ***Fresh rectal bleeding*** — typically small amount on toilet paper or surface of stool [5]. ***Diagnosis is by spreading the buttock to reveal the fissure*** [1]. Most at **posterior midline (6 o'clock)** due to least perfusion [6]. Chronic fissure has **sentinel pile + hypertrophied anal papillae** [6]. |
| **How to differentiate** | Fissure = visible **linear tear** on inspection. Fistula = **external opening** (dimple/granulation tissue) with a palpable **cord-like tract** [3]. Fissure pain is **during and immediately after defecation** (linked to stretching the tear). Fistula pain is **cyclical** — builds when external opening blocks, improves when pus discharges. ***Rectal examination and proctoscopy are painful and not indicated*** in acute fissure [1]. |

<Callout title="Atypical Fissure = Think Crohn's">
***Always suspect perianal Crohn's disease*** if the fissure is: **non-midline, recurring, multiple, unusually deep or wide**, or associated with **perianal hypertrophic skin tags** [6]. In Crohn's, fissures and fistulae often coexist.
</Callout>

#### 3. Pilonidal Sinus

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Formation of a sinus in the **natal cleft** (intergluteal cleft) due to infection and obstruction of a hair follicle → foreign body reaction → cavity formation [7]. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Both present as a **perianal discharging opening** with intermittent pain and swelling [7]. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | Located in the **sacrococcygeal region** (natal cleft), **NOT** at the anal verge. ***Does not continue into the anal canal*** (cf. anal fistula) [7]. Often has **embedded hairs** visible at the sinus opening. Risk factors: Caucasian males with coarse dark body hair, prolonged sitting, increased sweating [7]. **Rare in Hong Kong** [7]. |
| **How to differentiate** | **Location is key**: pilonidal sinus is in the midline natal cleft (between the buttocks, over the sacrococcygeal area), well away from the anus. Anal fistula has its external opening **close to the anus** (usually within 3–5 cm of the anal verge) and communicates with the anal canal on probing/imaging. |

---

#### 4. Perianal Crohn's Disease

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Perianal manifestation of Crohn's disease — affects ***24.5% of patients with Crohn's disease*** [8]. Includes skin tags, fissures, abscesses, fistulae, and strictures. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Crohn's perianal fistulae are a specific subset. But sometimes perianal disease is the **first presentation** of Crohn's, before any intestinal symptoms are apparent — so you must think of it. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | ***More complicated courses of fistula tract*** [8]. Multiple external openings, complex/branching tracts, associated "elephant ear" skin tags, off-midline fissures, rectal stricture. Bowel symptoms (diarrhoea, abdominal pain, weight loss) may or may not be present. ***MRI and EAUS necessary to document before definitive treatment*** [8]. |
| **How to differentiate** | Colonoscopy if Crohn's is suspected [3]. Look for skip lesions, cobblestoning, non-caseating granulomata on biopsy. ***Anti-TNF +/- AZA and/or seton drainage*** is the treatment approach [8] — very different from simple cryptoglandular fistula management. |

<Callout title="Perianal Crohn's — Don't Miss It">
Any patient with a **complex, recurrent, or atypical fistula** (multiple tracts, off-midline, associated with non-healing wounds) should be investigated for **Crohn's disease** with colonoscopy, even in the absence of GI symptoms. ***83% of perianal Crohn's patients required surgery*** [8].
</Callout>

#### 5. Anal Carcinoma

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Malignancy of the anal canal — **80% squamous cell carcinoma** (below dentate line), 10% adenocarcinoma (above dentate line), others include melanoma [7]. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Can present with **painful PR bleeding, perianal mass, and discharge** — mimicking a fistula. A malignant fistula may also develop. ***Colorectal neoplasm needs to be excluded*** [1]. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | **Hard, irregular, non-tender mass** on DRE (vs. the soft granulation tissue of a fistula opening). Risk factors: HPV infection (esp. 16/18), HIV, smoking, immunosuppression [7]. May have **inguinal lymphadenopathy** (tumour below dentate line drains to superficial inguinal nodes) [7]. |
| **How to differentiate** | **Biopsy any suspicious, indurated, or non-healing perianal lesion** under EUA. MRI pelvis for staging. Always send tissue from the fistula tract for histology at the time of surgery — to exclude malignancy. |

---

#### 6. Hidradenitis Suppurativa

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Chronic inflammatory condition of the **apocrine sweat glands** (found in axillae, groin, perineum, perianal area). Leads to recurrent abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Produces **multiple discharging sinuses** in the perianal/perineal area that can be confused with complex fistulae. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | Typically **bilateral**, involving the **perineum and groin** (not centred on the anal canal). Extensive **scarring and bridged skin** between sinuses. Often also affects axillae and inguinal folds. **No internal opening in the anal canal** on anoscopy/proctoscopy. |
| **How to differentiate** | Distribution pattern (bilateral, groin/axilla involvement). On examination/imaging, there is no communication with the anal canal lumen. |

---

#### 7. Presacral Epidermoid / Dermoid Cyst

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Developmental cyst in the presacral/retrorectal space. Can become infected and present as a perianal/gluteal abscess or draining sinus [2]. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | When infected, it can mimic an anorectal abscess or fistula with posterior perianal swelling and discharge. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | Mass is typically **posterior**, palpable on DRE as a **smooth, well-defined retrorectal mass**. No internal opening at the dentate line. MRI shows a well-circumscribed presacral cystic lesion. |
| **How to differentiate** | MRI pelvis differentiates from fistula. No communication with anal canal lumen. |

---

#### 8. Anal Ulcers or Sores [2]

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What are they?** | Ulceration of the anal canal/perianal skin from various causes: STIs (syphilitic chancre, HSV, chancroid), TB, HIV, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. |
| **Why they're in the DDx** | Can present with perianal pain, discharge, and visible lesion — similar to the external opening of a fistula. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | **No palpable tract or cord** connecting to an internal opening. Syphilitic chancre: painless ulcer with raised edges. HSV: multiple shallow painful vesicles/ulcers. Solitary rectal ulcer: anterior rectal wall, associated with straining/rectal prolapse. |
| **How to differentiate** | Careful inspection (no tract), STI screening (serology, swabs), biopsy if needed. |

---

#### 9. Rectal Prolapse [9]

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | Protrusion of rectal wall through the anus — full thickness (procidentia) or mucosal only. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Can present with **mucus discharge, pain, and perianal wetness** — similar to fistula symptoms [9]. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | Visible **circumferential concentric mucosal folds** protruding through the anus (vs. radial folds in prolapsed haemorrhoids). History of mass protruding on straining that reduces spontaneously or manually. Predominantly elderly women [9]. |
| **How to differentiate** | Ask the patient to strain — prolapse becomes visible. No external opening or tract. |

---

#### 10. Proctalgia Fugax [7]

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **What is it?** | ***Benign, brief attacks of rectal pain at night, unrelated to defecation*** — occurs in **young anxious men** [7]. |
| **Why it's in the DDx** | Episodic perianal/rectal pain could be confused with the cyclical pain of a fistula. |
| **Key distinguishing features** | **No discharge, no external opening, no physical findings.** Pain is brief (seconds to minutes), often nocturnal, resolves spontaneously. Diagnosis of exclusion. |
| **How to differentiate** | Entirely clinical — **normal examination**. No tract, no opening, no discharge. |

---

### Summary Differential Diagnosis Table

| Condition | Key Distinguishing Feature from Fistula |
|---|---|
| **Anorectal abscess** | Acute fluctuant tender mass, no mature external opening/tract |
| **Anal fissure** | Visible linear tear at anal verge, tearing pain on defecation, no tract |
| **Pilonidal sinus** | Natal cleft location (sacrococcygeal), does not communicate with anal canal |
| **Perianal Crohn's disease** | Multiple complex tracts, skin tags, associated GI symptoms, non-caseating granulomata |
| **Anal carcinoma** | Hard irregular mass, inguinal LN, non-healing, HPV risk factors |
| **Hidradenitis suppurativa** | Bilateral perineal/groin sinuses, axillary involvement, no anal canal communication |
| **Presacral cyst** | Posterior retrorectal smooth mass on DRE, no internal anal opening |
| **Anal ulcers/sores** | No tract or cord, consider STI and TB, biopsy |
| **Rectal prolapse** | Circumferential mucosal protrusion on straining, no external opening |
| **Proctalgia fugax** | Normal examination, brief nocturnal pain, diagnosis of exclusion |

### Clinical Decision-Making Flow

When you see a patient with a **perianal external opening and discharge**, your systematic approach should be:

1. **Is it a fistula or something else?** — Examine for a tract, look for internal opening, check location relative to anal canal.
2. **If it's a fistula, is it simple or complex?** — Parks classification, assess sphincter involvement.
3. **Is there an underlying cause?** — Always consider Crohn's disease (colonoscopy), TB (especially in HK), and malignancy (biopsy).
4. ***Common anorectal conditions are mostly benign*** but ***colorectal neoplasm needs to be excluded*** [1].

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

1. The **three core differentials** listed in senior notes are: **anorectal abscess, anal fissure, and anal ulcers/sores** [2].
2. **Anorectal abscess** = acute phase of the same cryptoglandular process; suspect fistula if abscess persists > 6–12 weeks.
3. **Anal fissure** = linear tear below dentate line; tearing pain on defecation; posterior midline; no tract.
4. **Pilonidal sinus** is in the natal cleft and does NOT communicate with the anal canal — this is the key differentiator.
5. ***Always exclude Crohn's disease*** in complex/recurrent/atypical fistulae — perianal CD affects ~24.5% of Crohn's patients.
6. ***Always exclude malignancy*** — biopsy any suspicious, indurated, non-healing perianal lesion; colorectal neoplasm needs to be excluded.
7. **Hidradenitis suppurativa** mimics complex fistulae but has bilateral distribution, groin/axillary involvement, and no anal canal communication.
8. **Proctalgia fugax** = normal examination, brief nocturnal pain in young anxious men — diagnosis of exclusion.
