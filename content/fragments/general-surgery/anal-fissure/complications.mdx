## Complications of Anal Fissure

Complications can be organised into two categories: (A) **complications of the disease itself** (what happens if the fissure is left untreated or doesn't respond), and (B) **complications of treatment** (side effects and adverse outcomes of medical and surgical therapy). Both are important for exams. Let's walk through each from first principles.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1. Chronicity (Acute → Chronic Fissure)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | An acute fissure that fails to heal within 6 weeks becomes a **chronic fissure** — the single most common "complication" of an untreated or inadequately treated acute fissure [2] |
| **Why it happens** | The vicious cycle of pain → ***IAS spasm*** → ***ischaemia of the overlying anoderm at the posterior midline*** [1] → impaired healing perpetuates itself. Without intervention to break this cycle, the wound cannot close. |
| **Pathological changes** | The chronic fissure develops the characteristic ***triad***: (1) ***Sentinel pile*** at the distal end [1], (2) ***Hypertrophic papilla*** at the proximal end [1], (3) ***Internal sphincter muscle fibres visible at base of fissure*** [1]. The edges become fibrotic and rolled. The base becomes indurated. These changes represent **failed wound healing** with progressive fibrosis. |
| **Clinical significance** | A chronic fissure will not heal with conservative measures alone — it requires **pharmacological or surgical intervention**. The fibrotic tissue at the fissure edges has poor vascularity and cannot re-epithelialise without the underlying IAS spasm being addressed. |

#### 2. Perianal Abscess Formation

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | A deep chronic fissure can extend through the anoderm into the intersphincteric space. Faecal bacteria colonise this space → suppuration → **perianal or intersphincteric abscess** |
| **Why it happens** | The base of a chronic fissure exposes the ***internal sphincter muscle fibres*** [1]. If the tear extends deep enough, it breaches the IAS entirely and communicates with the intersphincteric plane — a potential space that is vulnerable to infection. The warm, moist, bacteria-rich environment of the anal canal provides the inoculum. |
| **Clinical features** | Transition from pain purely on defaecation to **constant, throbbing pain** with swelling, erythema, and possibly fever/systemic symptoms. A tender fluctuant mass may become palpable perianally. |
| **Management** | Incision and drainage under GA. Antibiotics if surrounding cellulitis or immunocompromised [14]. Pus sent for culture and sensitivity. |

#### 3. Anorectal Fistula Formation

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | A chronic deep fissure with associated abscess can spontaneously drain, forming an **anorectal fistula** — an abnormal epithelialised tract connecting the anal canal (internal opening) to the perianal skin (external opening) |
| **Why it happens** | This follows the **cryptoglandular theory**: infection spreads from the base of the fissure into the intersphincteric plane → abscess forms → pus tracks along the path of least resistance → eventually discharges to the perianal skin, creating a fistula tract. Essentially, fissure → abscess → fistula represents a **continuum of the same pathological process** (anorectal sepsis). In Crohn's disease, this progression is particularly common due to transmural inflammation predisposing to ***perianal disease — skin tags, anal fissures, perirectal abscess and anorectal fistulas*** [15]. |
| **Clinical features** | Intermittent purulent perianal discharge, pain that improves when pus drains, palpable cord-like tract on PR examination |
| **Management** | Depends on fistula type (Parks classification) — ranges from fistulotomy for simple fistulas to seton placement or advancement flap for complex fistulas |

<Callout title="The Anorectal Sepsis Continuum">
Think of fissure → abscess → fistula as a spectrum of the same disease:
- **Fissure** = initial tear
- **Abscess** = acute suppuration when the fissure extends deep enough for bacterial invasion
- **Fistula** = chronic tract that forms after the abscess drains

This continuum is why chronic non-healing fissures must be taken seriously — they can progress to much more complex surgical problems.

#### 4. Anal Stenosis (Stricture)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | Repeated cycles of fissuring, fibrosis, and healing can lead to progressive **fibrotic narrowing of the anal canal** |
| **Why it happens** | Each episode of fissure → healing deposits scar tissue (fibrosis) in the anoderm and underlying sphincter. Over time, circumferential or extensive fibrosis contracts the anal canal lumen. This is analogous to how repeated oesophageal ulceration leads to oesophageal stricture. |
| **Clinical features** | Progressive difficulty passing stool, pencil-thin stools, worsening pain and constipation, a cycle of further trauma. On examination: a tight, fibrotic anal canal that barely admits a finger. |
| **Management** | Gentle anal dilatation (graduated dilators), fissurectomy with advancement flap, or rarely anoplasty for severe cases |

#### 5. Secondary Infection

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | The open wound of the fissure is continuously exposed to faecal flora → secondary bacterial infection of the wound |
| **Why it happens** | The anal canal is one of the most heavily colonised sites in the body. An open wound in this environment is a setup for infection. Normally the epithelial barrier provides protection, but a fissure removes this barrier. |
| **Clinical features** | Increased pain, perianal cellulitis (erythema, warmth, swelling extending beyond the fissure), purulent discharge, fever (if progresses to abscess) |
| **Management** | Antibiotics if cellulitis; I&D if abscess. Addressing the underlying fissure is essential. |

#### 6. Chronic Pain and Psychosocial Impact

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | Chronic, unremitting anal pain significantly impacts quality of life — patients develop anxiety about defaecation, avoidance behaviours, dietary restriction (eating less to produce less stool), and social withdrawal |
| **Why it happens** | The pain of anal fissure is among the most severe in clinical practice — the anoderm has the same density of somatic nerve endings as fingertip skin. Chronic pain → central sensitisation → pain may persist even after the fissure heals (though this is uncommon). The avoidance cycle (fear of defaecation → constipation → harder stool → more trauma) creates a self-reinforcing psychological component. |
| **Clinical significance** | Must be addressed holistically — reassurance, adequate analgesia, and definitive treatment of the fissure. Depression and anxiety screening may be warranted in chronic cases. |

#### 7. Iron Deficiency Anaemia (Rare)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What happens** | Chronic, repeated small-volume bleeding from the fissure over months to years can lead to iron deficiency anaemia |
| **Why it happens** | Although each episode produces only a small amount of blood (on toilet paper, surface of stool), cumulative daily losses eventually deplete iron stores → microcytic hypochromic anaemia. This is uncommon because the bleeding volume per episode is typically tiny, but can occur in chronic, neglected cases. |
| **Clinical features** | Fatigue, pallor, dyspnoea on exertion, palpitations |
| **Investigation** | FBC (low MCV, low Hb), iron studies (low ferritin, low serum iron, high TIBC) |

### B. Complications of Treatment

#### 1. Complications of Topical Vasodilators

| Treatment | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Topical GTN (nitroglycerin)*** [1][3] | ***Headache*** [3] | GTN is a systemic NO donor — absorbed through perianal skin and enters systemic circulation → vasodilatation of cerebral vessels → headache. This is the same mechanism as the headache side effect of sublingual GTN for angina. Reported in up to 20–60% of patients; dose-limiting and the main cause of non-compliance. |
| Topical GTN | Dizziness / hypotension | Systemic vasodilatation → reduced SVR → postural hypotension |
| ***Topical nifedipine / diltiazem*** [1][3] | Minor local irritation | Local reaction to the ointment base. Systemic absorption is minimal, hence fewer headaches. |
| All topical vasodilators | ***Risk of incontinence*** [3] | Any agent that reduces IAS tone could theoretically impair the contribution of the IAS to resting continence. In practice, this is rare with topical agents and is typically limited to minor flatus incontinence. |
| All topical vasodilators | **Recurrence** | Topical agents have recurrence rates of ~40–50% after initial healing, because they provide temporary sphincter relaxation without permanently addressing the underlying hypertonic sphincter |

#### 2. Complications of Botulinum Toxin Injection

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Temporary flatus incontinence** | Botulinum toxin paralyses the IAS → reduced resting anal tone → minor leakage of flatus. Self-limiting as the toxin wears off (~3 months when new nerve terminals regenerate). |
| **Faecal incontinence** (rare, < 5%) | Excessive or misdirected injection → over-weakening of IAS tone → cannot maintain continence. Usually temporary. |
| **Perianal haematoma** | Direct trauma from the injection needle to perianal vessels |
| **Failure / recurrence** | Insufficient dose, incorrect injection site, antibody formation (rare with single injection) |

#### 3. Complications of Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy (LIS)

This is the most important section because LIS is the **gold standard** surgery, and its complications are high yield for exams.

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism & Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Faecal incontinence*** | ***0–15%*** [1] | The IAS is responsible for ~70–85% of resting anal tone. Dividing it permanently reduces resting pressure. If too much IAS is divided, or if the patient has pre-existing sphincter weakness (e.g., previous obstetric injury, ageing), the remaining sphincter mechanism may be insufficient → incontinence. ***Most are minor with flatus incontinence*** [1] — meaning patients notice inability to control passage of gas, rather than frank leakage of liquid or solid stool. True faecal incontinence is rare (< 3%). |
| **Urinary retention** | Variable | Post-operative pain and reflex IAS/pelvic floor spasm → inhibition of the detrusor muscle via spinal reflex arcs → difficulty initiating micturition. Same mechanism as urinary retention after haemorrhoidectomy. Causes include: pain and anal spasm, fluid overload, rectal packing, drugs (narcotics, anticholinergics), pre-existing outflow tract obstruction [6]. Managed by leaving urinary catheter in situ for 24 hours [6]. |
| **Post-operative pain** | Common | Surgical wound in the highly sensitive anoderm (somatic innervation). ***Pain is almost universal after anorectal surgery (~100% due to IAS spasm)*** [6]. Managed with analgesia (paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids if needed), sitz baths, stool softeners. |
| **Bleeding** | Uncommon | Injury to branches of the inferior rectal artery during the sphincterotomy. Usually minor and self-limiting. Rarely requires return to theatre. |
| ***Anal stenosis*** | Rare | Excessive scarring and fibrosis at the sphincterotomy site → narrowing of the anal canal. More common if too much tissue is excised or if there is post-operative infection. Managed with graduated anal dilatation [6]. |
| **Perianal abscess / wound infection** | Rare | Contamination of the surgical wound with faecal bacteria. The anal canal is a "dirty" surgical field by definition. Prophylactic antibiotics and meticulous wound care reduce this risk. |
| **Keyhole deformity** | If posterior | This is why LIS is performed **laterally** rather than posteriorly. A posterior sphincterotomy creates a gutter-like defect (keyhole) that allows mucus and stool to leak → soiling. The lateral approach avoids this. |
| **Recurrence** | < 5% | Incomplete division of the IAS → persistent spasm → recurrent fissure. Much lower recurrence than medical therapy. |

<Callout title="The Trade-Off of Surgery" type="error">

***Lateral internal sphincterotomy: healing rate 95%, incontinence 0–15%*** [1]. This is the fundamental trade-off that every patient must be counselled about. You are PERMANENTLY dividing part of the IAS — this cannot be reversed. In young healthy patients with high sphincter tone, the risk is very low. In ***multiparous women, older patients*** [4], the risk is unacceptably high → choose ***fissurectomy + V-Y advancement flap (sphincter-sparing)*** [4] instead. Always assess pre-operative sphincter function (manometry ± endoanal USS) before committing to LIS.

</Callout>

#### 4. Complications of Fissurectomy + V-Y Advancement Flap

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Flap dehiscence / failure** | The advancement flap separates from the wound bed due to tension, infection, or poor blood supply → wound breakdown → recurrence of the defect |
| **Wound infection** | Same principle as LIS — contaminated surgical field |
| **Recurrence** | Higher than LIS (~10–15%) because the underlying IAS hypertonia is NOT addressed (the sphincter is preserved) → the pathophysiological driver remains |
| **No incontinence from the procedure itself** | Key advantage — the IAS is not divided. However, pre-existing incontinence from other causes is not improved either. |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Anal Fissure">

1. **Most common complication of the disease**: Progression to **chronicity** — the fissure develops sentinel pile, hypertrophic papilla, and exposed IAS fibres at the base.

2. **Fissure → Abscess → Fistula continuum**: A deep chronic fissure can progress to perianal abscess and then anorectal fistula via the cryptoglandular mechanism. Especially common in **Crohn's disease**.

3. **Anal stenosis**: Repeated cycles of fissuring and fibrosis narrow the anal canal.

4. **GTN side effects**: ***Headache*** (most common, dose-limiting, up to 60%) due to systemic NO-mediated cerebral vasodilatation. Nifedipine/diltiazem have fewer headaches.

5. **LIS complications**: ***Healing rate 95%, incontinence 0–15% — most are minor with flatus incontinence***. This is the key trade-off. Avoid LIS in high-risk patients (multiparous, elderly) → use sphincter-sparing fissurectomy + advancement flap instead.

6. **Post-anorectal surgery complications**: Pain (almost universal), urinary retention, bleeding, infection, anal stenosis, faecal incontinence.
