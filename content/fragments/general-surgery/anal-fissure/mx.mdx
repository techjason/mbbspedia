## Management of Anal Fissure

### Guiding Principles

Before diving into specific treatments, let's ground ourselves in the pathophysiology, because **every single treatment targets a specific point in the vicious cycle**:

```
Trauma → Tear → Pain → IAS spasm → ↓ Blood flow (ischaemia) → Impaired healing → Chronicity
                  ↘ Fear → Avoidance → Constipation → Re-trauma ↗
```

| Therapeutic Target | Treatment Modality |
|---|---|
| **Reduce trauma / soften stool** | Fibre supplements, stool softeners, laxatives, adequate fluid intake |
| **Reduce pain** | Topical anaesthetics (lidocaine), sitz baths |
| **Relax IAS / reduce spasm** | Topical GTN, topical nifedipine/diltiazem, botulinum toxin, lateral internal sphincterotomy |
| **Improve blood flow** | Topical vasodilators (GTN, CCBs), sitz baths |
| **Mechanically break the cycle** | Surgical division of IAS (sphincterotomy), fissurectomy + advancement flap |

The overarching strategy follows a **step-up approach**: start conservative → escalate to pharmacological → escalate to surgical if medical treatment fails.

### Step 1: Conservative / Supportive Management

This is the first-line treatment for **all** anal fissures, and is sufficient for the majority of **acute** fissures. The lecture slides group these as ***non-operative treatment: bulk agents, stool softeners and topical anaesthetics*** [1].

#### A. Dietary and Lifestyle Modification

| Measure | Mechanism (from first principles) | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Increased dietary fibre*** [1][2][3] | Fibre adds bulk to stool and retains water → softer, bulkier stool that passes more easily → less mechanical trauma to the anoderm | Aim for 25–30 g/day. Sources: vegetables, fruits, whole grains, psyllium husk (e.g., Metamucil). "Bulk agents" = fibre supplements. |
| **Adequate fluid intake** [2][3] | Water works synergistically with fibre — without adequate fluid, fibre can paradoxically worsen constipation (fibre needs water to swell and soften stool) | Aim for 1.5–2 L/day |
| ***Stool softeners / laxatives*** [1][2][3] | Osmotic laxatives (lactulose, macrogol/PEG) draw water into the bowel lumen → softer stool. Stool softeners (docusate) act as surfactants to allow water penetration into stool. Both reduce the need to strain. | Used as adjunct when dietary modification alone is insufficient |
| **Avoid straining** [2] | Straining increases intra-abdominal and intra-anal pressure → increases IAS tone → worsens ischaemia and re-opens the tear | Advise patients not to sit on the toilet for prolonged periods; go when there is an urge rather than forcing |

#### B. Warm Sitz Bath

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Sitting in a basin of warm water (not hot) covering the perineum for 10–15 minutes, 2–3 times daily and after bowel movements |
| **Mechanism** | Warmth causes **relaxation of the IAS smooth muscle** → reduces spasm → reduces pain. Also causes local **vasodilatation** → improves blood flow to the ischaemic posterior midline → promotes healing [2]. Additionally provides soothing effect and helps keep the area clean. |
| **Evidence** | Simple, free, no side effects. Part of the standard conservative package for all fissures. |

#### C. Topical Anaesthetics

| Agent | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Topical anaesthetics*** e.g. ***5% lignocaine (lidocaine) jelly*** [1][3] | Lignocaine is an amide-type local anaesthetic that blocks voltage-gated sodium channels in sensory nerve endings → prevents depolarisation → blocks pain signal transmission from the exposed somatic nerves in the fissure | Applied before defaecation to reduce the sharp pain. Provides symptomatic relief but does NOT address the underlying IAS spasm or ischaemia — purely palliative. Important as an adjunct to allow more comfortable defaecation and break the avoidance/constipation cycle. |

<Callout title="Conservative Measures Alone Heal ~50% of Acute Fissures" type="idea">
With dietary modification, stool softeners, sitz baths, and topical anaesthetics, approximately half of acute fissures will heal within 6 weeks. The key is breaking the constipation-trauma cycle and giving the anoderm time to re-epithelialise. If it doesn't heal → escalate to topical vasodilators.
</Callout>

### Step 2: First-Line Medical Therapy — Topical Vasodilators

These are the ***newer topical agents to reduce internal sphincter pressure*** mentioned in the lecture slides [1]. They are the cornerstone of medical treatment for anal fissure.

#### A. Topical Nitroglycerin (GTN) Ointment

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Drug** | 0.2–0.4% ***nitroglycerin*** (glyceryl trinitrate / GTN) ointment [1][2][3] |
| **Mechanism** | GTN is a **nitric oxide (NO) donor**. NO activates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscle → increases cGMP → smooth muscle relaxation. Applied to the perianal skin, it is absorbed and causes: (1) **Relaxation of the IAS smooth muscle** → reduces resting anal pressure → breaks the spasm cycle. (2) **Local vasodilatation** → increases blood flow to the ischaemic posterior midline → promotes healing. |
| **Application** | Applied perianally (to the anal margin, NOT inserted into the canal) 2–3 times daily for 6–8 weeks |
| **Efficacy** | Healing rate ~50–68% (superior to placebo but inferior to surgery). Recurrence rate is significant (~50% at long-term follow-up). |
| **Side effects** | ***Headache*** [3] — the most common side effect (up to 20–60% of patients). This is because GTN is absorbed systemically and causes vasodilatation of cerebral vessels (the same reason IV GTN causes headaches in angina patients). Headache is dose-limiting and is the main reason for non-compliance. Also: dizziness, hypotension. |
| **Contraindications** | Concurrent use of PDE5 inhibitors (sildenafil etc.) — risk of severe hypotension. Severe hypotension/haemodynamic instability. |
| **Indications** | First-line pharmacological treatment for acute fissure not responding to conservative measures alone, and for chronic fissures |

#### B. Topical Calcium Channel Blockers

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Drugs** | ***Topical nifedipine*** ointment (0.2–0.5%) [1][2][3]; ***topical 0.5% diltiazem*** [3] |
| **Mechanism** | Nifedipine and diltiazem are **calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**. They block L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in smooth muscle → prevent calcium influx → IAS smooth muscle cannot contract effectively → **reduces IAS spasm** and **improves local blood flow**. The name gives a clue: "nifedipine" → "-dipine" suffix = dihydropyridine CCB = primarily acts on vascular/smooth muscle. |
| **Application** | Applied perianally 2–3 times daily for 6–8 weeks |
| **Efficacy** | Similar to GTN (~65–70% healing rate). Some studies suggest slightly better tolerability due to fewer headaches. |
| **Side effects** | Much **fewer headaches** than GTN (main advantage). Mild local irritation. Theoretically: ***risk of incontinence*** [3] (any agent that reduces IAS tone can cause minor flatus incontinence, though this is rare with topical agents). |
| **Indications** | First-line alternative to GTN (especially if GTN not tolerated due to headache). ***Topical nifedipine*** or ***diltiazem*** can be used interchangeably as first-line. |

<Callout title="GTN vs Nifedipine — Which to Choose?">

Both are first-line options with similar efficacy. The practical choice often comes down to side effects:
- **GTN**: Well-studied, widely available, but ***headache*** is a major problem (up to 60%). Many patients stop treatment because of this.
- **Nifedipine/Diltiazem**: Fewer headaches, better tolerated. Increasingly preferred as first-line in many centres.

Both work by the same principle: **reduce IAS pressure → break the spasm–ischaemia cycle**.

</Callout>

### Step 3: Second-Line Medical Therapy — Botulinum Toxin

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Drug** | ***Botulinum toxin*** (Botox) type A, ***50 IU*** [1][3] |
| **Mechanism** | Botulinum toxin ("botulinum" from Latin *botulus* = sausage, because it was first identified in sausage food poisoning) is a neurotoxin produced by *Clostridium botulinum*. It cleaves **SNARE proteins** (specifically SNAP-25) at the neuromuscular junction → prevents acetylcholine release from presynaptic nerve terminals → **chemical denervation** of the IAS smooth muscle → muscle paralysis → reduces IAS spasm. Effect lasts ~3 months (until new nerve terminals sprout). |
| **Administration** | Injected directly into the internal anal sphincter under local or general anaesthesia (often during EUA). Usually injected at multiple sites around the IAS. |
| **Efficacy** | Healing rate ~60–80%. Can be repeated if first injection fails. |
| **Side effects** | Temporary flatus incontinence (usually mild and self-limiting as the toxin wears off). Very rarely: faecal incontinence (< 5%). Perianal haematoma at injection site. |
| **Indications** | ***Second-line medical therapy*** [3]: patients who **fail 8 weeks of topical vasodilator therapy** [2], or who cannot tolerate GTN/nifedipine. Also useful as a bridge in patients where surgery is relatively contraindicated (e.g., Crohn's disease). |
| **Contraindications** | Known allergy to botulinum toxin. Myasthenia gravis or other neuromuscular junction disorders (risk of systemic weakness). Active perianal sepsis. |

> **High Yield**: Botulinum toxin is positioned as a second-line option between topical vasodilators and surgery. It provides a **reversible** chemical sphincterotomy — unlike surgical sphincterotomy, which is permanent. This makes it particularly useful in patients at high risk of incontinence.

---

### Step 4: Surgical Management

***Indicated in patients who fail 8 weeks of initial medical treatment*** [2] (some sources say fail conservative management for 8 weeks overall [4]). Before ANY surgery: ***endoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease first*** [4] — this is a critical pre-operative step because operating on a Crohn's fissure without treating the underlying disease leads to disastrous wound healing.

#### Pre-Operative Preparation

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| ***Endoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease*** [4] | Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy before proceeding to surgery. Crohn's patients heal poorly and may develop non-healing wounds, fistulae, or abscesses after sphincterotomy. |
| **Anorectal manometry** (selected patients) | Assess resting IAS pressure and EAS squeeze pressure. Guides choice between sphincterotomy (if hypertonic) vs sphincter-sparing (if normal/low tone). |
| **Stool softener** | Start pre-operatively to reduce post-operative pain from hard stool [6] |
| **Position** | ***Prone jackknife or lithotomy position*** [6] |
| **Anaesthesia** | ***Perianal local anaesthesia / spinal anaesthesia / general anaesthesia*** [6] |

#### A. Lateral Internal Sphincterotomy (LIS)

This is the **gold standard** surgical treatment for chronic anal fissure.

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | ***Lateral internal sphincterotomy is the commonest surgery for anal fissure*** [1]. It involves a **controlled, partial division of the internal anal sphincter** at the lateral aspect (away from the fissure itself, which is usually posterior). |
| **Why "lateral"?** | The sphincterotomy is performed **laterally** (at the 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock position) rather than at the site of the fissure (posterior midline). Why? Because cutting the IAS at the posterior midline (where the fissure already is) would create a "keyhole deformity" — a gutter-like defect that causes soiling and mucus leakage. Lateral division avoids this. |
| **Why "internal"?** | Only the **internal** anal sphincter is divided (the involuntary smooth muscle responsible for ~80% of resting tone). The **external** sphincter (voluntary skeletal muscle) is preserved entirely. This is why continence is maintained. |
| **How much to divide** | The IAS is divided up to the level of the dentate line (approximately the length of the fissure, or roughly the distal 1/3 of the IAS). Over-division causes incontinence; under-division causes treatment failure. |
| **Mechanism** | By permanently reducing resting IAS tone, the surgery: (1) Eliminates the spasm component of the vicious cycle. (2) Allows wound edge apposition. (3) Restores blood flow to the posterior midline. The fissure then heals by secondary intention. |
| **Technique** | Can be performed **open** (small incision at the intersphincteric groove, IAS identified and divided under direct vision) or **closed** (blade inserted through a small stab incision and IAS divided — faster but less controlled). |
| **Efficacy** | ***Healing rate: 95%*** [1] — the most effective treatment available |
| **Complications** | ***Incontinence: 0–15%, most are minor with flatus incontinence*** [1]. This is the main risk. Breakdown: minor flatus incontinence is most common; significant faecal incontinence is rare (< 3%). Other complications: bleeding, haematoma, perianal abscess (rare). |
| **Indications** | Chronic fissure failing 8 weeks of medical treatment [2][4]; ***low risk of faecal incontinence*** [4] (young males, no prior sphincter injury) |
| **Contraindications** | ***High risk of incontinence*** (multiparous women, elderly, prior anal surgery, pre-existing sphincter damage, low resting pressures on manometry) [4]; active Crohn's disease (impaired healing); active perianal sepsis |

<Callout title="LIS — Key Numbers to Remember">

- ***Healing rate: 95%*** [1]
- ***Incontinence risk: 0–15%*** [1]
- ***Most incontinence is minor = flatus incontinence*** [1]
- Recurrence rate: < 5%
- This is the MOST effective treatment for anal fissure — but the incontinence risk means it must be used judiciously.

</Callout>

#### B. Fissurectomy + V-Y Advancement Flap (Sphincter-Sparing)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | Excision of the chronic fissure (including sentinel pile, hypertrophied papilla, and fibrotic tissue) WITHOUT cutting the IAS. The resulting defect is then covered with a **V-Y advancement flap** — a flap of perianal skin advanced to cover the wound and provide fresh, well-vascularised tissue. |
| **Mechanism** | By excising the chronic fibrotic fissure, you remove the unhealthy tissue that will never heal on its own. The advancement flap provides: (1) Well-vascularised tissue cover. (2) Reduces tension on wound edges. (3) Avoids the need to divide the IAS — hence "sphincter-sparing". |
| **Efficacy** | Healing rate ~85–90% (slightly lower than LIS, but avoids incontinence risk) |
| **Complications** | Flap failure/dehiscence, infection, recurrence (higher than LIS), but **no risk of incontinence from the procedure itself** |
| **Indications** | ***High risk of incontinence: e.g., multiparous women, older patients*** [4] — anyone in whom you cannot afford to reduce sphincter tone further. Also used for fissures associated with low sphincter pressures. |
| **Contraindications** | Active perianal sepsis, active Crohn's (relative) |

<Callout title="Choosing Between LIS and Fissurectomy + Advancement Flap" type="idea">

Think of it simply:
- **LIS** = most effective (95% healing) but trades off a small risk of incontinence. Best for **young, healthy patients with high sphincter tone** and no prior sphincter injury.
- **Fissurectomy + V-Y advancement flap** = slightly less effective (~85-90%) but **sphincter-sparing**. Best for patients where **any degree of incontinence would be unacceptable** — ***multiparous women, older patients***, those with pre-existing sphincter weakness [4].

</Callout>

### Management of Secondary (Atypical) Fissures

These require treatment of the **underlying cause** rather than (or in addition to) standard fissure treatment:

| Secondary Cause | Management Approach |
|---|---|
| **Crohn's disease** | **Medical treatment of Crohn's is the priority** (immunomodulators, biologics). Supportive fissure treatment (stool softeners, sitz baths, topical vasodilators). **Avoid LIS** — Crohn's patients have impaired wound healing and high risk of non-healing wound, fistula formation, and incontinence. Botulinum toxin may be used as a bridge. Fissurectomy + advancement flap only if absolutely necessary. |
| **TB** | Anti-TB chemotherapy (standard 6-month RIPE regimen). Supportive perianal care. |
| **HIV** | Antiretroviral therapy. Topical vasodilators for symptomatic relief. Biopsy to exclude CMV or other opportunistic cause. |
| **Syphilis** | Penicillin (standard treatment for syphilis). The "fissure" (chancre) heals with treatment of the infection. |
| **CMV** | Ganciclovir or valganciclovir (especially in immunocompromised patients). |
| **Malignancy** | Treatment according to staging (wide local excision for T1N0 anal SCC; chemoradiation for higher stages). |

---

### Prevention of Recurrence

***Prevention of anal fissures*** [2]:

| Measure | Rationale |
|---|---|
| ***High fibre diet and adequate fluids*** [2] | Maintains soft, bulky stool → reduces mechanical trauma |
| ***Avoid trauma to anus*** [2] | Self-explanatory — avoid anal intercourse or instrumentation during healing |
| ***Avoid straining during defaecation*** [2] | Straining increases IAS pressure → ischaemia → re-tear |
| ***Prompt treatment of diarrhoea*** [2] | Prolonged diarrhoea causes repeated passage of irritant liquid stool → re-traumatises healing anoderm |
| ***Proper anal hygiene*** [2] | Keep the anal area dry; wipe with soft moist cloth rather than rough toilet paper → reduces irritation to healing tissue |

---

### Summary of Treatment Step-Up Approach

| Step | Treatment | Healing Rate | When to Escalate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Conservative** | Fibre, stool softeners, sitz bath, topical anaesthetics | ~50% (acute) | Failure after 6–8 weeks |
| **2. First-line medical** | ***Topical GTN or nifedipine/diltiazem*** + supportive | ~50–70% | Failure after 8 weeks |
| **3. Second-line medical** | ***Botulinum toxin 50 IU*** injection | ~60–80% | Failure or recurrence |
| **4. Surgery** | ***LIS*** (low incontinence risk) or ***Fissurectomy + V-Y flap*** (high incontinence risk) | ***95%*** (LIS) / ~85–90% (flap) | — |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Management of Anal Fissure">

1. **All fissures**: Start with ***conservative management — bulk agents, stool softeners, topical anaesthetics*** + sitz baths + dietary modification.

2. **First-line pharmacological**: ***Newer topical agents to reduce internal sphincter pressure — nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers*** [1]. GTN causes headache; nifedipine/diltiazem better tolerated. Both relax IAS and improve blood flow.

3. **Second-line**: ***Botulinum toxin*** 50 IU injection into IAS [1][3]. Reversible chemical sphincterotomy. Good bridge option.

4. **Surgery if fail 8 weeks of medical treatment** [2][4]: ***Endoscopy to rule out Crohn's disease first*** [4].
   - **Low risk of incontinence** → ***Lateral internal sphincterotomy*** (***commonest surgery, healing rate 95%, incontinence 0–15% mostly flatus***) [1].
   - ***High risk of incontinence (multiparous women, older patients)*** → ***Fissurectomy + V-Y advancement flap (sphincter-sparing)*** [4].

5. **Atypical/secondary fissures**: Treat the underlying cause (Crohn's, TB, HIV, syphilis). Avoid sphincterotomy in Crohn's.

6. **Prevention**: High fibre, adequate fluids, avoid straining, proper hygiene, prompt treatment of diarrhoea.
