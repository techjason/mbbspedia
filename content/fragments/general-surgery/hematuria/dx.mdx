## Diagnostic Criteria, Diagnostic Algorithm and Investigation Modalities for Hematuria

### 1. Confirming True Hematuria — The Starting Point

Before launching any expensive investigation, you must first answer: **"Is this actually blood in the urine?"** This sounds obvious, but it is the critical first step that prevents unnecessary workups for pseudohematuria.

#### 1.1 Diagnostic Criteria for Hematuria

| Type | Diagnostic Criterion | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Gross (visible) hematuria*** | ***Red, pink, or brown urine visible to naked eye*** confirmed by **centrifugation** (red sediment = RBCs present) [1] | ***Painless gross hematuria = MALIGNANCY UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE*** [1] |
| **Microscopic (non-visible) hematuria** | **≥ 3 RBC per HPF** in a centrifuged, properly collected urine specimen (freshly voided, clean-catch, midstream) [2][3] | Some guidelines require positivity on **2 out of 3** specimens to exclude transient causes [2] |

**Why centrifuge the urine?** Centrifugation separates formed elements (RBCs, WBCs, casts, crystals) from the liquid supernatant. If the **sediment** is red → RBCs are present → true hematuria. If the **supernatant** is red but sediment is clear → no intact RBCs → the colour is from dissolved pigment (haemoglobin, myoglobin, drugs). This simple step immediately separates true hematuria from pigmenturia [3].

#### 1.2 Confirming and Characterising Hematuria — The Dipstick-Microscopy-Morphology Triad

| Step | Test | What It Tells You | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Step 1** | **Urine dipstick** | Screening — detects the peroxidase activity of the haem moiety | +ve for "blood" (but cannot distinguish RBCs vs free Hb vs myoglobin) |
| **Step 2** | **Urine microscopy** (centrifuged specimen) | ***Confirms true hematuria*** and begins to localise source | ***≥ 3 RBC/HPF*** confirms hematuria; pyuria ( > 5 WBC/HPF) suggests infection [5] |
| **Step 3** | **RBC morphology assessment** (phase-contrast microscopy) | ***Glomerular vs non-glomerular*** — the most important branch point | ***Dysmorphic RBCs / acanthocytes / RBC casts → glomerular; Isomorphic RBCs ± clots → non-glomerular*** [3][5] |

<Callout title="Why Dysmorphic RBCs Indicate Glomerular Bleeding">
RBCs forced through small rents in a damaged GBM undergo **mechanical trauma** (deformed by the narrow passage) and then **osmotic trauma** as they travel through nephron segments with widely varying tonicity (from ~300 mOsm/kg in the proximal tubule to ~1200 mOsm/kg in the inner medulla and back). This dual insult produces characteristic **acanthocytes** — ring-shaped cells with vesicle-shaped protrusions (blebs). Finding > 5% acanthocytes among urinary RBCs has ~80% specificity for glomerular bleeding [3].

**RBC casts** are even more specific — they form when RBCs are trapped within Tamm-Horsfall protein (uromodulin) secreted by thick ascending limb cells. The cast takes the cylindrical shape of the tubular lumen. ***RBC casts are diagnostic of glomerulonephritis*** [3].
</Callout>

### 2. Key Urine Microscopy Findings and Their Interpretation

| Finding | Interpretation | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| ***Dysmorphic RBCs (acanthocytes)*** | ***Glomerular haematuria*** | Mechanical + osmotic trauma through damaged GBM and nephron [3] |
| ***RBC casts*** | ***Diagnostic of glomerulonephritis*** — pathognomonic for glomerular bleeding | RBCs trapped in Tamm-Horsfall protein within tubules [3] |
| ***Blood clots*** | ***ALWAYS non-glomerular*** | Heavy focal bleeding with sufficient fibrinogen; urokinase/tPA in glomeruli prevent clotting [3] |
| ***Isomorphic RBCs*** | ***Non-glomerular (urological) bleeding*** | RBCs shed directly into urinary tract without traversing GBM → retain normal shape [2][5] |
| **WBCs / pyuria ( > 5 WBC/HPF)** | Infection or inflammation | Neutrophil migration into urine in response to bacterial or inflammatory stimuli |
| **WBC casts** | Pyelonephritis or tubulointerstitial nephritis | WBCs trapped in tubular casts indicate intrarenal inflammation |
| **Granular / muddy brown casts** | Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) | Sloughed tubular epithelial cells degenerate within casts |
| **Sterile pyuria (WBCs but -ve culture)** | Renal TB, interstitial nephritis, partially treated UTI, ketamine cystitis | Inflammatory process without conventional bacterial growth on routine media [10] |
| **Crystals** | Urolithiasis (type depends on crystal morphology) | Supersaturation of specific solutes in urine |
| **Proteinuria (dipstick ≥ 1+ or UACR > 30 mg/mmol)** | Co-existent glomerular disease; quantify with spot UACR or 24h collection | GBM damage allows protein filtration alongside RBCs |

### 3. The Complete Investigation Panel

Once true hematuria is confirmed and characterised as glomerular vs non-glomerular, specific investigations are deployed.

#### 3.1 Urine Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Key Points & Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| **Repeat dipstick** | Confirm persistence (transient hematuria is common — triggered by fever, exercise, infection, vaccination) [5] | If negative on repeat → resolved; but if risk factors for malignancy present, still consider workup |
| **Midstream urine (MSU) culture & sensitivity** | ***Exclude UTI*** — ALL patients should have culture before evaluation of hematuria [3] | +ve culture → treat, then re-evaluate; ***persistent hematuria after treating UTI requires further investigation*** [10] |
| **Early morning urine (EMU) × AFB** | ***Exclude urinary tract TB*** [5] | EMU has highest yield (concentrated, large volume); send on 3 consecutive mornings; indicated when sterile pyuria found [10] |
| ***Urine cytology*** | ***Detect malignant urothelial cells, especially high-grade TCC and carcinoma in situ (CIS)*** | ***Overall sensitivity ~50% (low for low-grade, ~64% for high-grade); very specific ( > 98%)*** [3][5]; ***requires fresh urine (cells degrade), as much volume as possible; avoid first-void EMU (↑epithelial cells — use 2nd void on 3 consecutive days)*** [5]; Interpretation: ***normal / atypical / suspicious / malignant*** [3][5]; ***atypical cytology can occur in UTI → repeat in a few weeks*** [5] |
| **Urine protein quantification** (spot UACR or 24h urine protein) | Quantify proteinuria — supports glomerular origin if significant ( > 1 g/day) | Guides need for nephrology referral and renal biopsy [8] |
| **Urine-based biomarkers** (e.g. FISH for aneuploidy 3, 7, 17 and 9p21 deletion) | ↑Sensitivity for early recurrence of urothelial CA | ***Rarely done in HK*** [5]; may complement cytology in intermediate-risk patients |

<Callout title="Urine Cytology — What It Can and Can't Do" type="idea">
***Urine cytology is ONLY useful for detecting high-grade TCC and CIS*** — it picks up abnormal cells floating off a poorly differentiated tumour surface. Low-grade papillary tumours shed cells that look almost normal → cytology misses them. This is why ***cytology can NEVER replace cystoscopy*** for diagnosing bladder cancer [5]. Think of cytology as a "surveillance net" that catches the most aggressive fish but lets the smaller ones through.
</Callout>

#### 3.2 Blood Investigations

| Investigation | Purpose | Key Findings |
|---|---|---|
| **CBC with differential** | Anaemia (chronic blood loss or malignancy); leukocytosis (infection); thrombocytopenia (bleeding disorder) [5] | NcNc anaemia → chronic disease/malignancy; microcytic → iron deficiency from chronic blood loss |
| **Clotting profile (PT/APTT)** | Screen for bleeding diathesis; pre-operative baseline [3] | Prolonged APTT → haemophilia; prolonged PT → liver disease or warfarin |
| **RFT (urea, creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes)** | Assess renal function; detect renal impairment; U:Cr ratio guides pre-renal vs intrinsic | ↑Cr with U:Cr ratio > 100:1 suggests pre-renal; ↑Cr suggests parenchymal disease or post-renal obstruction [5] |
| **Serum calcium and phosphate** | Hypercalcaemia → hyperparathyroidism (stone disease), RCC (PTHrP), myeloma | Raised calcium + low phosphate → primary hyperPTH; raised calcium + raised ALP → bone metastasis |
| **Serum uric acid** | Hyperuricaemia → uric acid stones, gout, myeloproliferative disorders | > 0.45 mmol/L in males suggests hyperuricaemia |
| **Serum PSA** (males > 50, or if prostatic symptoms/nodule) | ***Prostate-specific but NOT prostate-cancer specific*** [3] | ***PSA < 4 ng/mL = normal; PSA 4–10 = 20% chance cancer; PSA ≥ 10 = 50% chance cancer*** [3]; also raised in prostatitis, BPH, post-biopsy |
| **ESR / CRP** | Non-specific markers of inflammation | ↑ESR in GN, vasculitis, malignancy; CRP usually NOT elevated in active SLE (unless infection, serositis, or arthritis) [8] |

##### Serology Panel (If Glomerular Hematuria Suspected)

This is the "nephrological battery" — each test targets a specific disease mechanism [5][8]:

| Test | Target Disease | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Serum complement (C3/C4)*** | ***↓C3/C4 → immune complex-mediated GN*** (MPGN, PSGN, lupus nephritis, cryoglobulinaemia, infective endocarditis); ***Normal C3/C4 → non-IC GN*** (IgAN, Goodpasture, ANCA vasculitis, PAN) [5][8] | C3/C4 is **the first branch point** in the nephrological workup |
| **ANA** | Screening for SLE | Highly sensitive but low specificity; proceed to anti-dsDNA if +ve |
| **Anti-dsDNA** | Lupus nephritis (active disease) | Titre correlates with disease activity; ↑anti-dsDNA + ↓C3/C4 = active lupus nephritis [8] |
| **ANCA (c-ANCA / PR3, p-ANCA / MPO)** | ANCA-associated vasculitis | c-ANCA/PR3 → GPA; p-ANCA/MPO → MPA or EGPA [5][8] |
| **Anti-GBM antibody** | Anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture syndrome) | +ve = diagnostic; linear IgG on renal IF confirms |
| **ASO titre (anti-streptolysin O)** | Post-streptococcal GN | ↑titre confirms recent streptococcal infection [5][8] |
| **Anti-HCV, HBsAg/HBV DNA** | HBV/HCV-associated MPGN, PAN | Guide treatment (antivirals + immunosuppression) [5][8] |
| **Cryoglobulins (cryocrit)** | Cryoglobulinaemia (often HCV-associated) | Indicated when HCV +ve or clinical features suggestive |
| **Blood cultures** | Infective endocarditis (immune complex GN) | Indicated when persistent fever + new murmur + hematuria |
| **Serum/urine protein electrophoresis** | Multiple myeloma, amyloidosis | Paraprotein band on SPE; light chains in urine |

#### 3.3 Imaging — Upper Urinary Tract

***The lecture slide [1] states that the hematuria workup for suspected upper tract pathology comprises: CTU + Flexible cystoscopy*** [1].

| Modality | What It Detects | Advantages | Disadvantages | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***CT Urogram (CTU)*** — the gold standard for upper tract imaging [3][5] | ***Renal masses, urinary tract calculi, pelvicalyceal and ureteric TCC*** | ***Higher sensitivity and specificity than any other modality***; 3 phases capture all pathology [3] | Radiation; contrast nephrotoxicity; contrast allergy | ***Standard upper tract imaging in hematuria workup*** [3][5]; ***AUA high-risk group*** [1] |
| **Non-contrast CT (NCCT)** | Urinary stones (level, size, density, degree of obstruction) | No contrast needed; fast; highly sensitive for stones (~95%) [5] | Misses soft tissue lesions; radiation | When clinical suspicion is predominantly for ureteric stones (flank colic) |
| **USG kidneys** | Hydronephrosis, renal masses, cysts, bladder lesions (if large), prostate size | Non-invasive; no radiation; bedside; cheap; safe in pregnancy [3][5] | ***Cannot visualise the whole ureter*** (only proximal and distal ends); misses small urothelial lesions [2][5] | ***AUA intermediate-risk group***; pregnancy; children; screening |
| **MR Urogram (MRU)** | Upper tract anatomy; soft tissue characterisation | ***No radiation*** → safe for pregnancy, children, contrast allergy [5] | ***Less able to detect smaller urothelial lesions and non-obstructing stones***; expensive; motion artefact (kidney is a moving organ) [3][5] | ***C/I to iodinated contrast*** (allergy, renal impairment); pregnancy |
| **IV Urogram (IVU)** | Upper tract anatomy (filling defects, hydronephrosis, renal outline) | Economic; good for detecting upper tract lesions | ***Largely replaced by CTU***; insensitive for renal lesions < 3 cm; cannot detect small bladder lesions [3][5] | Limited role: trauma (5-min IVU) or when CT unavailable |
| **Retrograde pyelogram** | Ureteric and pelvicalyceal anatomy when contrast cannot be excreted | Direct contrast injection via cystoscopy → independent of renal function [3][5] | Invasive; requires cystoscopy; risk of infection | Insufficient renal function for CTU; persistent filling defect needing clarification |
| **KUB (plain AXR)** | Radio-opaque stones; kidney shadow; psoas shadow loss | Quick; cheap; no contrast | ***NOT commonly performed*** now; misses radiolucent stones (uric acid, xanthine); low sensitivity overall [3][5] | Initial screening only; follow-up of known radio-opaque stones |

##### CT Urogram (CTU) — Three Phases Explained

***CTU has three phases***, each designed to detect a specific category of pathology [5]:

| Phase | Timing | What It Detects | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Non-contrast phase** | Before contrast injection | ***Urinary stones*** | Stones are high-density structures that are best seen without contrast (contrast can obscure them) |
| **Nephrographic (parenchymal) phase** | ~100 seconds post-contrast | ***Renal masses (RCC, AML)*** | Contrast enhances the renal parenchyma — tumours enhance differently from normal tissue (RCC classically enhances then washes out) |
| **Excretory (delayed) phase** | 5–15 minutes post-contrast | ***Urothelial lesions (TCC of renal pelvis, ureter)*** | Contrast is excreted into the collecting system → fills pelvicalyceal system and ureters → filling defects indicate tumour or blood clot |

#### 3.4 Imaging — Lower Urinary Tract (Cystoscopy)

***Cystoscopy is the investigation of choice for the lower urinary tract*** [5]. It is the **only** modality that allows direct visualisation of the urethra, prostate, and the **entire bladder** for malignancy and identification of the bleeding source [3].

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Types** | ***Flexible cystoscopy*** (16 Fr; under LA in outpatient setting); ***Rigid cystoscopy*** (under GA; allows washout, biopsy, TURBT) [2][5] |
| **Indication** | ***Should be done in ALL patients with gross non-glomerular hematuria*** — even if a stone is already found on KUB (because malignancy may coexist) [5] |
| **What it can detect** | ***Papillary TCC as small as 1 mm (missed by CT)***; CIS (flat velvety lesions); bladder stones; trabeculation (BOO); ureteric jet indicating upper tract bleeding source [5] |
| **Biopsy** | Allows tissue sampling for histopathology during the same procedure |
| **Ureteric jets** | Observing bloody efflux from one ureteric orifice → localises bleeding to that side's upper tract |
| **Limitations** | Cannot evaluate upper tract; requires patient cooperation (or GA for rigid scope) |

<Callout title="Key Principle" type="error">
***Despite advancing imaging and urine biomarkers, non-invasive tests alone CAN NEVER replace cystoscopy/TURBT for diagnosis of CA bladder*** [5]. A normal CT urogram does NOT exclude bladder cancer — small flat lesions (CIS) and tiny papillary tumours are invisible on cross-sectional imaging but readily seen at cystoscopy.
</Callout>

#### 3.5 Renal Biopsy (For Glomerular Hematuria)

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| **Indication** | Glomerular hematuria with risk factors for progressive disease: ***proteinuria > 1 g/day, rising serum creatinine, active sediment with persistent hematuria*** [3][5][8] |
| **What it provides** | Light microscopy (LM), immunofluorescence (IF), electron microscopy (EM) — the "triple stain" that gives definitive diagnosis |
| **Most common biopsy findings** in isolated glomerular hematuria | ***IgA nephropathy, Alport syndrome (hereditary nephritis), thin BM disease, non-specific GN*** [3] |
| **IF patterns** | Mesangial IgA (IgAN); linear IgG (anti-GBM); granular IgG/C3 ("lumpy-bumpy" = post-infectious GN, lupus); pauci-immune (ANCA vasculitis) |
| **Contraindications** | ***Bleeding diathesis, severe uncontrolled HTN, solitary kidney, small kidneys (chronic irreversible disease), hydronephrosis, renal/perirenal infection*** [3] |
| **When NOT needed** | Very small kidneys on USG (indicates end-stage scarring — biopsy won't change management); high clinical probability of a specific subtype (e.g. ↓↓C3/C4 + recurrent glomerular hematuria → treat empirically as proliferative lupus nephritis) [5] |

#### 4.2 AUA Risk-Stratified Approach for Microscopic Hematuria

***Directly from the lecture slides [1]:***

| ***Risk Category*** | ***Criteria*** | ***Workup*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Low/Negligible-Risk*** (ALL of the following) | ***Women < 60, Men < 40; Never smoker or < 10 pack-years; 3–10 RBC/HPF on one UA; No additional risk factors for urothelial cancer*** | ***Repeat UA within 6 months*** |
| ***Intermediate-Risk*** (ONE or more) | ***Women ≥ 60, Men 40–59; 10–30 pack-years; 11–25 RBC/HPF on one UA; ≥ 1 additional risk factor for urothelial cancer; Previously low/negligible-risk with no prior evaluation and 3–25 RBC/HPF on repeat UA*** | ***Cystoscopy and renal ultrasound; Clinicians may offer urine cytology or validated urine-based tumour markers (UBTMs) to facilitate decision regarding cystoscopy; Repeat UA within 12 months if cystoscopy not performed*** |
| ***High-Risk*** (ONE or more) | ***Men ≥ 60; > 30 pack-years; > 25 RBC/HPF on one UA; History of gross hematuria; ≥ 1 additional risk factor for urothelial cancer plus any high-risk feature*** | ***Cystoscopy and axial upper tract imaging (CT urogram)*** |

> ***Note from the lecture slide: Women should not be categorised as high-risk based on age alone*** [1]. This reflects the lower baseline incidence of bladder cancer in women.

#### 4.3 Gross Hematuria — Immediate Workup

***All patients with gross hematuria*** require urgent evaluation regardless of risk factors:
- ***Cystoscopy*** (mandatory — even if stone found on imaging) [5]
- ***Upper tract imaging*** — CTU is standard [1][3]
- ***Urine cytology × 3*** [5]
- ***If cystoscopy negative but cytology positive → suspect upper tract TCC → CT urogram or ureteroscopy*** [5]

***For upper tract TCC specifically, the lecture slide [1] states: "Hematuria work up: CTU + Flexible cystoscopy; Ureteroscopy + biopsy"*** [1].

#### 4.4 When to Refer to Nephrology vs Urology

***The following conditions warrant nephrology referral*** [5]:

| Referral to Nephrology | Reason |
|---|---|
| Urological cause excluded by cystoscopy + imaging | Glomerular origin likely |
| Evidence of ↓GFR or CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min) | Renal parenchymal disease requires nephrological management |
| Significant proteinuria (UACR > 30 mg/mmol or > 500 mg/day) | Suggests glomerular pathology |
| Young patient ( < 40 y) with HTN and isolated hematuria | May indicate early glomerular disease requiring biopsy |
| Visible hematuria with intercurrent URTI | Suggests IgA nephropathy |

***If urological cancer is ruled out and no glomerular features → treat as CKD: monitor RFT and urinalysis yearly*** [2].

### 5. Approach to Glomerulonephritis Workup — The Complement-Serology Framework

When glomerular hematuria is confirmed, the ***complement level is the key initial branch point*** [5][8]:

```mermaid

    A["Glomerular hematuria confirmed"] --> B["Check serum C3/C4"]
    B -->|"Low C3 and/or C4"| C["Immune complex-mediated GN"]
    B -->|"Normal C3/C4"| D["Non-immune complex GN"]
    
    C --> C1["Check ANA, anti-dsDNA → Lupus nephritis"]
    C --> C2["Check ASO titre → Post-streptococcal GN"]
    C --> C3["Check anti-HCV, cryocrit → MPGN / Cryoglobulinaemia"]

    D --> D4["Check serum IgA → Elevated in 50% of IgAN"]
    
    C --> E["Renal biopsy for definitive diagnosis and classification"]
    D --> E
```

| Complement Level | Differential Diagnoses | Key Serological Tests |
|---|---|---|
| ***↓C3/C4*** | ***MPGN, PSGN, lupus nephritis, cryoglobulinaemia, infective endocarditis, shunt nephritis*** [5][8] | ANA, anti-dsDNA, ASO titre, anti-HCV/HBV, cryocrit, blood cultures |
| ***Normal C3/C4*** | ***IgA nephropathy, Goodpasture (anti-GBM), HSP/IgA vasculitis, ANCA-associated vasculitis (GPA, MPA, EGPA), PAN*** [5][8] | ANCA (c-ANCA/PR3, p-ANCA/MPO), anti-GBM antibody |

### 6. Summary of Investigation Findings by Diagnosis

| Diagnosis | Urine Microscopy | Urine Culture | Cytology | Key Blood Test | Key Imaging | Gold Standard |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **UTI** | WBCs, bacteria, ± RBCs | +ve (specific organism) | Not indicated | CBC (↑WBC) | Not usually needed (USG if complicated) | Urine C/ST |
| **Bladder cancer** | Isomorphic RBCs ± clots | -ve | ***Suspicious/Malignant (esp. high-grade/CIS)*** | — | CTU (filling defect) | ***Cystoscopy + TURBT + biopsy*** [5] |
| **RCC** | Isomorphic RBCs | -ve | May show malignant cells | ↑Ca, ↑EPO, ↑LDH | ***CTU (enhancing renal mass)*** | CT-guided biopsy or surgical excision |
| **Upper tract TCC** | Isomorphic RBCs | -ve | May show malignant cells | — | ***CTU (filling defect in ureter/pelvis)*** | ***Ureteroscopy + biopsy*** [1] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Step 1 — Confirm true hematuria:** Centrifuge → red sediment = true hematuria; red supernatant + dipstick +ve = haemoglobinuria/myoglobinuria; red supernatant + dipstick -ve = drug/food/porphyria.

**Step 2 — Characterise:** Urine microscopy → dysmorphic RBCs / RBC casts = glomerular → nephrology. Isomorphic RBCs ± clots = non-glomerular → urology.

**Step 3 — Exclude UTI first** (MSU C/ST). If hematuria persists after treating UTI → full workup.

**Step 4 — Risk stratify** (AUA 2020 for microscopic hematuria): Low → repeat UA in 6 months; Intermediate → cystoscopy + renal USG; High → cystoscopy + CT urogram.

**Gross hematuria:** Always gets full workup — cystoscopy + CTU ± urine cytology × 3.

**CTU has 3 phases:** Non-contrast (stones), nephrographic (renal masses), excretory (urothelial lesions).

**Cystoscopy:** Only modality that can detect papillary TCC as small as 1 mm and CIS. Non-invasive tests CANNOT replace cystoscopy for bladder CA diagnosis.

**Urine cytology:** High specificity ( > 98%) but low sensitivity (~50% overall); best for high-grade TCC and CIS; send fresh, 2nd void, 3 consecutive days.

**Glomerular workup:** Complement (C3/C4) is the branch point → ↓complement = IC-mediated GN (lupus, PSGN, MPGN); normal complement = non-IC GN (IgAN, ANCA vasculitis, anti-GBM). Renal biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

**Renal biopsy indications:** Proteinuria > 1 g/day, rising creatinine, active sediment with persistent hematuria.

**Refer to nephrology when:** Urological cause excluded, ↓GFR, significant proteinuria, young + HTN + isolated hematuria, visible hematuria with URTI.

Intermediate risk (women >=60, men 40-59, 10-30 pack-years, 11-25 RBC/HPF, >=1 risk factor): cystoscopy + renal ultrasound, may offer urine cytology or UBTMs. High risk (men >=60, >30 pack-years, >25 RBC/HPF, history of gross hematuria, risk factors + high-risk feature): cystoscopy + axial upper tract imaging (CT urogram)."

      question: "A patient with hematuria has sterile pyuria on urine microscopy. What three diagnoses must you consider and what specific investigation is needed for each?",
      markscheme: "1) Renal/urinary tract TB: send early morning urine (EMU) x3 for AFB smear and culture. 2) Urolithiasis (especially with urease-producing organisms): NCCT for stones. 3) Ketamine cystitis: drug history for ketamine use; cystoscopy may show contracted bladder. Also consider partially treated UTI (repeat culture), interstitial nephritis (drug history, eosinophiluria), and interstitial cystitis (diagnosis of exclusion)."
