## Differential Diagnosis of Hematuria

The differential diagnosis of hematuria is best approached **systematically by anatomical site** — you mentally walk along the urinary tract from the glomerulus to the urethral meatus and ask: "Could the blood be coming from here?" At each level you consider benign vs malignant, medical vs surgical. Overlaid on this anatomical framework is the **glomerular vs non-glomerular** distinction, which is the single most important initial branch point because it determines whether the patient needs a nephrologist or a urologist.

---

### 1. The Master Framework: Glomerular vs Non-Glomerular

Before diving into individual causes, let's revisit **why** this distinction matters from first principles:

- **Glomerular bleeding** → blood leaks across a damaged glomerular basement membrane (GBM). RBCs are forced through tiny rents under filtration pressure → they become **dysmorphic** (distorted, with blebs and irregular membranes). They then travel the full length of the nephron, getting exposed to varying osmolalities and urokinase/tPA → **no clots form**. The blood mixes with a large volume of filtrate → urine appears **brown/cola-coloured** (haemoglobin oxidises to methaemoglobin). Proteinuria is usually co-present because the same barrier that blocks protein is disrupted [3][5].

- **Non-glomerular (urological) bleeding** → blood enters the urinary tract downstream of the glomerulus (renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, prostate, urethra). RBCs are shed directly into urine as **whole blood** → they retain their normal **isomorphic** shape. If bleeding is brisk, there is enough fibrinogen and minimal fibrinolytic activity → **clots can form**. Urine is typically **bright red or pink** [2][3].

### 2. Comprehensive Differential Diagnosis by Anatomical Site

The table below integrates the ***lecture slide classification [1]*** with the expanded framework from senior notes [3][5][7]. Each cause includes its **distinguishing clinical features** so you can narrow the differential at the bedside.

#### 2.1 Upper Urinary Tract — Kidney

##### A. Glomerular Causes

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| **IgA nephropathy** (commonest GN worldwide; commonest cause of isolated glomerular hematuria) | ***Synpharyngitic hematuria*** — gross hematuria concurrent with or 1–3 days after URTI (cf. post-streptococcal GN = 2–3 weeks later); usually adult onset; may have flank pain + AKI during episodes [7][8] | IgA immune complexes deposit in mesangium → mesangial proliferation + complement activation → GBM damage → RBCs leak through |
| **Thin basement membrane disease** (benign familial hematuria) | Persistent microscopic hematuria; **AD** inheritance (COL4A3/4 mutations); **benign** course with normal renal function; FHx of hematuria in 30–50%; gross hematuria unusual ( < 10%) [8] | GBM is uniformly thin ( < 250 nm vs normal 300–400 nm) → mechanically weaker → allows RBC passage under normal filtration pressures |
| **Alport syndrome** | X-linked dominant (80%); progressive hematuria + **sensorineural hearing loss** + **anterior lenticonus** + dot-and-fleck retinopathy; progressive CKD especially in males; FHx of renal failure/deafness in male relatives [8] | Defective type IV collagen (α3/α4/α5 chains) → GBM progressively splits, lamellates ("basket-weave" on EM) → structural failure → hematuria + proteinuria |
| **Post-infectious GN** (post-streptococcal) | Nephritic syndrome (HTN, oedema, oliguria, hematuria) 2–3 weeks after Group A Strep pharyngitis or 3–6 weeks after skin infection; ↓C3, ↑ASO titre; **children > adults** | Subepithelial immune complex "humps" → complement activation → endocapillary proliferation → GBM damage |
| **Lupus nephritis** | Multisystem disease: malar rash, arthralgia, serositis, oral ulcers; young F >> M; ↑ANA, ↑anti-dsDNA, ↓C3/C4 | Anti-dsDNA immune complexes deposit in glomeruli → proliferative or membranous GN → GBM disruption |
| **ANCA-associated vasculitis** (GPA, MPA, EGPA) | ***Pulmonary-renal syndrome*** (haemoptysis + RPGN); GPA → saddle nose, nasal crusting, epistaxis; constitutional symptoms; ↑c-ANCA (PR3) in GPA, ↑p-ANCA (MPO) in MPA [2] | Pauci-immune necrotising crescentic GN → fibrinoid necrosis of glomerular capillaries → hematuria |
| **Anti-GBM disease** (Goodpasture syndrome) | Pulmonary haemorrhage + RPGN; young male smokers; anti-GBM Ab +ve; linear IgG on IF | AutoAb against α3 chain of type IV collagen in GBM → complement-mediated destruction → crescentic GN |
| **HSP/IgA vasculitis** | Children: palpable purpura (lower limbs/buttocks) + arthralgia + abdominal pain + GN; essentially systemic IgA nephropathy | IgA deposition in mesangium (same mechanism as IgA nephropathy) + small vessel vasculitis |
| **Mesangiocapillary GN (MPGN)** | Nephritic/nephrotic overlap; may be secondary to HCV, cryoglobulinaemia; persistently ↓C3 | Immune complex or complement-mediated thickening + splitting of GBM ("tram-track" on LM) |

##### B. Tubular, Interstitial and Vascular Renal Causes (Non-Glomerular but Renal)

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| ***Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)*** [1] | Traditional triad: painless hematuria + flank pain + palpable mass (only ~10%); constitutional symptoms; paraneoplastic: HTN (renin), hypercalcaemia (PTHrP), polycythaemia (EPO); ***left-sided varicocele*** (L renal vein obstruction); most now found incidentally on imaging [5] | Tumour invades renal collecting system → erodes into vascular channels → whole blood enters urine |
| ***Polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)*** [1] | Bilateral ballotable kidneys; insidious HTN; FHx (AD); associated liver cysts; berry aneurysms | Cyst rupture into collecting system; cyst haemorrhage; also predisposes to stones |
| ***Angiomyolipoma (AML)*** [1] | Often associated with **tuberous sclerosis** (bilateral, multiple) or sporadic (unilateral); fat-containing mass on CT; risk of spontaneous haemorrhage if > 4 cm | Abnormal blood vessels within tumour lack elastic lamina → aneurysm formation → spontaneous rupture |
| ***Infection — pyelonephritis*** [1] | High fever, rigors, vomiting, loin pain, tenderness at renal angle; WBC casts on microscopy | Intense inflammation of renal parenchyma → mucosal hyperaemia, capillary disruption → blood enters collecting system |
| **Renal abscess** | Similar to pyelonephritis but more indolent; swinging fever; may follow bacteraemia (S. aureus) | Suppurative destruction of renal tissue → erosion into collecting system |
| ***Renal TB*** | Sterile pyuria (WBCs on microscopy but negative routine culture); constitutional symptoms; calcified "putty kidney"; exposure history | Caseous necrosis destroys renal parenchyma → cavities communicate with collecting system |
| ***Trauma*** [1] | History of blunt/penetrating injury or iatrogenic (biopsy, lithotripsy) | Direct mechanical disruption of renal parenchyma/vessels |
| **Renal artery embolism / infarction** [3] | Acute flank pain; ↑LDH; AF or endocarditis as embolic source | Tissue necrosis → haemorrhagic infarction → blood enters collecting system |
| **Renal vein thrombosis** [3] | Flank pain; proteinuria; a/w nephrotic syndrome (esp. membranous nephropathy) | Venous congestion → haemorrhagic infarction |
| **AV malformation** [3] | Recurrent gross hematuria; may have renal bruit; can cause high-output cardiac failure if large | Abnormal high-pressure arteriovenous communication → rupture into collecting system |
| **Papillary necrosis** | Risk factors: DM, NSAIDs, sickle cell, analgesic nephropathy; colicky pain as sloughed papillae pass | Ischaemic necrosis of renal papillae → necrotic tissue + blood shed into calyceal system |
| **Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)** | Drug rash + eosinophilia + AKI; common culprits: penicillins, cephalosporins, NSAIDs, PPIs | Inflammatory infiltrate (eosinophils, lymphocytes) in interstitium → disruption of peritubular capillaries → hematuria; eosinophiluria is characteristic |
| **Medullary sponge kidney** | Often incidental; recurrent stones + hematuria; characteristic "paintbrush" appearance on IVU | Dilated collecting ducts → stasis → stone formation + mucosal erosion |
| **Sickle cell disease/trait** | Known sickle cell status; can cause painless gross hematuria even in carriers (trait) | Sickling in vasa recta of hypertonic renal medulla → papillary necrosis + microvascular occlusion |

#### 2.2 Upper Urinary Tract — Ureter

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| ***Stone*** [1] | Acute colicky loin-to-groin pain (ureteric colic); N/V; restlessness (patients can't keep still); stones lodge at PUJ, pelvic brim, VUJ [4] | Stone mechanically abrades urothelial lining as it passes or impacts → mucosal injury → hematuria |
| ***Urothelial carcinoma (TCC)*** [1] | ***Field cancerization*** → may be multifocal; risk factors same as bladder CA (smoking, chemicals, aristolochic acid); often painless hematuria or clot colic if bleeding produces vermiform clots [3] | Malignant urothelium is friable + highly vascular → bleeds readily |

#### 2.3 Lower Urinary Tract — Bladder

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bladder cancer*** [1] | ***Most common malignancy of the urinary system***; M:F = 3:1; median age 70; ***painless gross hematuria*** is the hallmark; irritative LUTS (frequency, urgency) especially with CIS; ***field cancerization concept — multifocal occurrence is characteristic*** [3] | Malignant urothelium is friable and richly vascularised → bleeds easily, often intermittently |
| ***Infection (cystitis)*** [1] | Dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain; turbid/foul-smelling urine; +ve urine C/ST | Inflammation of bladder mucosa → mucosal hyperaemia and erosion |
| ***Bladder stone*** [1] | Often secondary to BOO (BPH, neurogenic bladder); suprapubic pain worse at end of micturition; interruption of stream (stone rolls over bladder neck) | Mechanical abrasion of bladder mucosa by stone |
| ***Irradiation cystitis*** [1] | ***Usually delayed for a few years*** after pelvic irradiation (cervical CA, colorectal CA) [5] | Radiation-induced obliterative endarteritis → mucosal ischaemia → telangiectasia → bleeding |
| **Haemorrhagic cystitis** | Haematological malignancy patients on chemo; **cyclophosphamide / ifosfamide**; **BK virus** in immunocompromised [5] | Acrolein metabolite (cyclophosphamide) is directly toxic to urothelium; BK virus causes viral cytopathic effect in urothelium |
| **Schistosomiasis** (rare in HK, but consider in travellers) | Travel to endemic area (Africa, Middle East); terminal hematuria; calcified bladder on AXR | S. haematobium eggs deposit in bladder wall → chronic granulomatous inflammation → squamous metaplasia → SCC of bladder |
| **Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome** | Chronic suprapubic pain, frequency, urgency; sterile urine; diagnosis of exclusion | Defective urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer → increased permeability → inflammation → submucosal petechiae (glomerulations) |

#### 2.4 Prostate

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| ***BPH*** [1] | ***Advanced age***; obstructive LUTS (hesitancy, weak stream, straining, terminal dribbling, incomplete emptying); smooth enlarged prostate on DRE; hematuria is usually diagnosis by exclusion [5] | Hyperplastic tissue has ↑vascularity (especially periurethral submucosal veins); venous congestion → fragile vessels bleed; terminal hematuria |
| ***Prostate cancer*** [1] | Obstructive LUTS; hard, nodular, irregular prostate on DRE; ↑PSA; bone pain if metastatic | Locally advanced tumour invades bladder neck/urethra → vascular erosion |
| **Prostatitis** | Perineal pain; dysuria; fever (acute bacterial); tender boggy prostate on DRE | Prostatic inflammation → mucosal hyperaemia → hematuria (usually microscopic) |

#### 2.5 Urethra

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| ***Infection (urethritis)*** [1] | Urethral discharge; dysuria; initial-stream hematuria; STI history (gonorrhoea, chlamydia) [9] | Mucosal inflammation and erosion of urethral epithelium |
| ***Urethral cancer*** (rare) [1] | Palpable urethral mass; bloody urethral discharge; obstructive symptoms | Malignant erosion of urethral mucosa |
| **Urethral trauma** | History of pelvic fracture (membranous urethra) or straddle injury (bulbar urethra); blood at urethral meatus; high-riding prostate | Direct mechanical disruption of urethral wall |
| **Urethral stricture** | History of prior urethral trauma, instrumentation, or STI; progressive obstructive LUTS | Strictured mucosa is friable + associated with chronic inflammation |

#### 2.6 Systemic / Haematological Causes

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleeding disorders** (haemophilia, thrombocytopenia, DIC) | Other bleeding manifestations (bruising, GI bleed, gum bleeding); ***seldom causes hematuria on its own — 81% associated with underlying urinary cause*** [5] | Deficient coagulation → spontaneous mucosal bleeding in urinary tract |
| ***Anticoagulants / antiplatelets*** | ***NOT a satisfactory explanation for hematuria except in warfarin OD*** — these drugs unmask underlying lesions [2] | Lower threshold for an existing lesion to bleed, not a primary cause |

#### 2.7 Miscellaneous / Functional Causes

| Cause | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Causes Hematuria |
|---|---|---|
| ***Exercise-induced hematuria*** | ***Follows strenuous exercise; resolves after rest; diagnosis by exclusion*** [5] | Friction abrasion of collapsed bladder during running with dehydration; also renal vasoconstriction during exercise |
| **Benign idiopathic hematuria** | May be a/w exercise, febrile illness, vaccination; may be familial; ***diagnosis by exclusion*** [5] | Unknown; possibly transient glomerular or tubular capillary leak during physiological stress |
| **Nutcracker syndrome** | Left flank pain + hematuria in thin young adults; diagnosed by Doppler USG or CT angiography | Left renal vein compressed between aorta and SMA → venous hypertension → thin-walled collaterals rupture into collecting system |
| **Loin pain-hematuria syndrome** | Recurrent severe flank pain + hematuria; normal renal function; diagnosis of exclusion | Poorly understood; possibly renal microvascular — arteriolar C3 deposition or renal vein varicosities |
| **Endometriosis of urinary tract** | Cyclical hematuria coinciding with menses | Ectopic endometrial tissue on bladder/ureter bleeds under hormonal influence |
| **Factitious / Munchausen** | Inconsistent history; recurrent unexplained episodes; no pathology found | Self-induced bleeding or contamination of sample |

### 3. The "Most Common" and "Most Worrying" — Exam Favourites

***The senior notes [2] summarise this perfectly:***

> - ***Most common cause of hematuria: UTI (~60%)***
> - ***Most worrying cause: malignancy (until proven otherwise)***
> - ***Others: stone (~10%), GN (~5%), BPH, trauma, iatrogenic (e.g. post-TURP, post-FC)***

<Callout title="Red Flags in the UTI Setting" type="error">
***The UTI lecture slide [10] highlights three critical "red flags":***

1. ***"Recurrent" UTI with gross hematuria or persistent microscopic hematuria → formal urologist referral required to rule out malignancy (requires cystoscopic assessment)***
2. ***Recurrent bacterial persistence, especially with urease-producing organisms → may indicate underlying urolithiasis***
3. ***Recurrent UTI with pyuria but no growth → needs early morning urine for TB; rule out stone formation; consider ketamine cystitis***

Don't be lulled into complacency by a "simple UTI" — if hematuria persists after treating the infection, or if the pattern is atypical, there may be an underlying structural or malignant cause hiding behind the infection.
</Callout>

### 4. Differential Diagnosis by Clinical Presentation Pattern

This is how it works in practice. When you see a patient with hematuria, certain **clinical patterns** immediately narrow the list:

| Clinical Pattern | Most Likely Differentials | Key Discriminators |
|---|---|---|
| **Painless gross hematuria in an older adult ( > 35–40 y)** | ***Bladder cancer***, RCC, upper tract TCC, prostate cancer | ***Must exclude malignancy first***; smoking/occupational hx; cystoscopy + CT urogram mandatory [1][5] |
| **Painful hematuria + flank colic** | Ureteric stone, clot colic (from upper tract bleed), renal infarction | CT KUB for stones; restless patient (cf. peritonitis = still) |
| **Hematuria + dysuria + frequency + fever** | UTI (cystitis → pyelonephritis), prostatitis | Urine C/ST; treat, then re-check — if hematuria persists, investigate further [10] |
| **Hematuria + HTN + oedema + proteinuria** | Glomerulonephritis (nephritic syndrome) | Dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts; serology panel; renal biopsy |
| **Hematuria + haemoptysis** | ***Pulmonary-renal syndrome***: anti-GBM disease, ANCA vasculitis (GPA, MPA), SLE | Urgent — can be life-threatening; ANCA, anti-GBM, ANA; urgent renal biopsy [2] |
| **Hematuria + obstructive LUTS in elderly male** | BPH, prostate cancer | DRE; PSA; BPH is diagnosis by exclusion after malignancy ruled out |
| **Hematuria + bilateral flank masses + FHx** | ADPKD | USG: bilateral enlarged kidneys with multiple cysts |
| **Hematuria + sensorineural deafness** | Alport syndrome | FHx of renal failure in males; COL4A5 mutation; renal biopsy shows basket-weave GBM on EM |
| **Hematuria + purpura + arthralgia** | IgA vasculitis (HSP), SLE, ANCA vasculitis | Age (children → HSP; young women → SLE; older adults → ANCA vasculitis) |
| **Hematuria after strenuous exercise** | Exercise-induced hematuria | Resolves with rest; diagnosis of exclusion — still needs baseline workup |
| **Hematuria + sterile pyuria** | Renal TB, interstitial cystitis, ketamine cystitis | EMU for TB culture/PCR; consider drug history (ketamine) [10] |
| **Cyclical hematuria with menses** | Urinary tract endometriosis | Laparoscopy + cystoscopy |

---

### 5. Age-Based Differential Emphasis

The **pre-test probability** of each diagnosis shifts dramatically with age:

| Age Group | Most Likely Causes | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Children** | UTI, IgA vasculitis (HSP), post-infectious GN, congenital anomalies (VUR, Wilms' tumour), Alport syndrome, thin BM disease | Malignancy rare (except Wilms'); GN relatively more common |
| **Young adults (18–35)** | UTI, IgA nephropathy, thin BM disease, urolithiasis, exercise-induced, nutcracker syndrome | Malignancy uncommon but not impossible |
| **Adults (35–60)** | Urolithiasis, UTI, ***bladder cancer***, RCC, IgA nephropathy, BPH (men > 50) | Malignancy risk ↑↑ — must be actively excluded |
| **Elderly ( > 60)** | ***Bladder cancer***, prostate cancer, BPH, RCC, UTI, anticoagulant-unmasked lesions | ***Malignancy most likely*** until proven otherwise; BPH is diagnosis of exclusion [3][5] |

---

### 6. Pseudohematuria — "Not All Red Urine is Hematuria"

Always exclude these **before** launching into an expensive workup [3]:

| Cause | Mechanism | Dipstick | Microscopy |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Haemoglobinuria** | Intravascular haemolysis → free Hb filtered by kidney | +ve (haem) | **No RBCs** |
| **Myoglobinuria** | Rhabdomyolysis → myoglobin filtered | +ve (haem) | **No RBCs** |
| **Drugs** — rifampicin, phenazopyridine, phenytoin, nitrofurantoin | Pigmented metabolites excreted in urine | **-ve** | **No RBCs** |
| **Foods** — beetroot, blackberries | Anthocyanin pigments | **-ve** | **No RBCs** |
| **Porphyria** (acute intermittent) | Excess porphobilinogen → darkens on standing to port-wine | **-ve** | **No RBCs** |
| **Menstrual contamination** | Vaginal blood mixes with urine during collection | +ve (haem) | RBCs present (but not from urinary tract) |

<Callout title="Exam Tip" type="idea">
The dipstick peroxidase reaction detects the haem moiety — it cannot distinguish between intact RBCs (true hematuria), free haemoglobin (haemoglobinuria), and myoglobin (myoglobinuria). The key discriminator is **urine microscopy**: true hematuria has RBCs; haemoglobinuria and myoglobinuria do not. If dipstick is negative but urine is red, think drugs, food, or porphyria [3].

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Framework:** Always start with Glomerular vs Non-Glomerular → then sub-classify by anatomical site.

**Glomerular DDx (dysmorphic RBCs, RBC casts, proteinuria):** IgA nephropathy (most common), thin BM disease, Alport syndrome, post-infectious GN, lupus nephritis, ANCA vasculitis, anti-GBM disease.

**Non-glomerular DDx by site (isomorphic RBCs ± clots):**
- **Kidney:** RCC, AML, polycystic kidney, pyelonephritis, TB, renal infarction, papillary necrosis, trauma
- **Ureter:** Stone, TCC (field cancerization)
- **Bladder:** CA bladder (most common urinary malignancy), cystitis, stone, irradiation cystitis, haemorrhagic cystitis
- **Prostate:** BPH, CA prostate, prostatitis
- **Urethra:** Urethritis, trauma, urethral CA

**Most common cause:** UTI (~60%). **Most worrying:** Malignancy — painless gross hematuria in > 35 y/o = urothelial cancer until proven otherwise.

**Red flags in "recurrent UTI":** Persistent hematuria after treatment → must exclude malignancy with cystoscopy. Sterile pyuria → TB, ketamine cystitis. Recurrent urease-producing organisms → underlying stone.

**Bleeding disorders/anticoagulants:** NOT a satisfactory explanation — 81% have underlying urinary pathology. Always investigate.

**Pseudohematuria:** Haemoglobinuria, myoglobinuria (dipstick +ve, no RBCs), drugs/food (dipstick -ve, no RBCs).
