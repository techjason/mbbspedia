## Complications of Hematuria

Complications of hematuria can be divided into two broad categories:

1. **Complications of the hematuria itself** — i.e. what happens when blood is in the urine (regardless of cause)
2. **Complications of the underlying disease** — i.e. the consequences of the pathology causing the hematuria
3. **Complications of the investigation and treatment** — i.e. iatrogenic complications from the workup and management

Understanding complications from first principles means always asking: **"What does blood in the urinary tract physically do?"** and **"What does the underlying disease do to the body over time?"**

---

### 1. Complications of Hematuria Itself

These are the direct mechanical and physiological consequences of having blood in the urinary tract.

#### 1.1 Clot Retention — The Most Important Acute Complication

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Gross hematuria → blood pools in the bladder → coagulation occurs within the bladder lumen → **blood clots form** → clots obstruct the bladder neck or occlude the catheter → patient cannot void → **acute retention of urine (AROU)** [3] |
| **Why it matters** | A painfully distended bladder is a urological emergency. If not relieved, back-pressure transmits up the ureters → bilateral hydronephrosis → **obstructive AKI**. The distended bladder wall also becomes ischaemic, further worsening mucosal bleeding (a vicious cycle) |
| **Clinical features** | Suprapubic pain, inability to void, palpable/percussible distended bladder, agitation, tachycardia; if catheterised → catheter stops draining or only drains intermittently |
| **Management** | Large-bore 3-way catheter → manual clot evacuation (Toomey syringe) → continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) with NS; if fails → urgent rigid cystoscopy under GA for clot evacuation ± cauterisation [3][11] |

> **Why does clot retention cause a vicious cycle?** Overdistension of the bladder wall compresses the mucosal blood vessels → ischaemia → when decompression occurs, the ischaemic mucosa bleeds again (reperfusion injury) → more clots form → more retention.

#### 1.2 Anaemia

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic or recurrent hematuria → ongoing urinary loss of RBCs → **iron deficiency anaemia** (each mL of blood contains ~0.5 mg of iron; persistent losses deplete iron stores) [5][7] |
| **Clinical features** | ***Anaemic symptoms: pallor, palpitations, SOB, lightheadedness, malaise*** [5][7] |
| **Who is at risk** | Patients with chronic gross hematuria (e.g. advanced bladder cancer, large renal tumour, severe haemorrhagic cystitis, recurrent BPH-related hematuria); patients already on anticoagulants |
| **Management** | Oral iron supplementation; IV iron if intolerant or severe; blood transfusion if symptomatic or Hb < 70 g/L; always address the underlying cause |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl">
Always check a **CBC** in any patient with hematuria — even microscopic hematuria, if chronic, can lead to iron deficiency over time. The finding of unexplained iron deficiency anaemia in a patient with known microscopic hematuria should prompt you to think about an occult urological malignancy that is slowly oozing blood.
</Callout>

#### 1.3 Haemorrhagic Shock (Rare)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Massive hematuria (e.g. from RCC eroding into a major renal vessel, ruptured renal AML, post-procedural haemorrhage) → large-volume blood loss into the urinary tract → hypovolaemia → haemodynamic instability |
| **Why it is rare** | The urinary tract has a relatively low blood flow compared to the GI tract; most hematuria — even when dramatic-looking — involves modest actual blood loss (urine dilutes the blood, making it appear worse than it is). True haemodynamic instability from urinary blood loss is uncommon but does occur with large vascular tumours or post-surgical bleeding |
| **Management** | Resuscitation (IV fluids, blood transfusion); identify and stop the bleeding source (angioembolisation for renal bleeding, cystoscopic cauterisation for bladder bleeding, emergency surgery if refractory) |

#### 1.4 Ureteric Obstruction from Clots (Clot Colic)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Upper tract bleeding (e.g. from RCC, renal pelvis TCC, renal AVM) → blood clots form within the renal pelvis or ureter → **vermiform (worm-shaped) clots** travel down the ureter → obstruct at the natural narrowings (PUJ, pelvic brim, VUJ) → ureteric colic [3][5] |
| **Clinical features** | Indistinguishable from renal/ureteric colic caused by stones — colicky loin-to-groin pain, nausea, restlessness |
| **How to differentiate from stone** | CT KUB may show no radio-opaque stone (blood clots are isodense with soft tissue, not calcified); history of known renal tumour or haematological disorder; passage of dark "jelly-like" material |
| **Management** | Analgesia (NSAIDs); if persistent obstruction → JJ stent or PCN for decompression; treat the underlying upper tract bleeding source |

#### 1.5 Anxiety and Psychological Impact

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Seeing blood in the urine is extremely alarming for patients — many immediately fear cancer. Even after a negative workup, some patients develop health anxiety |
| **Why it matters** | Anxiety drives repeated presentations and over-investigation; conversely, patients who "normalise" their hematuria and delay seeking care risk late diagnosis of malignancy |
| **Management** | Clear, empathetic communication about what was found (or not found); explain the follow-up plan; reassure where appropriate but ensure the patient understands the need for ongoing surveillance |

---

### 2. Complications of the Underlying Cause of Hematuria

The specific complications depend on what is causing the hematuria. Here we focus on the most clinically important ones.

#### 2.1 Complications of Urological Malignancies

##### A. Bladder Cancer Complications [3][5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hydronephrosis and hydroureter*** | ***Invasive bladder tumours can cause distal ureteral obstruction and secondary hydronephrosis*** [3] | Leads to obstructive uropathy → progressive renal impairment if bilateral; unilateral obstruction may be asymptomatic |
| ***Local fistula formation*** | ***Extension of tumour to adjacent organs***; ***vesicocolic fistula → pneumaturia***; ***vesicovaginal fistula → incontinence*** [5] | Pneumaturia (passage of gas during urination) is almost pathognomonic for vesicocolic fistula; vesicovaginal fistula causes continuous urinary leakage per vagina |
| ***Metastatic disease*** | ***Haematogenous and lymphatic spread to liver, lung, bone, brain*** [3] | Bone pain (metastatic), jaundice (hepatic metastases), neurological deficits (brain metastases); heralds poor prognosis |
| **Recurrence** | ***Field cancerisation concept — multifocal occurrence is characteristic; secondary primary tumours can develop anywhere along the urothelium*** [3] | Mandates ***careful follow-up with cystoscopy and urine cytology beginning 3 months after initial treatment*** [3]; lifelong surveillance required |

##### B. RCC Complications [5]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **IVC tumour thrombus** | RCC characteristically extends into the renal vein → IVC → can extend to the right atrium. Thrombus can fragment → pulmonary embolism |
| **Paraneoplastic syndromes** | RCC is the "internist's tumour" — produces PTHrP (hypercalcaemia), EPO (polycythaemia), renin (HTN), IL-6 (Stauffer syndrome — hepatic dysfunction without metastasis) |
| **Metastatic disease** | Lung (most common), bone, liver, brain; "cannonball" metastases on CXR are classic for RCC |
| **Contralateral kidney involvement** | VHL patients may develop bilateral/multifocal tumours over time |

##### C. Prostate Cancer Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bone metastases** | Osteoblastic metastases (sclerotic on imaging — unlike most cancers which cause lytic lesions); lumbar spine, pelvis, femur most common → bone pain, pathological fractures, **spinal cord compression** (oncological emergency) |
| **Bladder outlet obstruction** | Local tumour growth obstructs the prostatic urethra → AROU → bilateral hydronephrosis → obstructive AKI |
| **Ureteric obstruction** | Locally advanced tumour or pelvic lymphadenopathy compresses ureters |

#### 2.2 Complications of Urolithiasis [3]

| Complication | Mechanism | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| ***Urosepsis*** | Obstruction above an infected urine → pus under pressure (pyonephrosis) → bacteraemia → sepsis → multi-organ failure | Urological emergency; mortality can be > 30% if not decompressed (PCN or JJ stent) and treated with IV antibiotics urgently |
| ***Pyelonephritis and pyonephrosis*** | Obstruction causes urinary stasis → bacterial overgrowth → ascending infection → pyelonephritis; pus fills a dilated system → pyonephrosis | Pyonephrosis requires urgent drainage — antibiotics alone cannot penetrate a pus-filled obstructed system |
| ***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis*** | Stone obstructs ureter → urine backs up proximal to the obstruction → progressive dilation of ureter (hydroureter) and renal pelvis/calyces (hydronephrosis) | If unrelieved → pressure atrophy of renal cortex → progressive renal parenchymal loss |
| ***Obstructive nephropathy*** | Chronic obstruction → tubular damage → interstitial fibrosis → irreversible loss of renal function | Bilateral obstruction or obstruction in a solitary kidney → **AKI → CKD** if not relieved |
| ***Acute kidney injury (AKI)*** | Complete bilateral obstruction (or unilateral in a solitary kidney) → no urine output → rapid rise in creatinine → uraemia and hyperkalaemia | Post-renal AKI — rapidly reversible if obstruction is relieved promptly; but prolonged obstruction → ATN → irreversible intrinsic renal damage |

#### 2.3 Complications of Glomerulonephritis

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Progressive CKD → ESRD** | Ongoing glomerular inflammation → glomerulosclerosis + tubulointerstitial fibrosis → progressive nephron loss → declining GFR → end-stage requiring dialysis/transplant |
| **Nephrotic syndrome complications** | If proteinuria is heavy ( > 3.5 g/day): hypoalbuminaemia → oedema; loss of antithrombin III → VTE (renal vein thrombosis, PE); loss of immunoglobulins → infection susceptibility; hyperlipidaemia → accelerated atherosclerosis |
| **Nephritic syndrome complications** | Fluid overload → HTN → hypertensive encephalopathy; hyperkalaemia → cardiac arrhythmias; pulmonary oedema |
| **Rapidly progressive GN (RPGN)** | Crescentic GN (anti-GBM, ANCA, severe lupus) → loss of > 50% GFR within weeks to months if untreated → ESRD |

#### 2.4 Complications of BPH (When Hematuria is Part of the Picture)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Acute urinary retention** | Progressive prostatic enlargement → critical obstruction → inability to void → AROU (can be precipitated by alpha-adrenergic stimulation, anticholinergics, alcohol, cold weather) |
| **Chronic retention with overflow incontinence** | Gradual, painless bladder distension → overflow dribbling; patient may be unaware |
| **Recurrent UTI** | Urinary stasis from incomplete emptying → bacterial proliferation → recurrent infections |
| **Bladder stones** | Stasis → supersaturation of urine → stone nucleation within the bladder |
| **Obstructive uropathy** | Severe chronic BOO → bilateral hydronephrosis → CKD |
| ***Post-obstructive diuresis*** | ***After decompression of chronic retention → tubular damage from prolonged obstruction → ↓concentrating ability → rapid fluid and solute loss ( > 200 mL/h × ≥ 2h or > 3 L in 24h)*** [15] → risk of dehydration, hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia if not monitored |

---

### 3. Complications of Investigation and Treatment (Iatrogenic)

***The lecture slide [1] specifically highlights complications of surgical procedures:***

***Complications of surgery include: partial nephrectomy, radical nephrectomy, TURBT, radical cystectomy, radical prostatectomy*** [1].

#### 3.1 Complications of Cystoscopy

| Complication | Mechanism | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **UTI** | Introduction of bacteria via the instrument | ~5%; prophylactic antibiotics reduce risk |
| **Hematuria** (transient) | Mucosal trauma from scope insertion | Common; usually self-limiting |
| **Urethral injury / false passage** | Forceful scope advancement, especially in urethral stricture | Rare with flexible scope; more common with rigid |
| **Bladder perforation** | Excessive force or biopsy through a thin bladder wall | Rare; may require observation or surgical repair |

#### 3.2 Complications of TURBT [5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleeding** | Resection exposes submucosal vessels; deep resection → significant haemorrhage | May require CBI, re-look cystoscopy, or rarely angioembolisation |
| **Bladder perforation** | Deep resection through the bladder wall (especially at dome — thinnest area) | Intraperitoneal perforation requires surgical exploration; extraperitoneal may be managed with catheter drainage |
| **Obturator nerve reflex** | Electrocautery near the lateral wall stimulates the obturator nerve (runs close to the lateral bladder wall) → sudden leg adduction during resection → risk of inadvertent perforation | Prevention: use bipolar energy, general anaesthesia with muscle relaxant, or obturator nerve block |
| **UTI / urosepsis** | Instrument introduction + tumour manipulation → bacteraemia | Antibiotic prophylaxis essential |
| **Urethral stricture** | Repeated instrumentation → urethral scarring → stricture formation | More common with multiple TURBTs |

#### 3.3 Complications of TURP [3]

| Complication | Mechanism | Frequency / Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding (hematuria)*** | ***Secondary to trauma or infection (prostatitis); bleeding requiring blood transfusion ~1%*** [3] | Most common early complication; usually managed with CBI |
| ***TUR syndrome (post-prostatectomy syndrome)*** | ***Hyponatraemia due to systemic absorption of hypotonic glycine irrigating fluid used in monopolar TURP → fluid overload, dilutional hyponatraemia, and glycine toxicity*** [3] | Symptoms: confusion, visual disturbance, N/V, seizures, cardiovascular collapse; risk factors: prolonged resection time ( > 60 min), large prostate, open venous sinuses; ***eliminated by bipolar TURP (uses NS irrigation)*** [3] |
| ***Urethral stricture*** | Urethral trauma from resectoscope → scarring | ~3–5%; presents months later with progressive LUTS |
| ***Urinary incontinence*** | Damage to the external urethral sphincter during resection | ~1%; usually stress incontinence |
| ***Retrograde ejaculation*** | Resection of the bladder neck → incompetent bladder neck during ejaculation → semen passes retrogradely into the bladder | ~65–75%; patients must be counselled pre-operatively; does not affect orgasm but causes infertility |
| ***Erectile dysfunction*** | Thermal injury to the neurovascular bundles (cavernous nerves) running close to the prostate | ~5–10%; less common than after radical prostatectomy |

#### 3.4 Complications of Nephrectomy (Partial and Radical) [1]

| Complication | Partial Nephrectomy | Radical Nephrectomy |
|---|---|---|
| **Bleeding** | Higher risk (exposed parenchymal surface bleeds during and after surgery) | Lower risk (no cut parenchymal surface) |
| **Urine leak** | Collecting system may be entered during resection → post-op urine leak from drain | Not applicable (entire kidney removed) |
| **Renal insufficiency** | Possible if remaining nephron mass insufficient; warm ischaemia time should be < 25 min | ***Immediate loss of one kidney's GFR*** — remaining kidney undergoes compensatory hyperfiltration; greater long-term CKD risk |
| **Injury to adjacent organs** | Spleen (left-sided), liver (right-sided), pancreas, bowel, diaphragm | Same |
| **Venous thromboembolism** | Standard post-surgical risk; IVC involvement in RCC adds risk | Same; IVC tumour thrombectomy carries high risk of massive haemorrhage |
| **Adrenal insufficiency** | Only if ipsilateral adrenalectomy performed | Same |

#### 3.5 Complications of Radical Cystectomy [1]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **High morbidity (30–60% complication rate)** | Major pelvic surgery with extensive dissection + urinary diversion |
| **Urinary diversion complications** | Ileal conduit: stomal stenosis, parastomal hernia, uretero-ileal anastomotic stricture, metabolic acidosis (bowel mucosa reabsorbs Cl⁻ and NH₄⁺); neobladder: continent but requires intermittent self-catheterisation in some; metabolic acidosis |
| **Sexual dysfunction** | Erectile dysfunction (damage to cavernous nerves along prostate/seminal vesicles); in females: vaginal shortening/stenosis |
| **Bowel complications** | Ileus (most common early complication); SBO (adhesions); anastomotic leak |
| **Infection** | Wound infection, pelvic abscess, UTI, urosepsis |
| **VTE** | Extensive pelvic surgery + immobility + cancer hypercoagulability |

#### 3.6 Complications of Radical Prostatectomy [1]

| Complication | Mechanism | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| **Erectile dysfunction** | Damage or resection of neurovascular bundles (NVBs) running posterolateral to the prostate; nerve-sparing technique preserves potency in 40–70% | 30–80% depending on nerve-sparing status, age, baseline function |
| **Urinary incontinence** | Damage to the external urethral sphincter (the main continence mechanism post-prostatectomy, since the internal sphincter/bladder neck is removed) | Stress incontinence in 5–20% at 1 year; improves over 12–18 months |
| **Anastomotic stricture** | Scarring at the vesico-urethral anastomosis | ~5–10%; presents with progressive LUTS |
| **Rectal injury** | Dissection posterior to the prostate close to the anterior rectal wall | Rare ( < 1%); requires repair |
| **Lymphocoele** | Pelvic lymph node dissection → lymph accumulation | May be asymptomatic or cause leg oedema, DVT, infection |

#### 3.7 Complications of Urolithiasis Treatment

| Procedure | Key Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **ESWL** | ***Incomplete fragmentation; urosepsis; perinephric or subcapsular haematoma; steinstrasse ("stone street" — ureteric obstruction by stone fragments)*** [3] | Shock waves cause tissue contusion → haematoma; fragmented stones pile up in the ureter |
| **URS** | Ureteric perforation; ureteric stricture; UTI; stent symptoms (irritative LUTS from indwelling JJ stent) | Scope/laser causes thermal or mechanical injury to ureteral wall |
| **PCNL** | ***Bleeding, sepsis, pneumothorax (supracostal approach), injury to adjacent organs (bowel, spleen), urinoma*** [14] | Tract creation through skin/kidney → traverses vascular parenchyma; supracostal approach risks entering pleural space |

#### 3.8 Complications of Catheterisation [11][15]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **CAUTI (catheter-associated UTI)** | Biofilm formation on catheter surface → ascending bacterial colonisation; risk ↑ by ~5% per day of catheterisation |
| **Urethral trauma and stricture** | Mechanical injury from insertion or long-term indwelling catheter → inflammation → fibrosis → stricture |
| ***Haemorrhage ex-vacuo (transient hematuria)*** | ***Bladder mucosal disruption with sudden emptying of a greatly distended bladder → usually self-limiting, rarely significant*** [15] |
| ***Post-obstructive diuresis*** | ***Tubular damage from prolonged obstruction → ↓concentrating ability → rapid fluid and solute loss; represents physiological response to remove excess fluid but may result in pathological fluid and electrolyte imbalance*** [15] |
| ***Transient hypotension*** | ***Due to vasovagal response or relief of pelvic venous congestion*** [15] |
| **Bladder spasm** | Catheter tip irritates the trigone → detrusor contraction → painful bypassing of urine around the catheter |
| **Encrustation and blockage** | Mineral deposition (calcium, struvite) on catheter surface → lumen occlusion |
| **SCC of bladder** (long-term indwelling) | Chronic irritation → squamous metaplasia → squamous cell carcinoma; risk after > 10 years of indwelling catheter |
| **Complications of suprapubic catheter** | Bowel perforation (if bladder not adequately distended), rectal injury, wound infection [11] |

### 4. Complications Specific to Hematuria Workup Delays

| Complication | Mechanism | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Delayed cancer diagnosis** | Hematuria dismissed as UTI, "benign microscopic hematuria," or attributed to anticoagulants without workup → malignancy progresses from curable (NMIBC, localised RCC) to incurable (muscle-invasive/metastatic) | ***Painless gross hematuria is MALIGNANCY UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE*** [1]; ***anticoagulant use is NOT a satisfactory explanation*** [2] |
| **Missed glomerulonephritis** | Non-glomerular workup performed but glomerular features (dysmorphic RBCs, proteinuria) overlooked → progressive GN undiagnosed → irreversible CKD/ESRD | ***Renal impairment: ↓urine output, S/S of fluid overload (ankle oedema)*** [5][7] |
| **Undiagnosed renal TB** | Sterile pyuria attributed to "contamination" or partial treatment → TB goes undiagnosed → progressive renal destruction → autonephrectomy (non-functioning calcified "putty kidney") | Always send EMU for AFB when sterile pyuria is found [10] |

<Callout title="The Cost of Delay" type="error">
A common exam scenario: a 55-year-old smoker has a single episode of painless gross hematuria. The GP reassures him ("probably nothing, maybe a UTI"). The hematuria resolves spontaneously. Two years later, he re-presents with advanced muscle-invasive bladder cancer. **The lesson: even a single episode of painless gross hematuria in a patient > 35 years with risk factors mandates urgent cystoscopy + upper tract imaging.** The intermittent nature of hematuria from bladder cancer is one of its most dangerous features — patients and doctors are lulled into a false sense of security when the bleeding stops.

### 5. Summary Table — Complications Framework

| Category | Key Complications | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Hematuria itself** | Clot retention (AROU), anaemia, clot colic (ureteric obstruction), haemorrhagic shock (rare), anxiety | Blood in urinary tract → clot formation → mechanical obstruction; chronic blood loss → iron deficiency |
| **Underlying malignancy** | Hydronephrosis, fistula (vesicocolic/vesicovaginal), metastasis, recurrence (field cancerisation) | Tumour growth → obstruction, invasion, haematogenous/lymphatic spread |
| **Underlying stones** | Urosepsis, pyelonephritis/pyonephrosis, hydronephrosis, obstructive nephropathy, AKI | Obstruction → stasis → infection + back-pressure → renal damage |
| **Underlying GN** | CKD → ESRD, nephrotic complications (VTE, infection, hyperlipidaemia), RPGN | Progressive glomerulosclerosis; protein/immunoglobulin losses |
| **Underlying BPH** | AROU, chronic retention, UTI, bladder stones, obstructive uropathy, post-obstructive diuresis | Prostatic enlargement → BOO → stasis → complications |
| **Investigation** | Cystoscopy (UTI, perforation, hematuria); catheterisation (CAUTI, stricture, haemorrhage ex-vacuo) | Instrumentation → mucosal trauma, bacterial introduction |
| **Surgical treatment** | TURBT (perforation, obturator reflex); TURP (TUR syndrome, retrograde ejaculation); nephrectomy (bleeding, CKD); cystectomy (high morbidity); prostatectomy (ED, incontinence) | Specific to each procedure — thermal/mechanical injury, removal of functional tissue |
| **Delayed diagnosis** | Advanced cancer, irreversible CKD from missed GN, destroyed kidney from undiagnosed TB | Failure to investigate promptly → disease progression |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of hematuria itself:**
- **Clot retention** = most important acute complication → AROU → needs 3-way catheter + CBI ± cystoscopic clot evacuation
- **Anaemia** from chronic blood loss → check CBC; iron deficiency suggests ongoing occult bleeding
- **Clot colic** from upper tract bleeding → vermiform clots obstruct ureter → mimics renal colic

**Complications of underlying causes:**
- **Bladder cancer:** hydronephrosis (distal ureteric obstruction), fistulae (vesicocolic → pneumaturia; vesicovaginal → incontinence), metastasis (liver, lung, bone), recurrence (field cancerisation → lifelong cystoscopy surveillance)
- **Urolithiasis:** urosepsis (obstructed + infected = emergency), pyonephrosis, hydronephrosis, obstructive AKI
- **GN:** progressive CKD, nephrotic complications (VTE, infection), RPGN
- **BPH:** AROU, chronic retention, UTI, bladder stones, obstructive uropathy, post-obstructive diuresis

**Iatrogenic complications:**
- **TURP:** TUR syndrome (hyponatraemia from glycine absorption — monopolar only), retrograde ejaculation (65–75%), bleeding
- **TURBT:** bladder perforation, obturator nerve reflex
- **Nephrectomy:** bleeding, CKD (radical > partial)
- **Radical cystectomy:** high morbidity (30–60%), urinary diversion complications, ED
- **Radical prostatectomy:** ED (30–80%), urinary incontinence (5–20%)
- **ESWL:** steinstrasse, perinephric haematoma
- **Catheterisation:** CAUTI, haemorrhage ex-vacuo, post-obstructive diuresis, transient hypotension

**The cost of delay:** Single episode of painless gross hematuria in > 35 y/o + risk factors → MUST investigate urgently. Bladder cancer bleeds intermittently — resolution of hematuria does NOT mean resolution of disease.

Management: 1) Attempt manual irrigation and clot evacuation with a Toomey syringe via the catheter. 2) If fails, replace with a large-bore (22-24 Fr) 3-way catheter. 3) Commence continuous bladder irrigation with normal saline. 4) If still fails: urgent rigid cystoscopy under GA for clot evacuation and cauterisation of the bleeding source."

      question: "What is TUR syndrome? Explain the pathophysiology, the type of TURP it is associated with, and how it can be prevented.",
      markscheme: "TUR syndrome (post-prostatectomy syndrome) = dilutional hyponatraemia + fluid overload due to systemic absorption of hypotonic glycine irrigating fluid through open venous sinuses in the prostatic bed during monopolar TURP. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter so its absorption also causes CNS symptoms (visual disturbance, confusion). It is associated with MONOPOLAR TURP only (because monopolar requires non-conductive irrigant — glycine). Prevention: use BIPOLAR TURP (allows normal saline irrigation — isotonic, no hyponatraemia risk); limit resection time to <60 minutes; experienced surgeon."

    {
      question: "What is post-obstructive diuresis? When does it occur, what is its mechanism, and how should it be monitored and managed?",
      markscheme: "Post-obstructive diuresis = massive urine output (>200 mL/h for >=2h or >3L in 24h) after relief of urinary obstruction (typically chronic retention). Mechanism: prolonged obstruction damages renal tubules, reducing their concentrating ability; accumulated excess fluid and solutes (urea, Na) create an osmotic diuresis once obstruction is relieved. Can be physiological (appropriate clearance of excess fluid) or pathological (ongoing losses causing dehydration and electrolyte imbalance). Monitoring: strict I/O charting, urine output Q2h, daily electrolytes (watch for hypoNa, hypoK). Management: replace approximately half of urine output in the previous hour, preferring oral hydration; IV NS if unable to take oral fluids."
