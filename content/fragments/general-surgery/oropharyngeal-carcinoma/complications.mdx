## Complications of Oropharyngeal Carcinoma

Complications in oropharyngeal carcinoma fall into three major categories: (1) complications of the disease itself (what the tumour does if untreated or progresses), (2) complications of treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), and (3) long-term sequelae affecting quality of life. Understanding these from first principles — what the tumour invades, what the treatment destroys — makes them easy to reason through rather than memorise.

***Head and neck cancer poses special challenges in both resection and reconstruction*** [12]. The oropharynx is at the crossroads of breathing, swallowing, and speaking — any disease or treatment that disrupts this region has profound functional consequences.

***Anatomical disruption will affect morphology and physiology*** [12] — this is the core principle. Every complication below can be traced back to which anatomical structure has been damaged (by tumour or by treatment) and what function that structure normally serves.

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself (Untreated or Progressive Tumour)

#### 1.1 Airway Compromise

- **Mechanism**: Bulky tongue base or pharyngeal wall tumours progressively obstruct the oropharyngeal airway → stridor → respiratory distress → asphyxiation if untreated
- **Why it matters**: ***ALWAYS protect the airway for all H&N cancer*** [2] — airway compromise is the most immediately life-threatening complication
- **Management**: Urgent assessment; may require nasopharyngeal airway, intubation, or emergency tracheostomy

#### 1.2 Haemorrhage

- **Mechanism**: Tumour invades into branches of the external carotid artery (lingual artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, facial artery) or, in advanced cases, into the internal carotid artery itself via parapharyngeal space invasion → friable tumour vasculature → spontaneous haemorrhage or tumour erosion into a major vessel ("carotid blowout")
- **Carotid blowout syndrome**: catastrophic, often fatal haemorrhage from tumour erosion into the carotid artery. Risk factors include prior radiotherapy (weakens the vessel wall), recurrent tumour, wound breakdown, and infection. Presents as sentinel bleed (small warning bleed) → massive haemorrhage

#### 1.3 Aspiration and Aspiration Pneumonia

- **Mechanism**: The oropharynx is critical for the swallowing reflex — the tongue base propels the bolus, the soft palate seals the nasopharynx, and the pharyngeal constrictors generate peristalsis. Tumour infiltration disrupts any of these → loss of airway protection during swallowing → aspiration of food/saliva into the trachea → aspiration pneumonia
- Particularly common with large tongue base tumours (impaired bolus propulsion) and tumours causing CN IX/X palsy (impaired pharyngeal sensation and motor function)

#### 1.4 Malnutrition and Cachexia

- **Mechanism**: Dysphagia and odynophagia → reduced oral intake; tumour-secreted cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) → cancer cachexia (muscle wasting, anorexia, altered metabolism)
- Malnutrition impairs wound healing, immune function, and treatment tolerance

#### 1.5 Lymph Node and Distant Metastasis

- ***Approximately 50% have metastasis at time of presentation*** [2]
- ***Distant metastasis: uncommon but possible sites include brain, lung, liver, bone and skin*** [2]
- Complications of metastasis depend on the organ involved: lung mets → dyspnoea, haemoptysis; bone mets → pathological fractures, pain, hypercalcaemia; liver mets → jaundice, coagulopathy; brain mets → raised ICP, focal neurological deficits

#### 1.6 Synchronous and Metachronous Second Primary Tumours

- ***10% risk of synchronous/metachronous tumour (field cancerisation)*** [4]
- ***Patients who develop tumour in the oral cavity and the oropharynx are more likely to develop a second primary tumour in the upper oesophagus*** [2]
- This is not a "complication" of the tumour per se but a consequence of the same underlying field cancerisation process — the entire mucosal surface is at risk

#### 1.7 Cranial Nerve Palsies

- **Mechanism**: Advanced tumour invades the parapharyngeal space → accesses the carotid sheath → involvement of CN IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), XI (accessory), XII (hypoglossal)
- CN IX palsy → loss of pharyngeal sensation, impaired gag reflex
- CN X palsy → vocal cord paralysis (hoarseness, aspiration risk), cardiac vagal dysfunction
- CN XII palsy → tongue deviation, dysphagia, dysarthria
- CN V3 involvement (medial pterygoid, pterygoid plates) → trismus, facial numbness

### 2. Complications of Treatment

#### 2.1 Complications of Surgery

##### a) Immediate / Intra-operative

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Haemorrhage** | Injury to lingual artery, facial artery, or branches of external carotid during resection; risk increases with re-operation in irradiated fields | Meticulous haemostasis; ligation or cauterisation; interventional radiology for major vessel injury |
| **Airway obstruction** | Post-operative oedema of tongue base/pharynx; haematoma compressing the airway | Prophylactic tracheostomy in major resections; close monitoring; return to theatre for haematoma evacuation |

##### b) Early Post-operative

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Wound infection / breakdown** | Contamination from oral flora (the oropharynx is a "clean-contaminated" field); impaired healing in malnourished or previously irradiated tissue | Antibiotics; wound care; may require return to theatre for debridement |
| **Orocutaneous / pharyngocutaneous fistula** | Breakdown of the pharyngeal repair → saliva leaks through the surgical wound to the skin surface | NPO (nil per os), nutritional support via NG/PEG, wound care; may heal conservatively or require surgical repair |
| **Flap failure** (in reconstructive cases) | Venous thrombosis or arterial insufficiency of the free flap → flap necrosis | Close flap monitoring (colour, capillary refill, Doppler); return to theatre for re-exploration within 6 hours if compromised |
| **Aspiration** | Loss of tongue base bulk after glossectomy or loss of pharyngeal sensation → impaired swallowing mechanics → aspiration | ***Swallowing rehabilitation*** [8]; modified diet; Mendelsohn manoeuvre; in severe cases, temporary tracheostomy with cuffed tube |

##### c) Late Post-operative

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Dysphagia** | ***Voluntary phase usually affected by tumours in the head and neck region; usually immediately after glossectomy or pharyngectomy*** [12]; loss of tongue base contact with palate → impaired bolus propulsion | ***Rehabilitation always — swallowing, voice and hearing*** [8]; speech pathologist; diet modification; prosthetic augmentation to allow tongue-palate contact |
| **Speech impairment** | Resection of soft palate → velopharyngeal insufficiency (nasal regurgitation, hypernasal speech); resection of tongue base → impaired articulation | Speech therapy; palatal prosthesis (obturator) for soft palate defects; prosthetic augmentation |
| **Trismus** (post-surgical) | Fibrosis and scarring in the pterygoid region or temporomandibular joint area after surgery | Physiotherapy; jaw-stretching exercises (Therabite device); prevention better than cure |
| **Neck and shoulder dysfunction** | CN XI (spinal accessory nerve) injury during neck dissection → trapezius denervation → shoulder drop, difficulty abducting arm above horizontal | Physiotherapy; modified radical neck dissection preserves CN XI when oncologically safe |
| **Lymphoedema** (facial/submental) | Disruption of lymphatic channels during neck dissection; particularly bilateral neck dissection | Lymphatic massage; compression garments |

<Callout title="Why Does Glossectomy Cause Dysphagia?">
***The voluntary phase of swallowing is usually affected by tumours in the head and neck region*** [12]. The tongue base is the engine of the oropharyngeal swallow — it pushes the bolus posteriorly against the posterior pharyngeal wall and into the pharynx. After partial or total glossectomy, the tongue base remnant cannot generate sufficient force to propel the bolus → food pools in the valleculae and pyriform sinuses → aspiration risk. Reconstruction using soft tissue free flaps (e.g., radial forearm, ALT flap) provides bulk to restore tongue-palate contact, but motor function cannot be replaced.

#### 2.2 Complications of Radiotherapy

Radiotherapy to the oropharynx and bilateral neck is associated with a wide spectrum of acute and late toxicities. The principle is straightforward: radiation damages all rapidly dividing cells (both tumour and normal tissue) within the radiation field.

##### a) Acute Complications (During and Immediately After RT — First 6 Weeks)

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features and Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Mucositis** | Radiation destroys the rapidly dividing basal cells of the oropharyngeal mucosa → mucosal breakdown, ulceration, pseudomembrane formation | Severe pain → odynophagia → inability to eat → weight loss. Dose-limiting toxicity. Management: analgesics (topical and systemic), magic mouthwash (lidocaine + antacid + diphenhydramine), nutritional support (NG/PEG), meticulous oral hygiene |
| ***Radiation dermatitis*** [13] | Radiation damages skin epithelium → erythema → dry desquamation → moist desquamation | Skincare: gentle washing, moisturisers, avoid trauma to irradiated skin; severe cases need wound care |
| ***Dysphagia and odynophagia*** [13] | Mucositis of the pharynx + oedema of pharyngeal muscles → pain and mechanical obstruction during swallowing | As above for mucositis; proactive swallowing exercises to prevent fibrosis |
| **Taste alteration (dysgeusia)** | Radiation damages taste buds on the tongue → loss of taste | Usually partially recovers over 6–12 months post-RT; zinc supplementation may help |
| **Salivary gland dysfunction (early xerostomia)** | Radiation damages serous acinar cells of the parotid and submandibular glands (serous cells are more radiosensitive than mucinous cells) → reduced salivary flow, thick/ropey saliva | Pilocarpine (muscarinic agonist — stimulates residual salivary tissue); artificial saliva; IMRT spares contralateral parotid to preserve some function |

##### b) Late Complications (Months to Years After RT)

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features and Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Xerostomia (chronic)** | Permanent destruction of salivary acinar cells → irreversible reduction in salivary flow (if > 25–30 Gy to parotid glands) | Lifelong dry mouth → dental caries (saliva normally buffers acid and remineralises enamel), difficulty eating dry food, altered taste, increased oral infections (candidiasis). Management: pilocarpine, artificial saliva, rigorous dental care, fluoride trays |
| **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible** | Radiation → endarteritis obliterans of mandibular blood supply (reduced vascularity) + hypocellularity + hypoxia of bone → impaired healing capacity. Any trauma (tooth extraction, denture pressure) in irradiated bone → non-healing wound → progressive bone necrosis | Exposed, non-healing mandibular bone; pain; pathological fracture; fistula. Prevention: pre-RT dental assessment and extraction of compromised teeth. Treatment: hyperbaric oxygen (controversial), pentoxifylline + vitamin E (PENTOCLO protocol), sequestrectomy, free flap reconstruction for severe cases |
| ***Pharyngeal stenosis (stricture)*** [13] | Radiation-induced fibrosis of pharyngeal muscles and submucosa → progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal lumen | Progressive dysphagia months-years after RT; diagnosed on barium swallow or endoscopy. Treatment: endoscopic dilatation; prevention through proactive swallowing exercises during and after RT |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Radiation to bilateral neck → direct thyroid gland damage + vascular compromise → thyroid failure | Occurs in 20–50% of patients receiving neck irradiation. Screen with TSH every 6–12 months post-RT. Treatment: levothyroxine replacement |
| **Hearing loss (sensorineural)** | If radiation field includes the cochlea (e.g., for tumours extending to parapharyngeal space/skull base) → damage to cochlear hair cells | Audiometry monitoring; hearing aids if needed |
| ***Laryngeal oedema*** [13] | Radiation-induced lymphatic obstruction and inflammation in the larynx → chronic swelling | Hoarseness, stridor in severe cases; steroids for acute flares; tracheostomy if airway compromise |
| **Carotid artery stenosis** | Radiation → accelerated atherosclerosis and intimal fibrosis of the carotid arteries (within the radiation field) → progressive stenosis | Increased long-term risk of stroke/TIA. Screening with carotid Doppler USG recommended 5+ years post-RT |
| **Radiation-induced second malignancy** | Radiation is itself a carcinogen → can induce new primary tumours in the irradiated field after a latency of 5–20+ years | Sarcoma (most common radiation-induced malignancy), second SCC. Rare but important for long-term survivors — especially young HPV-positive patients |
| **Soft tissue fibrosis / trismus** | Fibrosis of masticatory muscles (masseter, pterygoids) → progressive restriction of mouth opening | Jaw-stretching physiotherapy (Therabite); prevention with exercises during RT |
| ***Sometimes delayed presentation of swallowing dysfunction after radiotherapy*** [12] | Progressive fibrosis of pharyngeal constrictors → "late radiation-associated dysphagia" (late-RAD); can present months to years after RT completion even in patients who initially recovered | Proactive swallowing therapy; dilatation; PEG if severe |

<Callout title="Why Does RT Cause ORN Specifically in the Mandible?" type="idea">
The mandible is uniquely vulnerable because: (1) it receives most of its blood supply from the inferior alveolar artery — a single end-artery — so radiation-induced endarteritis causes critical ischaemia with no collateral rescue, (2) the mandible is dense cortical bone with low cellularity and slow turnover, so healing capacity is already limited, and (3) the mandible is directly adjacent to the oropharyngeal mucosal tumour, so it is unavoidably within the high-dose radiation field. The maxilla, by contrast, has a rich dual blood supply and is rarely affected by ORN.

#### 2.3 Complications of Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy (primarily cisplatin) carries systemic toxicities:

| Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Nephrotoxicity** | Cisplatin → direct tubular damage → acute kidney injury; dose-limiting toxicity | Aggressive IV hydration pre/post cisplatin; monitor creatinine and eGFR; switch to carboplatin if renal impairment |
| **Ototoxicity** | Cisplatin → damage to outer hair cells of the cochlea → high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss (irreversible) | Pre-treatment and serial audiometry; dose adjustment if significant hearing loss |
| **Nausea and vomiting** | Cisplatin is highly emetogenic → stimulates CTZ (chemoreceptor trigger zone) and peripheral 5-HT3 receptors in the gut | Prophylactic anti-emetics: 5-HT3 antagonist (ondansetron) + NK1 antagonist (aprepitant) + dexamethasone |
| **Myelosuppression** | All cytotoxic agents → bone marrow suppression → neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia | Monitor FBC; neutropenic sepsis protocol if febrile + neutropenic (urgent IV broad-spectrum antibiotics); G-CSF if recurrent |
| **Mucositis** (additive with RT) | Chemotherapy + RT = synergistic mucosal toxicity | As per RT mucositis management above; often dose-limiting in concurrent CRT |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Cisplatin → damage to dorsal root ganglia → sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling in hands/feet) | Dose-dependent; partially reversible; no specific treatment |

---

#### 2.4 Complications of Immunotherapy

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) are used in recurrent/metastatic disease and have a unique side-effect profile:

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Examples |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Immune-related adverse events (irAEs)** | Checkpoint inhibitors remove the "brakes" on the immune system → T cells attack normal tissues (autoimmune phenomenon) | Pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, thyroiditis (hypo/hyperthyroidism), dermatitis, myocarditis, adrenalitis, hypophysitis |
| **Management principle** | Hold immunotherapy; corticosteroids for moderate-severe irAEs; specialist input for organ-specific toxicity | Grade 1–2: monitor ± steroids; Grade 3–4: high-dose steroids, discontinue drug, consider additional immunosuppression (infliximab for colitis, mycophenolate for hepatitis) |

---

### 3. Psychosocial and Quality-of-Life Complications

These are often underappreciated but profoundly impact patients:

| Domain | Mechanism | Approach |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Depression and anxiety** | Disfigurement, dysphagia, dysphonia, social isolation, fear of recurrence | Psychological/psychiatric support; antidepressants; support groups |
| **Social isolation** | Inability to eat normally (tube feeding), speech changes, facial disfigurement → patients avoid social situations | MDT approach; speech therapy; social worker involvement |
| **Body image disturbance** | ***Most frequently exposed region of the body*** [12] — head and neck are visible; surgical scars, tracheostomy, PEG visible to others | Counselling; reconstructive surgery to optimise cosmesis; prosthetic rehabilitation |
| **Financial hardship** | Prolonged treatment course (7 weeks CRT), inability to work during treatment, ongoing rehabilitation | Social worker support; disability assessment |

***Head and neck cancer poses special challenges in both resection and reconstruction*** [12] — ***individualise the option of surgery to achieve the best functional and cosmetic result*** [12].

### 4. Summary — Complications Organised by Timing

| Timing | Disease Complications | Treatment Complications |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **At presentation** | Airway compromise, aspiration, malnutrition, cranial nerve palsies, nodal/distant metastasis | — |
| **During treatment** | — | Mucositis, radiation dermatitis, dysphagia, nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression, nephrotoxicity |
