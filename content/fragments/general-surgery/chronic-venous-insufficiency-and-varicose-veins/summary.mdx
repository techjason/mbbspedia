### Etiology & Pathophysiology

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is the definition of varicose veins? What three criteria are required?">
**Dilated, tortuous subcutaneous veins ≥ 3 mm in diameter**, measured in the **upright position**, with **demonstrable reflux** (valve closure time > 0.5 s on duplex USG). All three elements are needed — without reflux, it's just a dilated vein.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the difference between CVD and CVI?">
- **CVD (chronic venous disease)** = the entire spectrum (CEAP C0–C6), including asymptomatic spider veins
- **CVI (chronic venous insufficiency)** = only the clinically significant end — **CEAP C3–C6** (oedema, skin changes, or ulceration)

Every patient with CVI has CVD, but not every patient with CVD has CVI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe the course of the GSV and SSV, their termination points, and the nerve at risk for each.">
| | GSV | SSV |
|---|---|---|
| **Origin** | Medial side of dorsal venous arch | Lateral side of dorsal venous arch |
| **Course** | Anterior to medial malleolus → posterior to medial patella → medial thigh | Posterior to lateral malleolus → midline of posterior calf |
| **Termination** | **Saphenofemoral junction (SFJ)** → common femoral vein | **Saphenopopliteal junction (SPJ)** → popliteal vein |
| **SFJ location** | **2.5 cm lateral and inferior to the pubic tubercle** | — |
| **Nerve at risk** | **Saphenous nerve** (medial calf/foot numbness) | **Sural nerve** (posterolateral leg/lateral foot numbness) |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the most important mechanism of venous return from the lower limbs?">
The **calf muscle pump ("peripheral heart")**. Contraction of gastrocnemius/soleus compresses venous sinuses → propels blood into popliteal veins towards the heart. During relaxation, deep venous pressure drops → blood flows from superficial to deep via perforators. One-way bicuspid valves prevent backflow. The respiratory pump (negative intrathoracic pressure during inspiration) is the second mechanism.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the core pathophysiology of CVI? Describe the cascade.">
**Venous hypertension** is the central concept.

Valve incompetence / obstruction / pump failure → venous reflux/stasis → **sustained venous hypertension** → capillary distension → increased permeability → leakage of fluid, proteins, and RBCs → **oedema** (C3) + **haemosiderin deposition** (C4a) + pericapillary **fibrin cuffs** → impaired O₂ diffusion → tissue hypoxia → **WBC trapping and activation** → proteases, ROS, cytokines → **lipodermatosclerosis** (C4b) → **venous ulceration** (C5/C6).

Three hypotheses: white cell trapping (Coleridge-Smith), fibrin cuff (Browse & Burnand), growth factor trapping (Falanga & Eaglstein).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the most important secondary cause of CVI? Name one congenital cause with its classic triad.">
**DVT → post-thrombotic syndrome** is the most important secondary cause. Thrombus damages valve leaflets → permanent reflux.

**Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome** (congenital): triad of (1) varicose veins on **lateral thigh** (atypical distribution), (2) **port wine stains**, (3) bony and soft tissue **hypertrophy** of the affected limb.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is May-Thurner syndrome and when should you suspect it?">
**Left common iliac vein** compressed between the **right common iliac artery** and the **lumbar vertebral body**. Suspect in a **young woman** with isolated **left leg** varicose veins or left iliofemoral DVT. It predisposes to left-sided DVT and CVI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="List the full CEAP classification with all components.">
| Component | Meaning | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **C** (Clinical) | C0: No signs, C1: Telangiectasia/reticular veins, **C2: Varicose veins (≥3mm)**, **C3: Oedema**, **C4a: Pigmentation/eczema**, **C4b: LDS/atrophie blanche**, **C5: Healed ulcer**, **C6: Active ulcer** | Each subscripted S (symptomatic) or A (asymptomatic) |
| **E** (Etiological) | Ec (congenital), **Ep (primary — most common)**, Es (secondary), En (none) | |
| **A** (Anatomical) | **As** (superficial), **Ap** (perforator), **Ad** (deep), An (none) | Requires duplex USG |
| **P** (Pathophysiological) | **Pr** (reflux), **Po** (obstruction), Pr,o (both), Pn (none) | Requires duplex USG |

**Example**: Symptomatic varicose veins from primary GSV reflux = **C2S, Ep, As, Pr**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do venous ulcers occur at the medial gaiter area?">
This is the site of the **Cockett perforators** (medial calf perforators), which connect the posterior tibial vein to GSV tributaries. When perforator valves fail, high-pressure deep venous blood is transmitted directly to the superficial subcutaneous tissues here. The skin at this location is thin and poorly vascularised, making it particularly vulnerable.
</Accordion>

### Differential Diagnosis

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="How do you differentiate venous from arterial ulcers? (6 features)">
| Feature | Venous Ulcer | Arterial Ulcer |
|---|---|---|
| **Location** | Medial gaiter area | Toes, between digits, lateral malleolus, heel |
| **Depth** | Shallow | Deep |
| **Edge** | Gently sloping | Punched-out |
| **Pain** | Usually painless (unless infected) | Very painful |
| **Surrounding skin** | Haemosiderin-stained, eczematous, fibrotic | Cold, thin, shiny, hairless |
| **Pulses** | Present | Absent or weak |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do you differentiate lymphoedema from venous oedema?">
| Feature | Lymphoedema | Venous oedema (CVI) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stemmer sign** | **Positive** (cannot lift skin fold of 2nd toe) | Negative |
| **Pitting** | Non-pitting in late stages | Pitting |
| **Distribution** | Affects **dorsum of foot** | Affects **gaiter area** |
| **Skin** | Warty, thickened | Haemosiderin pigmentation, eczema |
| **Improvement** | Does NOT improve overnight | Better with elevation |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is acute lipodermatosclerosis commonly misdiagnosed as, and how do you tell them apart?">
Acute LDS is commonly misdiagnosed as **cellulitis** or **acute superficial thrombophlebitis**.

Key differentiators:
- Acute LDS occurs in the context of **known CVI** at the gaiter area
- Does **NOT respond to antibiotics**
- No entry wound
- Other CVI skin changes are present (pigmentation, varicosities)
- Cellulitis has an entry point, systemic features (fever, raised WCC/CRP), and responds to antibiotics
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do you differentiate a saphena varix from a femoral hernia?">
| Feature | Saphena Varix | Femoral Hernia |
|---|---|---|
| **Location** | At SFJ (2.5 cm inferolateral to pubic tubercle) | Below and lateral to pubic tubercle |
| **Colour** | Bluish tinge | Skin-coloured |
| **Compressibility** | Easily compressible, empties on pressure | May be irreducible |
| **Cough impulse** | Present | Present |
| **Lying down** | Disappears | May persist |
| **Venous hum** | May be present | Absent |

Both have a cough impulse — but the saphena varix is easily compressible with a blue tinge and disappears on lying down.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is Marjolin's ulcer? When to suspect it and how to investigate?">
**Malignant transformation** (usually **SCC**, rarely BCC) in a chronic venous ulcer/scar. Occurs in **~2%** of long-standing venous ulcers.

**Suspect when**: A chronic ulcer changes character — becomes **raised**, develops **everted edges**, **bleeds easily**, grows rapidly, or fails to heal despite adequate therapy.

**Investigation**: **4-quadrant biopsy** of the ulcer edge + **palpate groin lymph nodes** for metastasis.
</Accordion>

</Accordions>

### Diagnosis & Investigations

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What is the gold standard investigation for CVI/varicose veins and what key questions does it answer?">
**Venous duplex ultrasound** (B-mode + Doppler).

Key questions answered:
1. **Is there reflux?** (valve closure time > 0.5 s = abnormal; > 0.35 s for perforators)
2. **Where is the reflux?** (SFJ, SPJ, GSV/SSV trunks, perforators)
3. **Is there DVT?** (non-compressible vein = DVT — contraindication to surgery)
4. **Is the deep system competent?** (combined deep + superficial incompetence = conservative only)
5. **Vein diameter and tortuosity** (determines suitability for endovenous treatment)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the ABPI threshold for compression therapy and why is it critical?">
- **ABPI > 0.9**: Normal — safe for full compression
- **ABPI 0.5–0.9**: Mixed disease — reduced compression with caution
- **ABPI < 0.4**: **Absolute contraindication to compression**

Compression on an ischaemic limb further reduces arterial perfusion pressure → **tissue necrosis**. In diabetics, ABPI may be falsely elevated (calcified arteries) → use **toe pressures** instead.

**ABPI must be checked before prescribing any compression therapy — this is non-negotiable.**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Describe the Trendelenburg (tourniquet) test and interpret the possible results.">
1. Patient supine → elevate leg to empty veins
2. Apply tourniquet below SFJ
3. Patient stands → observe filling

| Result | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| Veins **stay empty** while standing; **rapid fill on release** | **SFJ incompetence only** (tourniquet controlled it) |
| Veins **fill rapidly** despite tourniquet | **Incompetence below tourniquet level** (perforators) |
| Partial filling while standing + more on release | **Both SFJ and perforator incompetence** |

Repeat at progressively lower levels to localise perforator incompetence.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What does a positive Perthes' test mean and why is it important?">
**Perthes' test** assesses **deep venous patency**.

Procedure: Apply tourniquet at SFJ → patient walks (activates calf pump).
- **Negative** (veins decrease): Deep system patent ✓
- **Positive** (pain and swelling): Deep system **occluded** — superficial veins are the **only route** for venous return

**Significance**: If the deep system is occluded, **do NOT ablate or strip** the superficial veins — you'd remove the patient's only outflow pathway.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the 'Mickey Mouse sign' on duplex USG?">
On transverse B-mode at the groin, three circular structures form a "Mickey Mouse" appearance:
- **Common femoral artery (CFA)** — larger circle, pulsatile
- **Common femoral vein (CFV)** — compressible circle
- **GSV at the SFJ** — smaller circle joining the CFV

This is the classic teaching image for locating the saphenofemoral junction.
</Accordion>

### Management

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What are the contraindications to varicose vein surgery?">
1. **Pregnancy** — risk of DVT; veins often improve post-partum
2. **Acute DVT** — risk of embolisation; superficial veins may serve as collateral
3. **Combined deep AND superficial venous incompetence** — blood has **no alternative route back**; ablating superficial system = catastrophic
4. **Severe PAD** — compression post-procedure would compromise arterial perfusion
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compare EVLA vs RFA — state one advantage of each.">
| | EVLA | RFA |
|---|---|---|
| **Advantage** | **Higher success rate**, less expensive | **Faster recovery**, less post-operative pain |
| **Anaesthesia** | Tumescent (both) | Tumescent (both) |
| **First-line?** | Preferred modality overall | Alternative to EVLA |

Both are endovenous thermal ablation techniques requiring tumescent anaesthesia.

**Mnemonic**: **E**VLA = **E**xtra Victory (higher success). **R**FA = **R**apid Fast recovery.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is VenaSeal and what are its key advantages over thermal ablation?">
**Cyanoacrylate (glue) adhesive** injected sequentially via catheter to seal varicose veins.

Key advantages:
1. **Non-thermal** — no risk of skin burns
2. **No tumescent anaesthesia** — fewer needles, less discomfort
3. **No compression stockings required post-operatively** — major patient comfort benefit

Requires compression along the vein from proximal to distal after injection.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the Trendelenburg operation and why must GSV stripping be limited to the thigh?">
**Trendelenburg operation** = **SFJ flush ligation** — oblique groin incision, ligate GSV flush with the femoral vein, ligate all tributaries individually. "Flush" is critical because a remaining stump → saphena varix.

**GSV stripping limited to thigh only** because:
- The **saphenous nerve** runs in close proximity to the GSV in the **distal calf**
- Below-knee stripping does NOT improve symptomatic relief
- But **significantly increases saphenous nerve injury** → numbness along medial calf and foot
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How are venous ulcers managed? What if an ulcer doesn't heal?">
1. **Leg elevation + mobilisation** (calf pump)
2. **Wound care**: debridement, appropriate dressings
3. **4-layer graduated compression bandage** (ABPI must be > 0.4)
4. Antibiotics only if **clinical infection** (not colonisation)
5. Treat underlying varicose veins

**50–70% of venous ulcers heal within 3 months** with compression.

**If non-healing**: **4-quadrant biopsy** to exclude **Marjolin's ulcer** (SCC, 2%) + palpate groin LN. Consider **fenestrated split-thickness skin graft**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What must you counsel patients about before varicose vein surgery?">
Three critical counselling points:
1. **Surgery will NOT reverse existing skin changes** — pigmentation, LDS, and atrophie blanche are permanent. Treatment only prevents progression
2. **May not improve all symptoms** — pain may have other causes
3. **Recurrence rate is ~30%** — this is a chronic condition

Post-op: early ambulation, compression stockings × 4 weeks, follow-up duplex at 2–3 days, no driving × 1 week.
</Accordion>

### Complications

<Accordions type="single">

<Accordion title="What are the two nerves at risk during varicose vein surgery? Describe each deficit.">
| Nerve | At Risk During | Sensory Deficit |
|---|---|---|
| **Saphenous nerve** | GSV stripping, **especially below the knee** | Pain/numbness along **medial calf and medial foot** |
| **Sural nerve** | SSV stripping | Pain/numbness in **posterolateral leg and lateral foot** |

Both are purely sensory — motor function is preserved. This is why GSV stripping is limited to above-knee only.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the four causes of varicose vein recurrence (~30%) and which territory has higher recurrence?">
1. **Neovascularisation** — new small veins grow across the ligated junction, re-establishing reflux
2. **Reflux in residual axial vein** — incomplete treatment of the trunk
3. **New junctional reflux** — previously competent junction develops reflux
4. **Inadequate initial surgery** — missed perforators or untreated tributaries

**SSV territory** has higher recurrence than GSV.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do you manage bleeding from a varicose vein?">
**Elevation + direct pressure.** Lay the patient down, elevate the leg above heart level, apply firm pressure with a pad.

**Do NOT apply a tourniquet** — it worsens venous congestion and increases bleeding.

This is low-pressure venous bleeding and is almost always controlled with this simple manoeuvre. Refer for definitive treatment of the varicose vein afterwards.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does ankle contracture create a vicious cycle in advanced CVI?">
Chronic **lipodermatosclerosis** → subcutaneous fibrosis around ankle → **fixed flexion contracture** → restricts ankle range of motion → **impairs calf muscle pump** (requires full dorsiflexion) → worsening venous stasis and hypertension → accelerates further fibrosis and skin damage → more contracture.

This self-perpetuating cycle is why early treatment of LDS and physiotherapy are important.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are the complications of compression therapy?">
| Complication | Prevention |
|---|---|
| **Pressure necrosis** | Proper fitting, padding over bony prominences |
| **Contact dermatitis** | Hypoallergenic stockings |
| **Fungal infection** | Good foot hygiene |
| **Tourniquet effect** | Proper length, patient education |
| **Tissue ischaemia** | **Always check ABPI — CI if < 0.4** |
