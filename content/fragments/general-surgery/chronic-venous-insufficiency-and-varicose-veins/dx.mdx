## Diagnostic Criteria, Algorithm, and Investigations

### 1. Diagnostic Criteria — What Makes the Diagnosis?

Unlike conditions such as rheumatic fever or SLE, CVI and varicose veins do not have strict "diagnostic criteria" in the traditional sense (no scoring system with X out of Y needed). Instead, the diagnosis is made through a **combination of clinical assessment and confirmatory imaging**, structured by the CEAP classification.

Let me lay out the diagnostic requirements for each key entity:

#### 1.1 Varicose Veins

The diagnosis requires ALL of [1][2]:
1. **Clinical**: Visible dilated, tortuous subcutaneous veins ≥ 3 mm in diameter, measured in the **upright position**
2. **Functional**: ***Demonstrable reflux*** — this is confirmed by duplex ultrasound showing retrograde flow with ***valve closure time > 0.5 seconds*** [1][2]

Without demonstrable reflux on duplex, a dilated vein is just that — a dilated vein. It is the reflux that makes it a "varicose vein" by definition.

#### 1.2 Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI)

CVI is defined as chronic venous disease of **CEAP class C3–C6** [1][2]:
- Requires the presence of **oedema (C3), skin changes (C4), or ulceration (C5/C6)**
- Plus evidence of **venous aetiology** (reflux, obstruction, or both) — confirmed by duplex USG

#### 1.3 CEAP Classification as the Diagnostic Framework

The CEAP classification itself serves as the diagnostic framework — once you have completed your clinical assessment and investigations, you assign the full CEAP descriptor. This is the international standard for documenting and communicating the diagnosis [1][2][3]:

| Component | What You're Classifying | How You Determine It |
|---|---|---|
| **C** (Clinical) | What you see and what the patient reports (C0–C6, S or A) | Clinical inspection and history |
| **E** (Etiological) | Why it happened (Ec, Ep, Es, En) | History (congenital? post-DVT? idiopathic?) |
| **A** (Anatomical) | Which venous system is affected (As, Ap, Ad, An) | ***Duplex USG*** |
| **P** (Pathophysiological) | What went wrong (Pr, Po, Pr,o, Pn) | ***Duplex USG*** |

The key insight: **C is clinical; E, A, and P require investigations (primarily duplex USG) to complete.**

<Callout title="You Cannot Complete CEAP Without Duplex USG">
Clinical inspection alone gives you the C class. But to assign the A (anatomical) and P (pathophysiological) components — i.e., to know whether it's reflux vs. obstruction, and whether the superficial, deep, or perforator system is involved — you need duplex ultrasound. This is why duplex is the cornerstone investigation.

### 2. Diagnostic Algorithm

### 3. History Taking — What Matters and Why

The history in CVI/varicose veins is not just a formality — it determines etiology (E component of CEAP), guides investigation, and identifies contraindications to treatment [1][2]:

| History Component | Specific Questions | Clinical Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **Presenting complaint** | Onset, duration, progression. Cosmetic concern vs. symptomatic (pain, heaviness, swelling, itching) | Determines whether treatment is needed and urgency. Acute onset of unilateral swelling → think DVT, not chronic CVI |
| **Symptom pattern** | Worse at end of day? Relieved by elevation? Worse with standing? | ***Venous symptoms worsen throughout the day and with standing, and are relieved by elevation and walking*** [1]. If pain is worse with walking and relieved by rest → think arterial |
| **PMHx — DVT** | ***Previous DVT or superficial thrombophlebitis*** [1] | Post-thrombotic syndrome is the most common secondary cause. Also, ***DVT must be excluded as it is a contraindication to varicose vein surgery*** [1] |
| **PMHx — Pregnancy** | Number of pregnancies, current pregnancy | Increased abdominal pressure + hormonal changes. ***Pregnancy is a contraindication to surgery*** [1] |
| **PMHx — Comorbidities** | Heart failure, liver disease, renal disease, thyroid disease, diabetes | Exclude other causes of oedema. Diabetes → check for neuropathic component of ulcers |
| **Drug history** | OCP, HRT, CCBs, NSAIDs, anticoagulants | OCP/HRT increase DVT risk. CCBs cause dependent oedema (mimic). Anticoagulants relevant for surgical planning |
| **FHx** | ***Family history of varicose veins*** [1] | Strong genetic component in primary varicose veins |
| **SHx** | ***Occupation requiring prolonged standing*** [1], exercise habits, smoking | Occupational risk; exercise promotes calf pump; smoking → assess atherosclerotic risk if mixed disease |

---

### 4. Physical Examination — A Systematic Approach

The examination should be performed with the patient **standing** (veins fill in the dependent position) with the legs fully exposed [1][2]:

#### 4.1 Inspection

- ***Surgical scars*** — previous venous surgery (recurrence is common — 30%) [2]
- ***Location of varicosities*** — the single most important inspection finding for localising incompetence [1]:

| Distribution | Implies Incompetence Of |
|---|---|
| ***Medial thigh and medial calf*** | ***Great saphenous vein (GSV)*** |
| ***Posterior calf*** | ***Small saphenous vein (SSV)*** |
| ***Anterolateral thigh and anterolateral calf*** | ***Isolated incompetence of proximal anterolateral GSV tributary*** |
| Lateral thigh (atypical) | Consider Klippel-Trénaunay or lateral accessory saphenous reflux |

- ***Signs of CVI*** — systematically assess for all C-class features [1][2]:
  - Corona phlebectatica (malleolar flare)
  - Hyperpigmentation (gaiter area)
  - Venous eczema
  - Lipodermatosclerosis (***hyperpigmentation + erythema + induration + tenderness — palpate!***) [2]
  - Atrophie blanche
  - Healed or active ulceration (medial gaiter area)

#### 4.2 Palpation

- ***Palpate along course of GSV and SSV*** and their tributaries for varicosities and tenderness [1][2]
- ***Check peripheral pulses*** — ***rule out PAD since management includes compression*** [1][2]. This is not optional — it is a safety-critical step
- ***Pitting oedema*** — confined to ankle area usually, may extend proximally [1]
- ***Saphena varix*** — at the inguinal region: a ***compressible lump with cough impulse that refills on release*** [1][2]
- ***Inguinal lymph nodes*** — if venous ulcers present, check for lymphadenopathy (infection or Marjolin transformation) [2]
- ***Neurological function*** — test sensation (e.g., sural nerve territory) if surgical scars present, to document pre-existing nerve damage [2]

#### 4.3 Tourniquet Test (Trendelenburg Test)

This classic bedside test localises the level of valvular incompetence. Although largely superseded by duplex USG, it remains an exam favourite [1][2]:

**Procedure** [1]:
1. Patient lies supine → **elevate leg** to empty superficial veins (or stroke blood proximally)
2. Apply tourniquet tightly around the **upper thigh** (just below SFJ)
3. Patient **stands up quickly** → observe filling of varicose veins

**Interpretation** [1]:

| Finding | Interpretation | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| ***NO refilling below tourniquet*** while standing; rapid filling on release | ***SFJ incompetence only*** | The tourniquet blocked reflux from the SFJ, keeping the veins empty. When released, blood refluxes down from the femoral vein through the incompetent SFJ |
| ***Rapid refilling below tourniquet*** while standing | ***Incompetence at sites BELOW the tourniquet*** (perforators or other levels) | Blood is entering the superficial system below the tourniquet level — through incompetent perforators or lower reflux points |
| Partial filling while standing; further filling on release | ***SFJ incompetence AND perforator/other incompetence below*** | Both levels contributing |

- ***The test is repeated with the tourniquet at progressively lower levels***: mid-thigh, above knee, below knee [1][2]
- ***Below-knee tourniquet specifically excludes SSV incompetence*** [1]

#### 4.4 Modified Perthes' Test

This tests **deep venous patency** [2]:
1. Apply tourniquet around the SFJ (blocking superficial reflux)
2. Ask the patient to **walk** (activating the calf muscle pump)
3. If the deep system is **patent**: walking should empty the leg via the deep veins → varicosities decrease
4. If the deep system is **NOT patent**: walking causes ***swelling and pain*** — blood cannot drain through the deep system and the tourniquet blocks superficial drainage → the leg is trapped

<Callout title="Why Perthes' Test Matters" type="idea">
If the deep venous system is occluded (e.g., old DVT), the superficial varicose veins may be the patient's ONLY route for venous return. Stripping or ablating these veins would be catastrophic — you'd remove their only outflow pathway. This is why assessing deep venous patency is essential before surgery, and Perthes' test is the clinical correlate of what duplex USG confirms definitively.
</Callout>

#### 4.5 Completing the Examination

- ***Auscultate over varicosities*** for a continuous bruit — suggests AV malformation [1]
- ***Examine inguinal region*** for mass or lymphadenopathy causing venous outflow obstruction [1]
- ***Abdominal and PR examination*** — if secondary causes suspected (pelvic mass obstructing IVC/iliac veins) [2]
- ***ABPI measurement*** — to rule out PAD before compression therapy [2]

---

### 5. Investigation Modalities

#### 5.1 Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)

**What it is**: Ratio of the highest systolic BP at the ankle (dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial) to the highest brachial systolic BP, measured using a handheld Doppler and sphygmomanometer [1][5].

**Why you need it**: ***Compression therapy (stockings, bandaging) is the mainstay of CVI management. Applying compression to an ischaemic limb can cause tissue necrosis.*** ABPI is therefore a **mandatory safety check** before any compression or surgical planning [2].

| ABPI Value | Interpretation | Clinical Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **> 1.3** | ***Calcified (incompressible) arteries*** — e.g., diabetes, CKD | ABPI unreliable. Need alternative arterial assessment (toe pressures, duplex) |
| **0.9–1.3** | ***Normal*** | Safe for full compression therapy |
| **0.5–0.9** | ***Moderate PAD (claudication range)*** | Mixed arterio-venous disease. Use reduced compression with caution. Needs arterial assessment |
| **< 0.5** | ***Severe PAD (critical limb ischaemia range)*** | Compression is dangerous |
| ***< 0.4*** | ***Absolute contraindication to compression*** [2] | Do NOT apply compression stockings or bandaging |

<Callout title="ABPI Before Compression — Non-Negotiable" type="error">
Every student and junior doctor must check ABPI before prescribing compression. An ABPI below 0.4 is an absolute contraindication. In diabetics, ABPI may be falsely elevated due to calcified arteries — use toe pressures instead.
</Callout>

#### 5.2 Venous Duplex Ultrasound — The Gold Standard Investigation

This is the **cornerstone investigation** for CVI and varicose veins. "Duplex" means it combines two modalities [1][2]:

- ***B-mode USG*** (real-time 2D greyscale imaging) — shows anatomy (vein diameter, course, thrombus)
- ***Doppler*** (colour flow and spectral waveform) — shows haemodynamics (flow direction, velocity, reflux)

##### Why Duplex is the Gold Standard

It answers every question you need answered before making treatment decisions:

| Question | How Duplex Answers It |
|---|---|
| **Is there reflux?** | ***Reflux = retrograde flow in the reverse direction to physiological flow. Valve closure time > 0.5 seconds is defined as abnormal*** [1]. Elicited by calf compression-release (manual squeeze or cuff deflation) or Valsalva |
| **Where is the reflux?** | Maps reflux at SFJ, SPJ, along GSV/SSV trunks, perforators — completing the A component of CEAP |
| **Which junctions are incompetent?** | ***SFJ and/or SPJ incompetence*** determines the surgical approach [1] |
| **What is the vein diameter?** | Determines suitability for endovenous treatment (most devices work best in 5–12 mm diameter range) |
| **Is the vein tortuous?** | ***Tortuosity*** affects whether an endovenous catheter can be passed. Very tortuous veins may need surgical stripping instead [2] |
| **Is there a saphena varix?** | Visible on B-mode as a dilated segment at the SFJ |
| **Is there DVT?** | ***DVT must be excluded since it is a contraindication to varicose vein surgery*** [1]. B-mode shows non-compressible vein (normally a vein should be fully compressible with probe pressure). Intraluminal thrombus may be visible |
| **Is the deep system competent?** | ***Competence of the deep venous system must be assessed*** — if both deep and superficial systems are incompetent, surgery on the superficial system alone is contraindicated (blood has no alternative route) [1][2] |
| **Is there perforator incompetence?** | Incompetent perforators appear as bidirectional flow with reflux > 0.35 seconds |

##### The "Mickey Mouse" Sign [2]

On transverse B-mode at the groin, three circular structures are visible side by side:
- **Common femoral artery (CFA)** — larger circle, pulsatile
- **Common femoral vein (CFV)** — compressible circle
- **Great saphenous vein (GSV)** at the SFJ — smaller circle joining the CFV

This looks like Mickey Mouse's head and ears — a classic teaching image for locating the SFJ.

##### Indications for Duplex USG [1]

- **All patients being considered for intervention** (endovenous or surgical)
- ***Recurrent varicose veins*** [1]
- ***Complications of CVI***: hyperpigmentation, venous stasis eczema, venous ulcers [1]
- ***History of superficial thrombophlebitis or DVT*** [1]
- Atypical presentation or suspected secondary cause
- Pre-operative mapping and planning

##### How Reflux is Elicited During the Study

The patient is examined in the **standing or reverse Trendelenburg position** (to maximise venous pooling). The sonographer:
1. Places the probe over the vein segment being tested
2. ***Squeezes the calf*** (or uses a pneumatic cuff) to push blood proximally
3. Releases → observes for retrograde flow on the Doppler waveform
4. ***If reflux lasts > 0.5 seconds → incompetent valve*** [1]

For perforators, the threshold is slightly different: ***> 0.35 seconds is considered abnormal***.

#### 5.3 Continuous Wave Doppler (Handheld Doppler)

- ***Pen-like handheld probe*** that detects blood flow direction using the Doppler principle [1]
- ***Helpful for screening reflux at SFJ and SPJ*** in the office setting [1]
- **Limitations**: ***Unable to quantitate reflux or provide precise anatomical information*** [1] — it tells you "there is reflux here" but not exactly which vein, how much, or whether the deep system is involved
- In modern practice, this has been largely replaced by duplex USG for definitive assessment, but remains useful as a quick bedside screening tool

#### 5.4 Ultrasound Abdomen / Pelvis

- **Indication**: When a ***secondary cause is suspected*** [2] — e.g., pelvic mass (ovarian cyst, fibroid, pelvic malignancy), IVC obstruction, May-Thurner syndrome
- Look for: Pelvic masses compressing the iliac veins, lymphadenopathy, ascites
- Consider in:
  - Young patients with unexplained unilateral CVI
  - Patients with no typical risk factors
  - New-onset varicose veins with abdominal symptoms

#### 5.5 CT Venography / MR Venography

- **Not routine** — reserved for complex or recurrent cases
- **Indications**:
  - Suspected iliocaval obstruction (May-Thurner syndrome, IVC thrombosis)
  - Pelvic venous congestion syndrome
  - Planning for deep venous reconstruction or stenting
  - Congenital venous anomalies (Klippel-Trénaunay)
- **CT venography**: Good spatial resolution, involves contrast and radiation
- **MR venography**: No radiation, excellent soft tissue contrast, but longer acquisition time and limited availability
- **Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)**: Increasingly used during endovascular procedures to assess iliac vein stenosis (May-Thurner) — gives cross-sectional area and degree of compression from within the vessel

#### 5.6 Laboratory Investigations

Laboratory tests are not used to diagnose CVI itself but are important in the **work-up of complications and differential diagnoses**:

| Investigation | Indication | What You're Looking For |
|---|---|---|
| **CBC with differential** | Venous ulcer with suspected infection | Leucocytosis (infection). Also baseline before surgery |
| **CRP / ESR** | Suspected infection, vasculitis | Elevated in infection and inflammation |
| **Wound swab for C/ST** | Infected venous ulcer | Identify causative organism (commonly *S. aureus*) and guide antibiotic therapy |
| **Serum albumin** | Exclude hypoalbuminaemia as cause of oedema | Low albumin → nephrotic, liver disease, malnutrition |
| **Renal / liver function** | Exclude non-venous causes of oedema | Renal failure → fluid overload; liver failure → hypoalbuminaemia + portal hypertension |
| **Thyroid function** | Pretibial myxoedema mimicking CVI skin changes | Hyperthyroidism (Graves) |
| **Coagulation screen + thrombophilia screen** | Young patient with DVT-related CVI, recurrent VTE | Factor V Leiden, protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, antiphospholipid antibodies |
| **HbA1c / fasting glucose** | Diabetic patient with ulcer | Assess glycaemic control; diabetic ulcers have different pathogenesis and management |
| ***4-quadrant biopsy*** | ***Non-healing venous ulcer*** | ***Exclude Marjolin's ulcer (SCC transformation, ~2% of chronic venous ulcers)*** [2] |

#### 5.7 Venous Ulcer-Specific Investigations

When a patient presents with a lower limb ulcer in the context of CVI:

1. **Duplex USG** — confirm venous aetiology and plan venous treatment
2. **ABPI** — exclude arterial component (mixed ulcers are common ~15%)
3. **Wound swab C/ST** — if signs of clinical infection (erythema, purulent discharge, cellulitis, systemic sepsis)
4. ***4-quadrant biopsy + palpate groin lymph nodes*** — if ulcer is chronic, non-healing, or has suspicious features (raised/everted edges, bleeding easily) → ***exclude Marjolin's ulcer*** [2][6]
5. **Bloods**: CBC, CRP, albumin, HbA1c

---

### 6. Summary of Investigation Algorithm

| Clinical Scenario | First-Line Investigation | Additional Investigations |
|---|---|---|
| **Symptomatic varicose veins (C2S)** | ABPI + Duplex USG | None usually needed |
| **CVI with skin changes (C4–C6)** | ABPI + Duplex USG | Bloods (CBC, CRP, albumin). Wound swab if infected. Biopsy if non-healing |
| **Recurrent varicose veins** | Duplex USG (essential — map the recurrence) | Consider CT/MR venography if complex anatomy |
| **Suspected secondary CVI** | Duplex USG + USG abdomen/pelvis | CT/MR venography for iliocaval pathology |
| **Young patient with DVT-related CVI** | Duplex USG + thrombophilia screen | CT venography if May-Thurner suspected |
| **Venous ulcer, non-healing** | ABPI + Duplex USG + wound swab + 4-quadrant biopsy | Exclude Marjolin's, mixed ulcer, vasculitis |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Diagnosis of varicose veins** requires visible dilated tortuous veins ≥ 3 mm in upright position PLUS demonstrable reflux (valve closure time > 0.5 s on duplex USG).

**CEAP** is the diagnostic framework: C = clinical inspection; E, A, P = require duplex USG to complete.

**Duplex USG is the gold standard** — it answers: Is there reflux? Where? Is the deep system competent? Is there DVT? Is the vein suitable for endovenous treatment?

**ABPI is mandatory before compression** — absolute contraindication if ABPI < 0.4. In diabetics with calcified arteries (ABPI > 1.3), use toe pressures instead.

**Tourniquet test**: No refilling below tourniquet = incompetence at tourniquet level. Rapid refilling despite tourniquet = incompetence below that level. Largely replaced by duplex but still examined.

**Perthes' test** assesses deep venous patency: tourniquet at SFJ + walking. If deep system is occluded → pain and swelling (superficial veins are the only outflow — do NOT ablate them).

**DVT is a contraindication to varicose vein surgery** — must always be excluded by duplex before any intervention.

**Combined deep + superficial incompetence → conservative management only** (surgery on superficial system would remove the patient's only functional outflow pathway).

**Non-healing venous ulcer → 4-quadrant biopsy** to exclude Marjolin's ulcer (SCC, 2%).
