## Differential Diagnosis of Salivary Gland Tumours

The differential diagnosis of a salivary gland swelling is one of the most commonly tested clinical reasoning exercises. The core challenge is this: **not every swelling in the salivary gland region is a salivary gland tumour**, and even if it is a salivary gland tumour, you need to distinguish benign from malignant. Let's think about this systematically from first principles.

When a patient presents with a mass in the parotid, submandibular, or oral cavity region, you must work through a structured differential. The approach depends on:

1. **Location** — which gland region? Is it truly arising from the gland or from adjacent structures?
2. **Laterality** — unilateral vs bilateral
3. **Tempo** — acute, subacute, or chronic
4. **Associated features** — pain, nerve involvement, skin changes, systemic symptoms

### A. Primary Salivary Gland Neoplasms (The "True" Differentials Among Tumour Types)

When you have confirmed a salivary gland mass is neoplastic, the differential is between the tumour subtypes. This is ultimately resolved by histology (FNA/core biopsy), but clinical features help narrow the differential:

| Feature | Pleomorphic Adenoma | Warthin's Tumour | Mucoepidermoid Ca | Adenoid Cystic Ca | Acinic Cell Ca | SCC | Carcinoma ex PA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Growth | Slow | Slow | Low-grade: slow; High-grade: rapid | Slow but relentless | Slow | Rapid | Sudden acceleration of long-standing mass |
| Pain | No | No | Low: No; High: ± | ***Yes — pain, paraesthesia*** [1] | Usually no | Yes | Variable |
| Facial nerve | Intact | Intact | Late involvement in high-grade | ***Facial weakness/paralysis*** [1] | Rare | Common | Common |
| Consistency | Firm, rubbery | Soft, fluctuant | Variable | Hard | Firm | Hard, stony | Hard within previously rubbery mass |
| Bilaterality | No | ***10% bilateral*** [2] | No | No | Rare | No | No |
| Key clue | Long-standing, tail of parotid | Smoker, older male, cystic on USS | Cystic on imaging if low-grade | Perineural invasion on MRI, submandibular gland | 2nd commonest parotid malignancy, favourable prognosis | ***Must rule out metastatic SCC and high-grade mucoepidermoid*** [1] | History of prior PA or long-standing parotid mass |

<Callout title="Key Clinical Reasoning">
The most important initial clinical question at the bedside is: **Is this benign or malignant?** The "red flags" for malignancy are: facial nerve palsy, rapid growth, pain/paraesthesia, fixation, skin involvement, and cervical lymphadenopathy [2]. If ANY of these are present, treat as malignant until proven otherwise.
</Callout>

### B. Non-Neoplastic Salivary Gland Conditions (Mimics of Salivary Gland Tumours)

These are critical differentials because they are **far more common** than salivary gland tumours and must be excluded before proceeding to tumour workup:

#### 1. ***Sialolithiasis (Salivary Gland Stones)*** [2]

- **Why it mimics a tumour**: A stone obstructing Wharton's or Stensen's duct causes **episodic swelling** of the gland that can become chronically enlarged and firm, mimicking a tumour
- **How to differentiate**: The hallmark is ***pain and swelling aggravated by eating*** (or even anticipation of eating) — because meals stimulate saliva production, increasing pressure behind the obstruction [6]. This waxing-and-waning pattern is **not** seen in tumours, which enlarge progressively
- ***80% occur in the submandibular gland*** [6] — because Wharton's duct is longer, runs against gravity, and submandibular saliva is more viscous (higher mucin content, higher calcium concentration)
- On examination, ***palpate the ducts for stones*** and ***express pus*** if infected [1]
- ***Chronic obstruction*** will eventually cause the gland to ***cease producing saliva***, and the ***gland will feel firm and may be mistaken for a focal mass*** with the patient being asymptomatic [6]

#### 2. ***Acute Bacterial Sialadenitis*** [3]

- ***Typically affects older adults, malnourished or post-operative patients*** [3] — reduced oral intake → reduced salivary flow → stasis → ascending bacterial infection via the duct
- ***Commonly caused by S. aureus*** [3]
- ***Characterized by sudden onset of a very firm and tender swelling*** with ***fever, chills and fairly marked systemic toxicity*** [3]
- ***Purulent discharge can be expressed from the affected duct orifice*** [3] — this is the key distinguishing sign from a tumour (tumours don't produce pus from the duct)
- **Why it mimics a tumour**: The acutely inflamed gland can be rock-hard due to oedema and cellulitis, mimicking a malignant mass. However, the acute onset, tenderness, fever, and pus from the duct all point to infection

#### 3. ***Chronic Bacterial Sialadenitis*** [3]

- ***Low-grade chronic infection that eventually leads to destruction of the salivary gland*** [3]
- ***Occurs more commonly in patients with decreased salivary secretion and increased mucus content in the saliva*** [3]
- ***Predisposing factors include stones, strictures and trauma*** [3]
- Results in a chronically enlarged, firm gland that can be very difficult to distinguish from a low-grade tumour on examination alone → imaging (USS/CT) and FNA are essential

#### 4. ***Chronic Sclerosing Sialadenitis (Kuttner's Tumour)*** [2]

- A specific form of chronic sialadenitis characterised by dense fibrosis and lymphocytic infiltration of the submandibular gland
- The name "Kuttner's tumour" itself tells you it mimics a neoplasm — it presents as a **hard, painless submandibular mass**
- Now increasingly recognised as part of the **IgG4-related disease** spectrum — check serum IgG4 levels
- **Why it mimics a tumour**: The fibrotic replacement makes the gland hard and irregular, essentially indistinguishable from submandibular gland carcinoma on palpation. FNA or biopsy is needed to make the distinction

#### 5. ***Viral Sialadenitis (Parotitis)*** [3]

- ***Commonly caused by mumps virus leading to acute pain and swelling of one or both parotid glands*** [3]
- ***Associated with non-specific prodrome consisting of low-grade fever, malaise, headache, myalgia and anorexia*** [3]
- **Why it's usually not confused with a tumour**: Bilateral involvement, acute onset, systemic symptoms, and self-limiting course (7–10 days) make this clinically distinct. However, unilateral viral parotitis in the early stages can briefly mimic a rapidly growing tumour
- Other viral causes: influenza, parainfluenza, coxsackievirus, EBV, CMV, HIV [7]

#### 6. ***Sjögren's Syndrome*** [2][3]

- ***Chronic inflammatory disorder characterized primarily by diminished lacrimal and salivary gland secretions resulting in symptoms of dry eyes and mouth (sicca complex)*** [3]
- ***Presents with a gradual swelling of parotid or submandibular glands, typically bilaterally*** [3]
- ***Autoimmune sialadenitis causes parenchymal destruction and dilation of intraglandular ducts*** [3]
- **Why it matters in the DDx of salivary gland tumour**: Sjögren's patients have a **15–20× increased risk of developing lymphoma** (MALT lymphoma) of the salivary gland. A unilateral, progressive enlargement of one gland in a known Sjögren's patient should raise suspicion for lymphomatous transformation
- Also associated with increased risk of other salivary gland tumours

#### 7. ***Salivary Cysts*** [2]

- Include mucoceles (from minor salivary glands), ranulas (sublingual gland retention cysts), and simple cysts of the major glands
- **Mucoceles**: painless, bluish, dome-shaped swellings on the lower lip (most common location) — caused by trauma to a minor salivary gland duct → extravasation of mucus into surrounding tissue
- **Ranulas**: translucent, bluish swelling in the floor of the mouth; a "plunging ranula" extends through the mylohyoid into the neck and can mimic a submandibular mass
- Usually soft/fluctuant on palpation, distinguishing them from solid tumours

#### 8. ***Lymphoepithelial Cysts*** [2]

- ***Benign cystic lesions*** of the parotid, particularly associated with **HIV infection**
- Bilateral parotid cystic enlargement in a young patient → think HIV-associated lymphoepithelial cysts
- Pathophysiology: HIV-driven reactive lymphoid hyperplasia within intraglandular lymph nodes leads to ductal obstruction → cyst formation
- On imaging, these appear as **multiple bilateral parotid cysts** — quite characteristic

---

### C. Non-Salivary Gland Pathology Presenting as a Salivary Gland Region Mass

These are lesions that are **not arising from the salivary gland** but present in the same anatomical region:

#### 1. ***Regional Lymphadenopathy*** [2]

- **This is the single most common mimic of a salivary gland tumour**, particularly in the submandibular and parotid regions
- ***It can be difficult to ascertain whether a mass is a parotid tumour versus parotid region lymph node*** [1]
- ***Cannot really differentiate between submandibular lymph nodes or submandibular gland tumour*** on palpation alone [1]
- Causes of lymphadenopathy:
  - **Reactive**: dental infections, pharyngitis, skin infections of the scalp/face
  - **Granulomatous**: tuberculosis (important in Hong Kong), sarcoidosis, cat-scratch disease
  - **Malignant**: lymphoma, metastatic SCC (from scalp/face/oral cavity), metastatic NPC (level II nodes mimicking parotid tail mass)

#### 2. ***Metastasis from Other Tumours*** [2]

- ***Metastatic SCC to intraglandular lymph nodes, usually from scalp SCC*** [1] — this is extremely important because the parotid contains intraglandular lymph nodes that drain the scalp, forehead, temple, and ear skin
- Cutaneous melanoma of the scalp/face can also metastasise to parotid nodes
- ***Metastatic H&N carcinoma is predominantly related to metastatic squamous cell carcinoma arising from the aerodigestive tract*** [5]
- Always examine the scalp, face, ears and oral cavity carefully in any patient with a parotid mass

<Callout title="Exam Pearl" type="idea">
A hard parotid mass in an elderly patient with a history of skin SCC or melanoma of the scalp is **metastatic disease to intraglandular lymph nodes until proven otherwise**. This is not a primary salivary gland tumour — it changes the management entirely (requires treatment of the primary cutaneous malignancy plus parotidectomy and neck dissection).
</Callout>

#### 3. ***Lymphoma*** [5]

- ***Tonsils and tongue base may be the presenting site for a lymphoma*** [5]
- Lymphoma can present as a parotid mass (arising from intraglandular lymph nodes) or as a submucosal oropharyngeal mass mimicking a minor salivary gland tumour
- ***Tissue diagnosis is required to make the diagnosis of a salivary gland tumour prior to definitive treatment whenever possible to avoid major surgery for a benign tumour or a lymphoma*** [2] — this point is critical because lymphoma is treated with chemotherapy/radiotherapy, NOT surgery. Performing a parotidectomy for what turns out to be lymphoma would be unnecessary morbidity
- MALT lymphoma of salivary glands is particularly associated with Sjögren's syndrome

#### 4. ***Parapharyngeal Space Tumours*** [8]

- ***Incidental finding; present during URTI; no trismus; 80% benign*** [8]
- These present as a medial bulge of the tonsillar pillar/soft palate on intraoral examination and can mimic a deep-lobe parotid tumour
- Include: deep lobe pleomorphic adenoma (most common), paragangliomas, schwannomas, neuromas
- The key distinguishing feature from a mucosal (minor salivary gland) tumour is that ***the overlying mucosa is normal*** (smooth) because the tumour is deep to the mucosa [8]

#### 5. ***Paraganglioma (Carotid Body Tumour / Chemodectoma)*** [5]

- ***Neoplasm arising from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells of the parasympathetic paraganglia*** [5]
- ***Pulsatile mass with a bruit on auscultation*** [5]
- ***Mobile in a side-to-side but not up-and-down direction (Fontaine's sign)*** [5] — because the carotid sheath allows lateral displacement but is tethered superiorly and inferiorly
- Located at the carotid bifurcation → can mimic a parotid tail or upper cervical mass
- ***Highly vascular and typically benign*** [5]

#### 6. ***Schwannoma*** [5]

- ***Neoplastic proliferation of Schwann cells; arise from any peripheral nerve and commonly from the vagus nerve or superior cervical sympathetic chain in the neck*** [5]
- ***Vagal schwannoma may cause hoarseness or aspiration*** [5]
- ***Sympathetic chain schwannoma may cause Horner's syndrome*** [5]
- Can present as a parapharyngeal or upper neck mass mimicking a salivary gland tumour

#### 7. ***Branchial Cleft Cyst*** [5]

- ***Accounts for 20% of paediatric neck masses*** [5]
- ***1st branchial cleft cyst*** passes through the parotid gland in close proximity to the facial nerve — directly mimics a parotid tumour [5]
- ***2nd branchial cleft cyst*** (most common) presents inferior to the angle of the mandible, anterior to SCM [5]
- ***Present in late childhood or early adulthood when a previously unrecognised cyst becomes infected*** [5]
- The key clue is the **age** (young patient), **location** (anterior to SCM), and **recurrent infections**

#### 8. Lipoma and Skin Lesions [5]

- ***Lipoma***: ***benign neoplasm comprised of fat; typically asymptomatic and presents as soft, ill-defined, slowly enlarging mass*** [5] — easily distinguished from a salivary gland tumour by its soft consistency and superficial location
- ***Epidermoid inclusion cyst, dermoids, or pilomatrixoma*** can also present as masses in the salivary gland region [5]
- ***Confirm the lesion is not arising from the skin*** on palpation [1] — if the mass moves with the skin, it's a skin/subcutaneous lesion, not a salivary gland tumour

#### 9. Masseter Hypertrophy / Bruxism [2]

- ***Bruxism (excess teeth grinding or jaw clenching)*** [2] and ***masseter hypertrophy*** [2] can cause bilateral parotid-region fullness
- Distinguished by: bilateral, no discrete mass, hypertrophied masseter palpable as a firm muscle bulk (ask the patient to clench their jaw), no abnormality on imaging of the parotid gland itself

---

### D. ***Differential Diagnosis of Bilateral Parotid Swelling*** [2]

Bilateral parotid swelling has a specific differential that is quite different from unilateral parotid masses. The unifying concept is that bilateral swelling almost always represents a **systemic or metabolic condition**, not a tumour (with the notable exception of Warthin's tumour):

| Condition | Mechanism | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Parotitis*** (viral) [2] | Viral infection of both glands | Acute, painful, febrile, self-limiting |
| ***Sjögren's syndrome*** [2][3] | Autoimmune destruction of salivary glands | Dry eyes + dry mouth, bilateral gradual swelling, ANA/anti-Ro/anti-La positive |
| ***Sialadenosis*** [2] | ***Non-inflammatory, non-neoplastic hypertrophy of salivary gland; usually bilateral and painless*** | Associated with: ***anorexia/bulimia nervosa (self-induced vomiting), alcoholic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus*** [2] |
| ***Sarcoidosis*** [3] | ***Granulomatous infiltration*** of both parotids | ***Bilateral painless parotid enlargement***, may have Heerfordt syndrome (uveoparotid fever: parotitis + uveitis + facial nerve palsy + fever) |
| ***Drug-induced*** [2] | ***e.g., Phenytoin*** | Bilateral, painless, medication history |
| ***Bruxism / Masseter hypertrophy*** [2] | Mechanical hypertrophy | Bilateral fullness, no discrete mass, clench test |
| ***Warthin's tumour*** [2] | ***Bilateral in 10%*** | Older male smoker, soft/fluctuant |
| ***HIV lymphoepithelial cysts*** | Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia | Bilateral cystic parotid enlargement, young patient, check HIV status |

<Callout title="Clinical Rule" type="error">
A common exam mistake is to forget that **bilateral parotid swelling is almost never a primary salivary gland tumour** (except Warthin's tumour). Always think of systemic causes — sialadenosis, Sjögren's, sarcoidosis, viral parotitis, HIV — before considering neoplasia. If the examiner says "bilateral painless parotid enlargement," think metabolic/autoimmune first.

### E. Differentiating Oral Cavity Masses (Minor Salivary Gland Tumour vs Other Pathology)

***Minor salivary gland tumours may present as submucosal masses in the tongue base and soft palate*** [5]. The DDx of a submucosal oral cavity/oropharyngeal mass includes:

| Diagnosis | Key Features |
|---|---|
| Minor salivary gland tumour | Submucosal, ***normal overlying mucosa (smooth)*** [8][9], hard palate most common, painless unless malignant |
| ***Lymphoma*** [5] | ***Tonsils and tongue base may be the presenting site*** — rubbery, may be bilateral, systemic B symptoms |
| Oral cavity SCC | ***Ulcerative mucosal lesion*** [9], not submucosal; associated with smoking, alcohol, betel nut |
| Mucocele | Lower lip, bluish, fluctuant, young patient |
| Pleomorphic adenoma of palate | ***Lateral palate, submucosal mass*** [1], firm, painless, well-circumscribed |
| Deep extension of maxillary sinus tumour | ***May present with nasal symptoms*** [8] |

> ***Histology of oral cavity malignancy: epithelium (ulcerative) = SCC/adenocarcinoma; underlying structure (smooth overlying mucosa) = lymphoma/minor salivary gland tumour*** [9]. This distinction based on mucosal surface is a high-yield clinical pearl.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Differential Diagnosis — Key Points for Exams:**

1. ***Not all parotid masses are salivary gland tumours*** — always consider lymphadenopathy, metastatic disease (especially scalp SCC to intraglandular parotid nodes), and lymphoma [1][2][5]
2. ***Tissue diagnosis (FNA/core biopsy) is required before definitive surgery*** to avoid performing a parotidectomy for lymphoma (which needs chemo/RT, not surgery) [2]
3. ***Cannot really differentiate submandibular LN from submandibular gland tumour on palpation alone*** [1] — imaging is essential
4. ***Bilateral parotid swelling → think systemic***: sialadenosis (bulimia, cirrhosis, DM), Sjögren's, sarcoidosis, viral parotitis, HIV cysts, drug-induced, bruxism [2]
5. ***Sialolithiasis***: waxing-and-waning pain with eating; 80% submandibular; can cause chronic gland enlargement mimicking tumour [6]
6. ***Kuttner's tumour***: chronic sclerosing sialadenitis (IgG4-related) mimicking submandibular carcinoma — hard, painless [2]
7. ***1st branchial cleft cyst*** passes through the parotid gland near the facial nerve — directly mimics a parotid tumour in young patients [5]
8. ***Parapharyngeal mass with normal overlying mucosa*** suggests deep-lobe tumour, paraganglioma, or schwannoma — NOT a mucosal primary [8]
9. ***Oral cavity submucosal smooth mass*** = minor salivary gland tumour or lymphoma; ***ulcerative mucosal mass*** = SCC [9]
10. ***Carotid body tumour*** is pulsatile, has a bruit, and is mobile side-to-side but not up-and-down (Fontaine's sign) [5]
