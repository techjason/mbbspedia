# Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

---

## 1. Definition

***Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)*** is defined as the **benign (non-malignant) proliferation of both glandular epithelial and stromal tissues** within the **transitional zone** of the prostate gland, resulting in progressive nodular enlargement of the prostate [1][2][3].

Let's break the name down:
- **Benign** = non-cancerous (i.e., cells proliferate but do not invade or metastasize)
- **Prostatic** = relating to the prostate gland
- **Hyperplasia** = ↑ number of cells (as opposed to *hypertrophy*, which means ↑ cell size)

This is an important distinction: BPH is a **hyperplastic** process — there are genuinely *more cells*, not just bigger cells. The enlarged prostate mechanically compresses the prostatic urethra, producing **lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)**. However — and this is a critical clinical pearl — ***not all LUTS is due to BPH, and ≥1/3 of men with LUTS do NOT have bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)*** [4].

<Callout title="Key Concept" type="error">
BPH ≠ LUTS ≠ BOO. These are three overlapping but distinct entities. A man can have histological BPH without symptoms, LUTS without BPH (e.g., overactive bladder), or BOO without BPH (e.g., urethral stricture). Always think beyond BPH when evaluating LUTS.

## 2. Epidemiology

### 2.1 Prevalence and Incidence

- ***Histological BPH begins at ~age 30*** and increases with age [3]:
  - **8% at 31–40 years**
  - **40–50% at 51–60 years**
  - ***>80% at >80 years*** [3]
- However, **only ~10% of men with histological BPH present with clinical symptoms** [3]. This makes sense: the prostate can enlarge without necessarily compressing the urethra enough to cause symptoms.
- ***~50% of patients at age 50 have LUTS related to BPH*** [2][5].
- ***Typical symptomatic age: 50–80 years*** — the prostate starts increasing in size at ~age 40 and becomes symptomatic around 50 [5].

### 2.2 In Hong Kong

- BPH is the most common cause of LUTS in older men in Hong Kong.
- With an ageing population, the burden of BPH and its complications (AROU, urinary retention, obstructive uropathy) continues to rise.
- ***AROU (acute retention of urine) is the most common urological emergency***, with **BPH accounting for ~53% of male AROU** cases [4].
- AROU incidence in males: **7/1,000 men per year**; 10% in men in their 70s and ~30% in men in their 80s over a 5-year period [4].

## 3. Risk Factors

***The etiology and risk factors for BPH include*** [1]:

| Risk Factor | Explanation |
|---|---|
| ***1. Age*** | The single most important risk factor. Histological BPH is virtually universal in very old men. Prostate growth is a continuous process from ~30 years onward. Androgen exposure over decades drives cumulative hyperplasia [1][3]. |
| ***2. Race*** | Higher prevalence in Black men (larger prostate volumes, earlier symptom onset) compared to Asian men. However, with westernised diets and ageing populations, prevalence in Asia is converging [1]. |
| ***3. Diet*** | Western diets (high fat, high red meat) are associated with ↑ BPH risk. The mechanism is likely related to obesity and metabolic syndrome effects on hormonal milieu [1]. |
| ***4. Metabolic syndrome*** | HTN, dyslipidaemia, obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM are all associated with ↑ BPH severity. Hyperinsulinaemia may stimulate prostatic growth factors. Sympathetic overactivity in metabolic syndrome also ↑ dynamic component of obstruction [1]. |
| ***5. Genetics (role unclear)*** | Familial clustering is observed. Men with a first-degree relative with BPH requiring surgery before age 60 have a 4× risk. The exact genetic loci remain unclear [1]. |
| ***6. Growth factors (basic fibroblastic GF, insulin-like GF, etc.)*** | These are androgen-dependent growth factors that mediate the stromal–epithelial interaction driving hyperplasia (detailed below) [1]. |
| ***Androgens (DHT)*** | Absolutely essential. Castrated men and those with 5α-reductase deficiency do NOT develop BPH — proving the androgen-dependent nature of the disease [3]. |

<Callout title="High Yield – Risk Factors from Lecture">
***Risk factors for BPH per the lecture: Age, Race, Diet, Metabolic syndrome, Genetics (role unclear), Growth factors (bFGF, IGF, etc.)*** [1]. The Olmsted County Study showed that ***rates of AROU increase with increasing age, increasing prostate size, increasing BPH symptoms, and decreasing maximal urine flow rate*** [6].

## 4. Anatomy and Function of the Prostate

### 4.1 Basic Anatomy

The prostate is a **walnut-sized exocrine gland** (~20g in a young adult) located **inferior to the bladder base**, **anterior to the rectum**, and **surrounding the proximal (prostatic) urethra**. It sits within the **true pelvis**, anchored by the **puboprostatic ligaments**.

The **prostatic urethra** runs through the centre of the gland — this is why prostatic enlargement causes urinary obstruction (the urethra is literally being squeezed).

**Key anatomical relations:**
- **Superior:** bladder neck
- **Inferior:** urogenital diaphragm (external urethral sphincter)
- **Posterior:** rectum (this is why we can palpate the prostate on DRE)
- **Lateral:** levator ani muscles
- **Anterior:** symphysis pubis, Santorini venous plexus

### 4.2 Zonal Anatomy (McNeal Classification)

This is **extremely high-yield** because different diseases affect different zones:

| Zone | % of Glandular Tissue | Key Relations | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Anterior zone (Anterior fibromuscular stroma)*** | Non-glandular | Covers anterior surface | ***Fibromuscular, not glandular*** — no BPH or cancer here [2] |
| ***Central zone*** | ~25% | ***Surrounds ejaculatory ducts*** | Rarely affected by cancer (<8%) [2] |
| ***Transitional zone*** | ~5–10% (young) | Surrounds proximal prostatic urethra | ***Common site of BPH (median lobe)*** — this zone undergoes massive expansion in BPH [2] |
| ***Periurethral zone*** | Small glands | ***Surrounds prostatic urethra*** directly | Also involved in early BPH nodule formation [2] |
| ***Peripheral zone*** | ~70% | Posterolateral aspect | ***Common site of prostate cancer and inflammation (posterior lobe)*** — palpable on DRE [2] |

<Callout title="Why BPH is Symptomatic but Prostate Cancer Often Isn't (Early On)">
***BPH arises in the transitional zone*** — right around the urethra. So even moderate enlargement compresses the urethra and causes voiding symptoms early.

***Prostate cancer arises in the peripheral zone*** — far from the urethra. It can grow silently for years before it's large enough to compress the urethra or invade surrounding structures. This is why ***prostate cancer usually presents late with symptoms since it is located at the posterior aspect*** [2].
</Callout>

### 4.3 Function of the Prostate

- Produces **prostatic fluid** (~30% of seminal volume), which contains:
  - **Prostate-specific antigen (PSA):** a serine protease that liquefies the seminal coagulum post-ejaculation
  - **Citric acid, zinc, fibrinolysin, and prostatic acid phosphatase**
- Prostate growth and function depend on **androgens**, specifically ***dihydrotestosterone (DHT)***, which is converted from testosterone by the enzyme ***5α-reductase*** within the prostate [2][3].

### 4.4 Hormonal Regulation

```
Testes → Testosterone → (5α-reductase in prostate) → DHT
                                                        ↓
                                           Binds androgen receptors
                                           on epithelial + stromal cells
                                                        ↓
                                           Stimulates cell proliferation
                                           and inhibits apoptosis
```

- Both **prostatic epithelial cells** and **stromal cells** express **androgen receptors** and depend on DHT for growth [2].
- Two isoforms of 5α-reductase exist:
  - **Type 1:** found in skin, liver (minor role in prostate)
  - **Type 2:** predominant in prostate — this is the therapeutic target of **5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs)** like finasteride (type 2 selective) and dutasteride (dual type 1+2)

## 5. Etiology and Pathophysiology

### 5.1 Etiology

The precise etiology is ***incompletely understood*** but is generally considered ***androgen-dependent*** [3][5]. Key etiological concepts:

1. ***Increased proliferation: reawakening of embryonic processes in prostatic stroma which induces epithelial cell proliferation*** [1] — during embryological development, the urogenital sinus mesenchyme instructs prostatic budding. In BPH, a similar stromal–epithelial interaction is "switched back on" in adulthood, driving glandular growth.

2. ***Decreased apoptosis*** [1] — it's not just that more cells are being born; fewer cells are dying. The net result is tissue accumulation.

3. ***Mediated by androgen-dependent growth factors*** [1]:
   - ***TGF (transforming growth factor)***
   - ***IGF (insulin-like growth factor)***
   - ***EGF (epidermal growth factor)***
   - ***bFGF (basic fibroblastic growth factor)***

4. ***Initial micronodule formation in the transitional zone and periurethral region, later fusing to become macronodules*** [1] — this explains the progressive, nodular enlargement pattern seen histologically and on imaging.

### 5.2 Pathophysiology — The Three-Component Model

The pathophysiology of symptomatic BPH can be elegantly understood through **three components** [3][5]:

#### Component 1: Bladder Outlet Obstruction (BOO)

BOO from BPH has ***two sub-components***:

| Component | Mechanism | Therapeutic Target |
|---|---|---|
| ***Static component*** | ***Stromal hyperplasia mediated by DHT via 5α-reductase*** → mechanical compression of urethra by enlarged prostate tissue [5] | ***5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs)*** — reduce DHT → shrink prostate volume by ~20-30% over 6-12 months |
| ***Dynamic component*** | ***Smooth muscle hypertrophy and contraction mediated by α1-adrenergic receptors*** → functional narrowing of prostatic urethra [5] | ***α1-adrenergic blockers*** — relax smooth muscle → ↓ functional obstruction → rapid symptom relief (days to weeks) |

**Why are there two components?** The prostate stroma contains a large proportion of **smooth muscle cells** with abundant **α1-adrenergic receptors** (especially the α1A subtype). Sympathetic nervous system activation (e.g., during stress, cold, or with sympathomimetic drugs) causes contraction of this smooth muscle, worsening obstruction *dynamically* on top of the fixed *static* mechanical compression. This is why men with BPH notice worse symptoms when they're stressed, cold, or taking decongestants (which are α-agonists).

#### Component 2: Detrusor Response and Overactive Bladder (OAB)

- Chronic BOO leads to **compensatory detrusor hypertrophy** (the bladder muscle works harder to push urine past the obstruction).
- This hypertrophy causes:
  - ***Detrusor instability / overactive bladder*** — explaining the **storage (irritative) symptoms** (frequency, urgency, nocturia) seen in BPH [5]
  - **Trabeculated bladder** — visible thickening of bladder wall with interlacing muscle bundles
  - **Bladder diverticula** — mucosa herniates between hypertrophied muscle bundles (these are "false" or "pulsion" diverticula)
- ***Up to 30–60% of BOO patients develop secondary detrusor overactivity*** — postulated to be due to ↑intravesical pressure → tissue ischaemia → smooth muscle injury and cholinergic denervation supersensitivity [4]

#### Component 3: Complications of Chronic Obstruction

Chronic urinary stasis (↑ post-void residual volume) leads to:
- **Recurrent UTI** (stagnant urine is an excellent culture medium)
- **Bladder stones** (urinary stasis → crystallisation)
- **Overflow incontinence** (bladder so full it "overflows")
- **Upper tract dilatation (hydronephrosis)** → **obstructive uropathy** → **renal impairment**

## 6. Classification

### 6.1 Histological vs Clinical BPH

| Aspect | Histological BPH | Clinical BPH |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Microscopic evidence of hyperplasia | Symptomatic LUTS attributable to BPH |
| Prevalence | Very high (>80% men >80y) | Much lower (~10% of those with histological BPH) |
| Clinical relevance | None unless symptomatic | Drives management decisions |

### 6.2 Classification by Symptom Severity (IPSS)

The ***International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)*** is used to **quantify the severity of LUTS** [4][5]:

- Involves **7 questions** covering:
  - ***Voiding symptoms:*** incomplete emptying, intermittency, weak stream, straining
  - ***Storage symptoms:*** frequency, urgency, nocturia
- Each question scored 0–5 (total 0–35)
- Plus a **quality of life (QoL) question** scored 0–6

| IPSS Score | Severity |
|---|---|
| ***1–7*** | ***Mild*** |
| ***8–19*** | ***Moderate*** |
| ***20–35*** | ***Severe*** |

<Callout title="IPSS Is NOT Diagnostic" type="error">
***IPSS is used to quantify severity of LUTS, predict treatment response, guide treatment decisions, and monitor response to treatment — it is NOT a diagnostic tool*** [4]. A high IPSS does not mean the patient has BPH; it means they have significant LUTS. The cause still needs to be determined.
</Callout>

### 6.3 LUTS Classification by Phase

***Traditional LUTS classification: "FUN" + "DISH"*** [5]:

| Phase | Type | Mnemonic | Symptoms | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***Storage phase*** | ***Irritative*** | **F**requency, **U**rgency, **N**octuria | ***Frequency*** (尿频), ***Urgency*** (尿急) ± urge incontinence, ***Nocturia*** (夜尿) | Detrusor overactivity (secondary to BOO), local pathology (stone, UTI, tumour), systemic causes (↑ fluid intake, polyuria from DM/DI) |
| ***Voiding phase*** | ***Obstructive*** | **D**ribbling, **I**ntermittent, **S**training, **H**esitancy | ***Dribbling*** (尿末滴漏), ***Intermittent stream*** (尿流斷續), ***Incomplete emptying*** (尿意未盡), ***Straining*** (谷), ***Hesitancy*** (等尿), ***Weak stream*** | BOO from BPH (static + dynamic), urethral stricture, CA prostate; or bladder hypocontractility (nerve or detrusor muscle problem) |

- ***BPH typically presents with both obstructive and irritative symptoms, with obstructive symptoms predominating*** [5]
- ***Bladder outlet obstruction typically presents with predominantly voiding symptoms*** [2]
- ***Overactive bladder typically presents with predominantly storage symptoms*** [2]

### 6.4 Retention of Urine Classification

| Type | Onset | Pain | Mechanism | Typical Cause |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ***Acute retention of urine (AROU)*** | ***Sudden*** | ***Painful*** | ***Normal innervation*** — bladder tries to contract but can't overcome obstruction | ***BPH***, drugs, constipation [4] |
| ***Chronic retention of urine (CROU)*** | Gradual | ***Usually painless*** | ***Abnormal innervation*** — detrusor hypocontractility, loss of sensation | ***DM*** (diabetic cystopathy), neurogenic bladder [4] |

---

## 7. Clinical Features

### 7.1 Symptoms

#### A. Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS)

***BPH presents with LUTS: both obstructive and irritative symptoms, with obstructive >> irritative*** [5].

**Voiding (Obstructive) Symptoms — "DISH + Weak Stream":**

| Symptom | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hesitancy*** (等尿) | Delay in initiation of urinary stream | Detrusor must generate ↑ pressure to overcome obstruction; takes longer to build up sufficient pressure to open the compressed urethra |
| ***Weak stream*** | Reduced force and calibre of urinary stream | BOO (static + dynamic) → ↑ urethral resistance → reduced flow rate for any given detrusor pressure |
| ***Straining*** (谷) | Need to use abdominal muscles to void | ***Higher bladder pressure is needed*** to overcome obstruction; patient recruits Valsalva manoeuvre to augment intravesical pressure [5] |
| ***Intermittency*** (尿流斷續) | Stream starts and stops | Detrusor fatigue during prolonged voiding against high resistance; detrusor contracts in waves rather than sustained contraction. Also associated with ***residual urine*** [5] |
| ***Terminal dribbling*** (尿末滴漏) | Dribbling at end of micturition | ***Weakened pelvic floor*** + residual urine in prostatic urethra that drains by gravity after detrusor relaxes [5] |
| ***Incomplete emptying*** (尿意未盡) | Sensation of residual urine after voiding | Genuinely elevated post-void residual (PVR) due to inability of detrusor to completely empty bladder against obstruction |

**Storage (Irritative) Symptoms — "FUN":**

| Symptom | Description | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| ***Frequency*** (尿频) | Voiding >8 times/day | Incomplete emptying → ↓ functional bladder capacity; secondary detrusor overactivity from BOO; local irritation from UTI/stone |
| ***Urgency*** (尿急) | Sudden, compelling desire to void that is difficult to defer | ***Detrusor overactivity*** — uninhibited detrusor contractions secondary to BOO-induced bladder wall remodelling (ischaemia → denervation supersensitivity) [4] |
| ***Nocturia*** (夜尿) | Waking ≥1 time at night to void | Multifactorial: ↓ functional bladder capacity, detrusor overactivity, ↑ nocturnal urine production (loss of circadian ADH rhythm in elderly), nocturnal polyuria from CHF/renal disease |
| ***Urge incontinence*** | Involuntary leakage associated with urgency | Severe detrusor overactivity overwhelming sphincter resistance |

#### B. Complications-Related Symptoms

| Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Gross haematuria*** | ***Ruptured dilated bladder neck veins*** — chronic BOO causes congestion and dilatation of submucosal veins at the bladder neck and prostatic urethra. These fragile veins rupture, causing painless haematuria [4][5] |
| ***Fever, dysuria*** | ***Recurrent UTI*** — urinary stasis (↑ PVR) provides a static pool for bacterial colonisation and growth [5] |
| ***Strangury*** (painful, frequent urination of small volumes with straining) | ***Bladder/urethral stones*** — urinary stasis → crystal nucleation and growth → stones irritate bladder mucosa [4] |
| ***Uraemic symptoms*** (nausea, fatigue, anorexia, pruritus) | ***Obstructive uropathy*** → bilateral hydronephrosis → ↓ GFR → accumulation of uraemic toxins |
| ***Overflow incontinence*** | ***Chronic retention*** — bladder is so distended that intravesical pressure exceeds urethral resistance; urine "overflows" in small amounts, often without sensation |
| ***Sudden, painful inability to void*** | ***AROU*** — acute-on-chronic obstruction, often precipitated by a trigger (see below) |

#### C. Precipitating Factors for AROU in BPH

***Common precipitating factors*** [4]:

| Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Constipation** | Rectal distension directly compresses the prostatic urethra (***usually NOT a standalone aetiology but rather a precipitating factor with background prostatic enlargement*** [4]) |
| **UTI** | Pain → reflex urethral sphincter spasm → ↑ outflow resistance |
| **Anaesthesia or analgesia** (especially opioids, anticholinergics) | ↓ detrusor contractility (anticholinergic effect); opioids also ↑ sphincter tone |
| **Immobility** | ***Poor voiding when supine*** — gravitational assistance for voiding is lost [4] |
| **Painful perianal conditions** (thrombosed haemorrhoids, perianal abscess) | Reflex inhibition of micturition from perineal pain |
| **Excessive fluid intake** (especially ***alcohol***) | Alcohol: diuresis (ADH suppression) + sedation + smooth muscle relaxation of detrusor; combined rapid bladder filling with impaired detrusor contraction |
| ***Drugs*** | **Sympathomimetics** (e.g., pseudoephedrine in cold remedies): ↑ α1-stimulation → ↑ dynamic obstruction. **Anticholinergics**: ↓ detrusor contraction. **Diuretics**: rapid bladder filling. **Calcium channel blockers**: ↓ detrusor contraction |

<Callout title="Drug-Precipitated AROU" type="idea">
Always ask about **over-the-counter cold medications** in a man presenting with AROU. Pseudoephedrine (a sympathomimetic α-agonist found in many decongestants) directly worsens the dynamic component of BOO. Similarly, first-generation antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine) have strong anticholinergic effects that impair detrusor contraction.
</Callout>

### 7.2 Signs

#### A. General Examination

| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| **General condition / neurological assessment** | Rule out neurological causes of LUTS (e.g., PD, stroke, MS, spinal cord disease — these can cause detrusor overactivity or underactivity) [4] |
| **Signs of chronic kidney disease** | Pallor, uraemic frost (rare), fluid overload — suggesting obstructive uropathy from chronic BPH |

#### B. Abdominal Examination

| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| ***Distended bladder*** (palpable/percussible suprapubic mass) | Suggests urinary retention (acute or chronic). In AROU, the bladder is **tender**; in CROU, it is often **non-tender** because the sensory stretch fibres have been chronically desensitised [4] |
| **Loin tenderness / ballotable kidneys** | May suggest hydronephrosis from chronic obstruction |

#### C. Genital Examination

| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| ***Phimosis*** | Tight foreskin can itself cause BOO — must be checked as a co-contributor [5] |
| **Meatal stenosis** | Another potential cause of BOO |
| **Urethral discharge** | Suggests urethritis → consider urethral stricture as alternative cause of LUTS |

#### D. Digital Rectal Examination (DRE)

This is **the most important physical examination** in a man with LUTS. DRE assesses:

| DRE Finding in BPH | Significance |
|---|---|
| ***Smooth, enlarged prostate (>3 finger breadths)*** | Consistent with BPH; normal prostate is ~2 FB [5] |
| ***Non-tender*** | BPH is typically non-tender. Tenderness suggests prostatitis |
| ***Median sulcus present*** | The median sulcus (groove between left and right lobes) is preserved in BPH but may be obliterated in advanced BPH or prostate cancer [5] |
| ***Rubbery / firm-elastic consistency*** | Consistent with benign tissue. Hard/nodular/irregular consistency raises concern for ***prostate cancer*** |
| ***Anal tone intact*** | Important to assess — reduced anal tone suggests neurological cause (e.g., cauda equina syndrome, which can cause urinary retention) [5] |
| **Rectal pathology** | Assess for rectal masses, loaded rectum (constipation as precipitant) |

<Callout title="DRE Pearls" type="idea">
- DRE **underestimates** prostate size — it only palpates the posterior surface (peripheral zone). A prostate that feels "normal" on DRE can still have significant transitional zone enlargement causing obstruction.
- A **hard, irregular, nodular** prostate with **loss of median sulcus** should raise alarm for ***prostate cancer*** → check PSA, consider biopsy.
- Always document anal tone — a lax anal sphincter in a patient with urinary retention is a **red flag for cauda equina syndrome** (surgical emergency!).
</Callout>

#### E. Summary of Clinical Presentation by Level of Complication

***Complications of BPH can be understood by level*** [5]:

| Level | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Prostate level*** | ***Bleeding (ruptured dilated bladder neck veins)*** | Chronic congestion → venous dilatation → rupture |
| ***Bladder level*** | ***AROU*** | Acute-on-chronic obstruction, often precipitated |
| | ***Recurrent UTI*** | Urinary stasis (↑ PVR) → bacterial growth |
| | ***Bladder stone*** | Urinary stasis → crystal nucleation |
| | Diverticulum | Mucosal herniation through hypertrophied detrusor |
| | ***Chronic retention ± overflow incontinence*** | Progressive detrusor failure against chronic obstruction |
| ***Upper tract level*** | ***Recurrent hydronephrosis*** | Back-pressure from chronically full bladder → ureteral obstruction |
| | Obstructive uropathy | Bilateral hydronephrosis → parenchymal damage |
| | ***Renal failure*** | End-stage consequence of bilateral obstructive uropathy |

## 8. Approach to Evaluation — History and Physical Examination

### 8.1 History-Taking Framework

***Approach to LUTS evaluation*** [4]:

1. **LUTS characterisation:** onset, duration, severity, storage vs voiding predominance
2. **Other urinary symptoms:** haematuria, pain, dysuria
3. **Sexual history:** associated urethritis, urethral strictures
4. **Past medical history:** 
   - Complete ***drug history*** (drugs causing retention!)
   - History of ***neurological disease*** (stroke, PD, MS, SCI, DM)
   - Previous urological surgery or instrumentation
5. ***Bladder diary for ≥3 days*** — especially important if frequency/nocturia are prominent [4][5]
6. **Assessment of complications:** episodes of retention, UTI, haematuria, renal impairment
7. ***IPSS questionnaire*** — quantifies symptom severity and QoL impact [4][5]

### 8.2 Physical Examination Checklist

1. **General:** neurological screen (gait, lower limb neurology)
2. **Abdomen:** distended bladder (palpation + percussion)
3. ***Genitalia:*** phimosis, meatal stenosis
4. ***DRE:*** anal tone, prostate size/consistency/tenderness, median sulcus, rectal pathology [5]
