## Complications of BPH

Understanding complications of BPH requires you to think in terms of **what happens upstream when there's a chronic downstream obstruction**. Picture a garden hose with someone stepping on it — pressure builds up behind the blockage, the hose distends, and eventually the entire system upstream fails. That's exactly what happens from the prostatic urethra backward through the bladder, ureters, and kidneys.

### 1. Organising Framework — Complications by Anatomical Level

***Complications of BPH*** [8][5]:
- ***Acute retention of urine (AROU)***
- ***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis***
- ***Bladder stones***
- ***Recurrent UTI***
- ***Renal failure***

These can be organised by the level of the urinary tract affected, moving from the prostate upward [5]:

| Level | Complications |
|---|---|
| ***Prostate level*** | ***Bleeding (ruptured dilated bladder neck veins)*** [5] |
| ***Bladder level*** | ***AROU***, chronic retention of urine (CROU) ± ***overflow incontinence***, ***recurrent UTI***, ***bladder stones***, bladder diverticula, detrusor hypertrophy/failure, hernia (from chronic straining) [3][5] |
| ***Upper tract level*** | ***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis*** (recurrent), obstructive uropathy (pyelonephrosis), ***renal failure*** [3][5][8] |

Let me now walk through each complication in detail, explaining the pathophysiology from first principles.

### 2. Prostate-Level Complications

#### 2.1 Haematuria from BPH

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic BOO causes **venous congestion** at the bladder neck and prostatic urethra. The submucosal veins dilate and become fragile. These ***ruptured dilated bladder neck veins*** bleed, producing painless gross or microscopic haematuria [3][5] |
| **Clinical features** | Typically painless, intermittent gross haematuria. May present with clot retention (clots block the bladder outlet → acute inability to void) |
| **Important caveat** | ***Haematuria should be worked up for other pathologies, especially CA (bladder and renal), even if the patient has known BPH*** [3]. BPH-related haematuria is a **diagnosis of exclusion** — you must rule out malignancy first with cystoscopy, upper tract imaging, and urine cytology |
| **Management** | Mild: observation. Severe/clot retention: 3-way Foley catheter + continuous bladder washout (CBW). Medical: 5ARI (finasteride/dutasteride) → ↓ prostatic vascularity → ↓ bleeding. Refractory: surgical intervention (TURP) |

<Callout title="Never Assume Haematuria Is 'Just BPH'" type="error">
An elderly man with known BPH presenting with haematuria is at the peak age for bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Always perform a full haematuria workup (cystoscopy, CT urogram, urine cytology) before attributing haematuria to BPH. Missing a CA bladder is a serious medicolegal pitfall.

### 3. Bladder-Level Complications

#### 3.1 Acute Retention of Urine (AROU)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Sudden, painful inability to void despite a full bladder [4] |
| **Epidemiology** | ***Untreated symptomatic BPH has 2.5%/year risk of AROU*** [3]. BPH accounts for ~53% of male AROU [4] |
| **Mechanism** | The combination of static (tissue bulk) and dynamic (smooth muscle tone) obstruction reaches a critical threshold — often triggered by a **precipitating factor** that tips the balance. The detrusor, already working hard against chronic obstruction, can no longer generate enough pressure to overcome the outflow resistance → complete failure to void |
| **Precipitating factors** | Constipation, UTI, anaesthesia/analgesia (opioids, anticholinergics), immobility, alcohol, sympathomimetics (cold medications), painful perianal conditions [4] |
| **Clinical features** | Acute suprapubic pain, palpable/percussible tender bladder, inability to pass urine. Agitated patient |
| **Why it's painful** | Innervation is intact → stretch receptors in the bladder wall fire maximally → severe visceral pain. This contrasts with CROU where chronic stretch has desensitised the afferents |

**Acute management of AROU** [4][8]:

1. ***Immediate bladder decompression*** — urethral catheterisation (14-16 Fr Foley) [4]
2. **Monitor first catheterisation volume:** ***> 500 mL = genuine AROU; > 1000 mL = possible chronic retention*** [8]
3. **Send urine for C/ST** [4]
4. **Anticipate complications of decompression** (see Section 3.2 below)
5. **Start α-blocker** (tamsulosin) at time of catheterisation [3][4]
6. ***Trial without catheter (TWOC)*** after 1-2 weeks [3][4]:
   - ***Success (20-40%):*** perform urodynamic evaluation for confirmation of BOO [3]
   - ***Failure:*** recatheterise → try again 2 weeks later [3]
7. ***Failed TWOC ×2*** → consider [3][4]:
   - ***Elective TURP:*** usually ***≥ 4-6 weeks from AROU*** (↓ risk of bleeding and infection) [4]
   - ***Clean intermittent self-catheterisation (CISC):*** as bridge to surgery; advantages include ↑ rate of spontaneous voiding and ↓ complications vs indwelling catheter [3]
   - ***Long-term catheterisation:*** not preferred — associated with ***risk of UTI/urosepsis, trauma, stones, urethral strictures, prostatitis, and squamous cell carcinoma of bladder*** [3]

#### 3.2 Complications of Bladder Decompression (After Catheterisation)

These are complications that occur **after you relieve the obstruction** — a separate but related set of problems:

##### A. Post-Obstructive Diuresis (POD)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | ***Diuresis > 200 mL/h for ≥ 2 hours*** [3][4][8] or > 3L urine in 24 hours [3] |
| **Mechanism** | ***Tubular damage → ↓ concentrating ability → rapid fluid and solute loss*** [3]. During chronic obstruction, back-pressure causes renal tubular injury (especially the medullary concentrating gradient). Once obstruction is relieved, the damaged tubules cannot reabsorb sodium and water properly → massive diuresis. Also represents a **physiological response to excrete excess fluid retained during obstruction** [3][8] |
| **Risk** | ***Primarily a problem of chronic but not acute retention*** [8] — because chronic retention has had time to accumulate excess fluid and cause tubular damage |
| **Dangers** | May result in **hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia** if not monitored [3] |
| **Management** | ***Close monitoring of I/O and fluid/electrolyte status*** [3]. ***Patients normally can manage by increasing oral fluid intake, but isotonic saline replacement is required if unable to do so*** [8]. Aim to replace **half of urine output in the past hour** [3]. ***Do NOT remove Foley catheter*** during POD [8] |

##### B. Haemorrhage Ex-Vacuo

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | ***Bladder mucosal disruption with sudden emptying of a greatly distended bladder*** [3] — the stretched mucosa tears as the bladder rapidly collapses |
| **Significance** | ***Usually self-limiting, rarely significant*** [3] |
| **Management** | Observation. Rarely needs intervention |

##### C. Transient Hypotension

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | ***Vagovagal response or relief of pelvic venous congestion*** [3] — the distended bladder was compressing pelvic veins, maintaining venous return. Sudden decompression → pooling of blood in pelvic veins → ↓ venous return → ↓ cardiac output → hypotension |
| **Management** | IV fluids, Trendelenburg position, monitoring. Usually transient |

#### 3.3 Chronic Retention of Urine (CROU) and Overflow Incontinence

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Gradual, painless accumulation of large volumes of residual urine (often > 1000 mL) with vague lower abdominal distension [4] |
| **Why painless** | Unlike AROU, CROU develops slowly. The bladder wall stretches gradually → sensory stretch receptors adapt and desensitise → patient loses the urgency sensation. This is especially common in patients with **diabetic cystopathy** (autonomic neuropathy → afferent nerve damage) [4] |
| **Overflow incontinence** | ***Superimposed in CROU with ↑↑ PVR in bladder*** [3] — the bladder is so full that intravesical pressure exceeds the urethral closing pressure, and urine "leaks" past the obstruction in small amounts. The patient paradoxically complains of **incontinence** (urine dribbling) despite having a full bladder they cannot empty |
| **Danger** | Silent upper tract damage — because there's no pain, patients may present late with advanced hydronephrosis and renal impairment |

#### 3.4 Recurrent UTI

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic urinary stasis (↑ PVR) creates a **static pool** of warm urine — an ideal culture medium for bacteria. The stagnant urine is not flushed out by normal voiding, allowing bacterial colonisation and ascension [5][8] |
| **Risk factors** | ↑ PVR, instrumentation (catheterisation), bladder stones (bacteria adhere to stone surface forming biofilms) |
| **Clinical features** | Dysuria, frequency, urgency (irritative symptoms), fever, cloudy/foul-smelling urine. May precipitate AROU (UTI-related pain → reflex sphincter spasm → acute obstruction) |
| **Management** | Treat acute UTI with antibiotics guided by C/ST. Address underlying obstruction (medical or surgical treatment of BPH). Reduce PVR |

#### 3.5 Bladder Stones

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Urinary stasis → urine becomes supersaturated with solutes → crystal nucleation → stone growth. The stagnant urine in the bladder has prolonged contact time with dissolved minerals, allowing crystallisation. Additionally, recurrent UTI (especially with urease-producing organisms like Proteus) can alkalinise urine → struvite stone formation [5][8] |
| **Clinical features** | ***Strangury*** (***painful, frequent urination of small volumes, expelled slowly only by straining despite severe urgency and feeling of incomplete emptying*** [4]). Intermittent stream (stone acts as **ball-valve** at bladder neck → stream cuts off suddenly when stone falls into outlet). Terminal haematuria |
| **Investigation** | KUB X-ray (radio-opaque stones), USG bladder, cystoscopy |
| **Management** | Cystolitholapaxy (endoscopic stone fragmentation and removal) + definitive BPH surgery. Stone removal alone without addressing the obstruction → stone recurrence |

#### 3.6 Bladder Diverticula

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic BOO → detrusor hypertrophy → ↑ intravesical pressure during voiding → bladder mucosa herniates **between** the hypertrophied muscle bundles, forming outpouchings. These are ***"pulsion" or "false" diverticula*** (only mucosa herniates, no muscular wall) |
| **Significance** | Diverticula cannot empty properly (no muscle to contract) → stasis within the diverticulum → ↑ risk of UTI, stone formation, and rarely **squamous cell carcinoma** developing within the diverticulum |
| **Detection** | Cystoscopy, CT/USG |

#### 3.7 Detrusor Changes — Hypertrophy and Eventual Failure

This is a key pathophysiological progression that explains why BPH can go from "bothersome" to "dangerous":

| Stage | What Happens | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| **Compensated** | Detrusor hypertrophies to overcome ↑ outflow resistance. Generates higher pressures to push urine past obstruction | Voiding symptoms present but patient can still empty bladder (PVR low). Trabeculated bladder on cystoscopy |
| **Decompensated** | Prolonged strain → muscle fibre replacement by collagen → detrusor fibrosis → **loss of contractile function** | ↑↑ PVR, CROU, overflow incontinence. At this point, even removing the obstruction (TURP) may not restore normal voiding because the detrusor itself is damaged — the patient may need long-term CISC |

<Callout title="Detrusor Failure — Point of No Return" type="idea">
There's a therapeutic window in BPH management. If you treat the obstruction while the detrusor is still compensated (hypertrophied but functional), the bladder recovers after TURP. But if you wait too long and the detrusor becomes fibrotic and decompensated, surgical relief of obstruction won't restore voiding function. This is one reason why we don't just watch all BPH patients indefinitely — timely intervention matters.
</Callout>

#### 3.8 Hernia

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | ***Hernia due to chronic straining*** [3] — repeated Valsalva manoeuvre during voiding chronically raises intra-abdominal pressure → weakens the abdominal wall → inguinal hernia |
| **Significance** | Often overlooked as a BPH complication. Ask about groin swelling in men with chronic voiding symptoms |

---

### 4. Upper Tract Complications

#### 4.1 Hydroureter and Hydronephrosis

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Chronic high intravesical pressure (from BOO) is transmitted retrograde up the ureters → ureteric dilatation (hydroureter) → renal pelvic dilatation (hydronephrosis). The vesicoureteric junction (VUJ) normally prevents reflux, but chronically elevated bladder pressures can overwhelm this mechanism |
| **Clinical features** | Often **silent** in chronic cases. May present with loin pain/fullness. Bilateral in BPH (obstruction is at the bladder outlet, affecting both sides). Can be complicated by **pyelonephrosis** (infected hydronephrosis) → fever, loin pain, sepsis [3] |
| **Investigation** | USG kidneys (most sensitive for detecting hydronephrosis), RFT, CT if complicated |
| **Management** | Relieve obstruction (catheterisation → definitive BPH surgery). If pyelonephrosis → urgent drainage (nephrostomy) + IV antibiotics |

#### 4.2 Obstructive Uropathy and Renal Failure

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Bilateral hydronephrosis → sustained ↑ pressure in the renal pelvis → compression of renal parenchyma → ↓ GFR → progressive renal impairment. Tubular function is affected early (↓ concentrating ability → polyuria, a seemingly paradoxical finding in obstruction). Glomerular function is affected later (↑ creatinine, uraemia) |
| **Why polyuria occurs** | Chronic obstruction damages the **medullary concentrating gradient** (countercurrent mechanism). The kidneys produce large volumes of dilute urine despite overall ↓ GFR — this is called **obstructive polyuria** or the "polyuric phase" of obstructive uropathy |
| **Clinical features** | Uraemic symptoms: nausea, anorexia, fatigue, pruritus, confusion. ***Ask for loin pain, fever, polyuria/oliguria/uraemic symptoms*** [3]. May present with **post-renal AKI** |
| **Investigation** | RFT (↑ creatinine, ↑ urea, ↑ K+), USG (bilateral hydronephrosis, cortical thinning), renal scintigraphy (DMSA for split renal function) |
| **Management** | Emergency: catheterisation to relieve obstruction → monitor for POD → correct electrolytes. Definitive: BPH surgery once medically optimised |
| **Prognosis** | If caught early (before cortical thinning/atrophy), renal function can recover after obstruction is relieved. If chronic with cortical loss → **irreversible CKD** |

---

### 5. Treatment-Related Complications (TURP Complications)

These are complications of the surgical treatment itself, not of BPH, but are essential to know:

***TURP complications*** [11][3]:

#### 5.1 Early Complications of TURP

***Significant complications in ~15-20%, mortality in 0.2-2.5%*** [3]:

| Complication | Mechanism | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding*** | Resection of vascular prostatic tissue, open venous sinuses | ***3-7% require transfusion*** [3]. Post-op: 3-way Foley + continuous bladder irrigation with NS to prevent clot retention [5] |
| ***Infection and urosepsis*** | Urethral instrumentation introduces bacteria | Prophylactic antibiotics mitigate. Rarely life-threatening |
| ***Incontinence (1%)*** [11] | Damage to external urethral sphincter during resection | Devastating if occurs. Careful resection below the verumontanum is critical |
| ***Strictures or bladder neck stenosis*** [11] | Mechanical/thermal injury from resectoscope passage (urethral stricture) or post-operative scarring at bladder neck | Urethral stricture from instrumentation; bladder neck stenosis from contracture |
| ***Perforation → fistula*** [11] | Over-resection through prostatic capsule into surrounding structures | ***Can form fistula*** [5] — e.g., rectoprostatic fistula |
| ***Retrograde ejaculation*** | ***Due to resection of bladder neck*** [5][11] — the bladder neck normally closes during ejaculation to propel semen antegrade. Post-TURP, the widened neck stays open → semen flows backward into bladder | ***40-60%*** [3] (some sources 70-80% [5]). ***Penile erection and sexual function are rarely affected*** [3]. Must counsel pre-operatively regarding fertility implications |
| ***Erectile dysfunction*** [11] | Thermal/mechanical damage to cavernous nerves along prostatic capsule | ***5%*** [3]. Uncommon |
| ***TUR syndrome*** [11] | ***Dilutional hyponatraemia due to systemic absorption of glycine*** during ***monopolar TURP*** | See detailed breakdown below |

##### TUR Syndrome — Detailed

***TUR syndrome (< 1%)*** [3]:

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Pathophysiology** | ***Irrigation fluids used in monopolar TURP (1.5% glycine) are hypotonic*** [3]. Open venous sinuses in the resected prostatic bed absorb this fluid into the systemic circulation → ***dilutional hyponatraemia + ↓ osmolarity*** [3]. ***Aggravated by post-operative stress-related ADH release leading to antidiuresis*** [3]. Glycine itself is neurotoxic (inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS and retina) |
| **Risk factors** | ***Long operating time*** [5], massive prostate, low irrigation pressure not maintained, monopolar (not bipolar) technique |
| **Timing** | ***Na+ lowest 1-2 hours after surgery, but slowly rises afterwards due to glycine uptake into cells*** [3] |
| **Symptoms** | ***Nausea (first symptom)*** [5], ***confusion, hypertension, visual disturbance (flashing lights), giddiness, seizures, cerebral oedema*** [3][5] |
| **Prevention** | ***Avoid non-conductive irrigants: use bipolar technique (NS as irrigation fluid) → no TUR syndrome*** [11]. ***Limit operation time to < 1 hour*** [3]. ***Irrigation pressure < 60 mmHg*** [5]. ***Monitor fluid absorbed: glycine deficit by irrigation and suction → halt procedure at absorption thresholds*** [3] |
| **Management** | ***Stop OT immediately + Na replacement (hypertonic saline if symptomatic) + Lasix (furosemide)*** [3]. Monitor electrolytes, serum osmolality, volume status [5] |

<Callout title="Bipolar TURP Eliminates TUR Syndrome">
***Bipolar TURP uses normal saline as the irrigation fluid*** because the current flows between two electrodes at the instrument tip (not through the patient's body). This completely ***eliminates the risk of TUR syndrome*** [11]. This is the main advantage of bipolar over monopolar. However, bipolar is ***slower with poorer haemostasis and smaller probes*** [3], so monopolar is still used when speed matters for smaller prostates.
</Callout>

#### 5.2 Late Complications of TURP

| Complication | Incidence | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bladder neck stenosis and urethral strictures*** | ***7-8%*** [3] | Post-surgical scarring and contracture at resection sites; urethral trauma from repeated instrumentation |
| ***Urinary incontinence*** | ***2%*** [3] | Late stress incontinence from sphincter damage. ***Urge incontinence (early) → stress incontinence (late)*** [5] |
| ***Regrowth of prostate*** | ***5% need re-operation in 5 years*** [3] | BPH is a hyperplastic process that continues as long as androgens are present. TURP removes tissue but the remaining transitional zone can re-grow |
| ***Ejaculatory dysfunction*** | ***40-60%*** | Retrograde ejaculation persists (permanent anatomical change at bladder neck) |
| ***Erectile dysfunction*** | ***5%*** [3] | Cavernous nerve injury |

#### 5.3 Complications of Long-Term Catheterisation

For patients managed with indwelling catheters (Foley or SPC) as a bridge or definitive treatment:

***Problems of long-term catheterisation*** [3]:
- ***UTI / urosepsis*** — biofilm formation on catheter surface
- ***Trauma*** — urethral erosion, meatal stenosis
- ***Encrustation and stones*** — mineral deposits on catheter and in bladder
- ***Urethral strictures*** — chronic irritation
- ***Prostatitis***
- ***Squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder*** — chronic irritation → squamous metaplasia → malignant transformation (rare, but significant with very long-term catheter use > 10 years)

---

### 6. Endoscopic Enucleation of Prostate (EEP) — Complications in Context

***Endoscopic enucleation of prostate (EEP)*** is the standard for ***large prostate > 80g*** [11] and has important advantages in terms of complications:

***Advantages of EEP (HoLEP/BipolEP) over TURP*** [11]:
- ***Less bleeding*** — ***enucleation plane between adenoma and prostate capsule*** [11] produces less raw surface bleeding than piecemeal TURP resection
- ***Shorter catheterisation time*** [11]
- ***More radical resection of BPH nodule*** [11] — removes the entire adenoma rather than scraping pieces off
- ***Better improvement in uroflowmetry parameters (Qmax and RU)*** [11]
- ***Lower chance of recurrence / need for repeat intervention*** [11] — because more tissue is removed
- ***Similar complication rate*** [11] to TURP overall
- ***As effective as open simple prostatectomy with lower morbidities*** [11]

---

### 7. Summary — Complications at a Glance

| Level | Complication | Key Mechanism | Is This a Surgical Indication? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prostate | Haematuria | Ruptured dilated bladder neck veins | ***Yes — if recurrent*** |
| Bladder | ***AROU*** | Acute-on-chronic obstruction, often precipitated | ***Yes — if refractory (failed TWOC)*** |
| | CROU ± overflow incontinence | Chronic obstruction with detrusor failure | Yes (relative) |
| | ***Recurrent UTI*** | Urinary stasis → bacterial colonisation | ***Yes*** |
| | ***Bladder stones*** | Urinary stasis → crystallisation | ***Yes*** |
| | Bladder diverticula | Mucosal herniation through hypertrophied detrusor | Not usually on its own |
| | Hernia | Chronic straining | No |
| Upper tract | ***Hydronephrosis*** | Retrograde pressure transmission from BOO | ***Yes*** |
| | ***Renal failure*** | Bilateral hydronephrosis → parenchymal compression | ***Yes*** |
| Treatment | TUR syndrome | Glycine absorption → hyponatraemia + fluid overload (monopolar) | N/A |
| | Retrograde ejaculation | Bladder neck resection | N/A |
| | Urethral stricture | Instrumentation injury | N/A |
