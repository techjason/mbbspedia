## Complications of Urinary Stones

Urinary stones can be thought of as causing harm through three fundamental mechanisms: **obstruction**, **infection**, and **direct tissue injury**. Every complication listed below stems from one — or a combination — of these three mechanisms. Understanding this triad from first principles lets you predict, recognise, and manage complications logically.

### 1. ***Infection: Pyelonephritis, Pyonephrosis, and Urosepsis*** [1][2]

#### Pathophysiology — from stone to sepsis

The chain of events:
1. A stone lodges in the ureter → **obstruction** → urine pools above the stone → **stasis**
2. Stagnant urine is an excellent culture medium → bacteria (from ascending UTI or haematogenous seeding) multiply unchecked
3. Bacteria ascend from the stagnant urine into the renal parenchyma → ***pyelonephritis*** (infection of the kidney)
4. If the collecting system fills with pus under pressure → ***pyonephrosis*** ("pyo" = pus, "nephros" = kidney) — this is essentially an empyema of the renal pelvis
5. Bacteria and endotoxins enter the bloodstream through the infected, inflamed, and congested renal parenchyma → ***urosepsis*** → can rapidly progress to **septic shock and multi-organ failure** if not decompressed

> This is the single most dangerous acute complication of urinary stones. An obstructed infected system is a **closed-space infection under pressure** — analogous to an undrained abscess. Antibiotics alone cannot sterilise a system where pus has no way out.

#### Clinical Features
- **Pyelonephritis**: high spiking fever, rigors, loin pain, renal angle tenderness (Murphy's kidney punch positive), nausea/vomiting, tachycardia, leukocytosis with left shift
- **Pyonephrosis**: similar to pyelonephritis but more toxic-appearing; may have palpable ballotable kidney due to massive distension with pus; ***requires urgent decompression*** [1] — this is the indication for PCN or JJ stent, ***NOT just pyelonephritis*** [1]
- **Urosepsis**: features of sepsis (fever/hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypotension, altered mental status, raised lactate) in the setting of urinary tract infection. Can evolve to **septic shock** with cardiovascular collapse

#### Management
- ***IV antibiotics*** — broad-spectrum (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam, or ceftriaxone + metronidazole; cover Pseudomonas if healthcare-associated) guided by local sensitivities
- ***Urgent decompression*** by PCN (preferred in septic shock — quicker, bedside) or JJ stent [3]
- ***Definitive stone removal is deferred until sepsis has completely resolved*** [1]
- Resuscitation: IV fluids, inotropes if needed, ICU admission for multi-organ support

<Callout title="Pyonephrosis vs Pyelonephritis — Key Distinction" type="error">
***Pyonephrosis (pus under pressure in an obstructed collecting system) requires urgent drainage. Pyelonephritis alone (without obstruction) does NOT require drainage — antibiotics suffice.*** [1] The critical difference is whether there is obstruction. Always check for hydronephrosis on USG/NCCT in febrile patients with stones. Pyonephrosis = pus + obstruction = surgical emergency.
</Callout>

#### Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis (XGP) [6]

This is a rare but important chronic complication, particularly relevant in Hong Kong exam material:

- ***A chronic destructive granulomatous process*** that typically occurs with long-standing obstruction (often by a staghorn calculus) + chronic infection
- ***Characterised by lipid-laden macrophages (xanthoma cells)*** — "xantho" = yellow (from lipid content), "granulomatous" = granuloma formation [6]
- ***CT shows classic "bear's paw" appearance*** — an enlarged non-functioning kidney with dilated calyces containing stones, surrounded by inflammatory tissue replacing normal parenchyma [6]
- The kidney is essentially destroyed and non-functional
- ***Treatment: nephrectomy*** — the kidney cannot be salvaged [6]

---

### 2. ***Obstruction: Hydroureter, Hydronephrosis, and Obstructive Nephropathy*** [1][2]

#### Pathophysiology — step by step

1. Stone lodges at a point of ureteric narrowing (PUJ, pelvic brim, VUJ) → partial or complete obstruction
2. Urine produced by the kidney cannot pass → **back-pressure** builds up
3. The ureter dilates upstream → ***hydroureter***
4. The renal pelvis and calyces dilate → ***hydronephrosis*** [2]
5. If obstruction persists, the rising intraluminal pressure is transmitted to the renal parenchyma → compresses the renal tubules and microvasculature → **ischaemia** + **direct pressure-induced tubular damage** → ***obstructive nephropathy***
6. ***Scarring around the stone or post-obstructive effects*** can maintain hydronephrosis even after the stone passes [2]

#### Acute vs Chronic

| Feature | Acute Obstruction | Chronic Obstruction |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Duration | Hours to days | Weeks to months |
| Reversibility | Fully reversible if relieved promptly | May be irreversible if prolonged |
| Renal damage | Minimal if decompressed early | ***Cortical thinning, parenchymal atrophy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis*** |
| Clinical picture | Severe pain, acute hydronephrosis | May be painless (slowly progressive dilation), chronic hydronephrosis, progressive renal impairment |

#### Clinical Features of Hydronephrosis
- May be asymptomatic (especially if chronic and unilateral — the contralateral kidney compensates)
- Dull aching flank pain (from capsular distension)
- ***Rarely ballotable kidneys*** [3] (only in massive hydronephrosis/pyonephrosis)
- On imaging: dilated pelvicalyceal system on USG; perinephric stranding and dilated system on NCCT

#### Management
- Identify and relieve obstruction (PCN or JJ stent for urgent cases; definitive stone removal for the cause)
- Monitor renal function (serial RFT)
- ***Radioisotope scintigraphy (MAG3/DTPA)*** for differential renal function if prolonged obstruction → ***kidney with < 15% of total renal function is non-functional and not worth salvaging → consider nephrectomy*** [1]

---

### 3. ***Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)*** [1][2][7]

#### Pathophysiology

AKI from urolithiasis is a **post-renal** (obstructive) cause [7]:

- ***Urinary stones*** are listed as a cause of ***post-renal AKI*** due to obstructive uropathy [7]
- For a stone to cause clinically significant AKI, obstruction must be **bilateral**, or the stone must obstruct a **solitary functioning kidney** (e.g., the other kidney was previously removed or is congenitally absent/non-functional). Why? Because a single functioning kidney can maintain adequate GFR — unilateral obstruction alone rarely causes AKI
- Exception: bilateral staghorn calculi → bilateral obstruction → ***may present with chronic renal failure*** [3]
- ***However, prolonged post-renal disease will progress to become tubulointerstitial fibrosis, i.e., intrinsic renal disease*** [7] — so early decompression is critical

#### Clinical Features [7]
- ***Oliguria (< 0.5 mL/kg/h)***: important early sign
- ***↑ Creatinine, hyperkalaemia ± hyponatraemia***
- ***Fluid overload: oedema, hypertension***
- Anuria: complete bilateral obstruction

#### Management [7][8]
- ***Ensure and manage ABC***
- ***Consider and reverse post-renal disease***: palpable bladder, blocked catheter, hydronephrosis on imaging
- ***Urgent decompression*** (PCN or JJ stent)
- ***Management of life-threatening complications***:
  - ***Hyperkalaemia*** (K > 6 → ECG monitoring; IV calcium gluconate for membrane stabilisation, insulin-dextrose, salbutamol nebuliser, polystyrene sulphonate; dialysis if refractory)
  - ***Fluid overload*** (IV furosemide; dialysis if refractory)
  - ***Metabolic acidosis*** (IV bicarbonate; dialysis if refractory)
- ***Haemodialysis*** if indications met (AEIOU: Acidosis, Electrolytes, Intoxication, Overload, Uraemia) [8]

<Callout title="Post-Renal AKI is Reversible — If Caught Early">
***Recognising post-renal AKI is particularly important because it is often rapidly reversible compared to intrinsic renal disease*** [7]. A simple USG showing bilateral hydronephrosis + rising creatinine should trigger urgent decompression — the reward is restoration of renal function that would otherwise be permanently lost.
</Callout>

### 4. ***Post-Obstructive Diuresis*** [2][5]

This is a complication that occurs **after** the obstruction is relieved — an important concept to understand and anticipate.

#### Pathophysiology
- During prolonged obstruction, the kidney accumulates solute and water that it could not excrete
- Additionally, the high back-pressure damages the tubular concentrating mechanism (medullary washout, impaired aquaporin expression, decreased sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle)
- When obstruction is relieved, two things happen simultaneously:
  1. **Physiological diuresis**: the kidney excretes the accumulated backlog of urea, sodium, and water — this is **appropriate** and self-limiting
  2. **Pathological diuresis**: damaged tubules cannot concentrate urine properly → massive, persistent, dilute urine output → risk of **dehydration, hypovolaemia, and electrolyte disturbances**

#### Definition [5]
- ***Post-obstructive diuresis: > 200 mL/h urine × ≥ 2 hours, or > 3 L urine in 24 hours*** [5]

#### Clinical Features and Risks
- ***Hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypovolaemia*** [5]
- Dehydration, hypotension
- Can be life-threatening if not recognised and replaced

#### Management [2][5]
- ***Close monitoring of intake/output (chart urine output every 2 hours)*** [5]
- ***Fluid and electrolyte status monitoring with appropriate replacement and resuscitation*** [5]
- ***Prefer oral hydration; aim to replace half of urine output in the past hour*** [5]
- Do NOT over-replace — excessive IV fluids can perpetuate the diuresis. Match roughly 50–75% of urine output
- Usually resolves within 24–48 hours as tubular function recovers

---

### 5. ***Haematuria*** [2][3]

#### Pathophysiology
- The stone's rough surface (particularly ***calcium oxalate with its irregular "mulberry" shape and sharp projections*** [3]) directly traumatises the urothelium → bleeding
- Can be gross (visible red urine) or microscopic (detected on dipstick/microscopy)
- ***Haematuria is the single most discriminating predictor of kidney stone in unilateral flank pain (apart from passage of stones)*** [3]
- Present in ***~95% of symptomatic ureteric stone episodes*** [3]

#### Clinical Significance
- Usually self-limiting once the stone passes or is removed
- Persistent or significant haematuria after stone treatment may indicate:
  - Mucosal injury from instrumentation (URS, PCNL)
  - Residual stone fragments
  - Coexisting pathology (e.g., bladder cancer — ***always consider in patients > 35 with gross haematuria***)
- ***Haemorrhage ex-vacuo (transient haematuria)***: occurs after sudden emptying of a greatly distended bladder → ***bladder mucosal disruption with sudden emptying*** [5] — usually self-limiting, rarely significant

---

### 6. ***Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)*** [4]

#### Pathophysiology
- ***Prolonged obstruction → tubulointerstitial fibrosis*** [7] → irreversible renal parenchymal damage → CKD
- Particularly relevant in:
  - **Bilateral staghorn calculi**: chronic bilateral obstruction → progressive loss of renal function
  - ***Nephrocalcinosis***: chronic deposition of calcium in the renal parenchyma (e.g., in hyperparathyroidism, distal RTA) → ***may result in CKD if chronic*** [4]
  - **Recurrent stones** with repeated episodes of obstruction and infection → cumulative scarring
- ***Primary hyperparathyroidism renal complications include: renal stone, nephrocalcinosis, tubular dysfunction, CKD*** [4]

---

### 7. ***Ureteric Stricture*** [1][3]

#### Pathophysiology
- Chronic impaction of a stone against the ureteric wall → persistent inflammation → fibrosis → **cicatricial narrowing** (stricture) of the ureteric lumen
- Also an iatrogenic complication of stone treatment: ***ureteric stricture is a late complication of URS (0.1%)*** [3]; can also occur after prolonged JJ stent placement or ESWL with steinstrasse
- Once a stricture forms, it becomes a new point of obstruction → predisposes to recurrent hydronephrosis and stone formation in a vicious cycle

#### Management
- Balloon dilatation (endoscopic)
- Endoureterotomy (incision of the stricture)
- Ureteric reimplantation (for distal strictures)
- Boari flap or ileal ureter interposition (for long strictures)

---

### 8. ***Complications of Stone Treatment Procedures***

These are iatrogenic complications that are important to know for exam purposes:

#### ESWL Complications [1]
| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Incomplete fragmentation*** | Stone too hard (> 1000 HU) or too large for effective shock wave energy delivery |
| ***Steinstrasse ("stone street")*** | Multiple stone fragments stack in the ureter post-ESWL → ureteric obstruction. "Stein" = stone, "Strasse" = street (German) |
| ***Perinephric or subcapsular haematoma*** | Shock waves damage renal parenchymal microvasculature → bleeding into the perirenal space or under the renal capsule |
| ***Urosepsis*** | Fragmentation of an infected stone releases bacteria into the bloodstream |

#### PCNL Complications [1][3]
| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Access failure (5%)*** | Cannot establish percutaneous tract into the collecting system |
| ***Bleeding requiring transfusion (7%)*** | Puncture through vascularised parenchyma; all renal arteries are end-arteries → no collateral compensation |
| ***Hydrothorax (15% if supracostal)*** | ***If the supracostal puncture tract traverses the lower pleura → irrigating fluid enters the pleural space*** [1] |
| ***Bowel perforation (< 1%)*** | ***5% of the population have a retrorenal colon*** → at risk during posterior access [3] |
| ***Urosepsis (fever 10%, sepsis 1%)*** | ***Flushing bacteria into the bloodstream*** during manipulation of infected stones [2] |
| ***Mortality (< 0.5%)*** | Cumulative risk from the above |

#### URS/RIRS Complications [1][3]
| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Ureteral perforation (1.7%)*** | Scope or laser energy perforates the thin ureteric wall |
| ***Ureteral avulsion (0.1%)*** | Excessive traction during stone basket extraction tears the ureter off — catastrophic |
| ***Urosepsis (1.1%)*** | ***Endoscopic irrigation can force bacteria into renal parenchyma*** → bacteraemia [1] |
| ***Ureteric stricture (0.1%)*** | Late fibrosis from mucosal injury/thermal damage |
| ***Persistent VUR (0.1%)*** | Damage to the VUJ anti-reflux mechanism during instrumentation |

---

### 9. ***Recurrence*** [3]

#### Pathophysiology
- Urolithiasis is fundamentally a **chronic, recurrent disease** driven by underlying metabolic, dietary, and genetic predispositions that persist after the acute episode is treated
- Unless the modifiable risk factors are addressed, the same conditions that formed the first stone will form the next

#### Statistics [3]
- ***Risk of recurrence after 1st stone: ~15% at 1 year, 35–40% at 5 years, 50% at 10 years***
- This is precisely why **metabolic evaluation and secondary prevention** are essential — not optional

#### Prevention
- See Management section (Phase 3: Secondary Prevention) for detailed stone-type-specific measures

### Summary Table — Complications at a Glance

| Complication | Mechanism | Key Clinical Feature | Urgency |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| ***Urosepsis*** | Obstruction + infection → bacteria enter bloodstream | Fever, rigors, hypotension, tachycardia | **Emergency** — urgent decompression |
| ***Pyelonephritis*** | Ascending infection from stagnant urine | High fever, loin pain, renal angle tenderness | Urgent — antibiotics ± decompression |
| ***Pyonephrosis*** | Pus under pressure in obstructed collecting system | Toxic patient, ballotable kidney | **Emergency** — urgent drainage |
| ***XGP*** | Chronic obstruction + infection → granulomatous destruction | Non-functioning kidney, "bear's paw" on CT | Elective — nephrectomy |
| ***Hydronephrosis*** | Back-pressure from obstruction | May be painless if chronic; cortical thinning on imaging | Semi-urgent — decompress to preserve function |
| ***AKI*** | Bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney obstruction | Oliguria/anuria, rising Cr, hyperkalaemia | **Emergency** — urgent decompression |
| ***CKD*** | Prolonged/recurrent obstruction → tubulointerstitial fibrosis | Progressive ↓ GFR, small kidneys | Chronic — prevent further damage |
| ***Post-obstructive diuresis*** | Damaged tubular concentrating mechanism after relief | Massive urine output, electrolyte derangement | Monitor closely after decompression |
| ***Ureteric stricture*** | Chronic inflammation/fibrosis from impacted stone or instrumentation | Recurrent obstruction, hydronephrosis | Elective — endoscopic or surgical repair |
| ***Haematuria*** | Mucosal trauma by stone surface | Pink/red urine, positive dipstick | Usually self-limiting |
| ***Steinstrasse*** | Stone fragments pile up in ureter post-ESWL | Recurrent colic after ESWL | May need URS if symptomatic |
| ***Recurrence*** | Persistent underlying metabolic risk factors | Another stone episode | Long-term — metabolic evaluation + prevention |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Three fundamental mechanisms of stone complications**: Obstruction, Infection, Direct Tissue Injury.

**Most dangerous complication**: Urosepsis from an obstructed infected system → septic shock → multi-organ failure. Requires urgent decompression (PCN or JJ stent) + IV antibiotics. Never attempt definitive stone surgery until sepsis resolved.

**Pyonephrosis ≠ Pyelonephritis**: Pyonephrosis = pus under pressure in an obstructed system → requires drainage. Pyelonephritis without obstruction → antibiotics alone.

**AKI from stones is post-renal**: Requires bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney. Reversible if decompressed early. Prolonged obstruction → tubulointerstitial fibrosis → CKD (irreversible).

**Post-obstructive diuresis**: > 200 mL/h × 2h or > 3 L/day after relief of obstruction. Risk of dehydration and electrolyte disturbance. Monitor I/O closely; replace ~50% of urine output.

**XGP**: Chronic destruction by staghorn stone + infection → lipid-laden macrophages → "bear's paw" on CT → nephrectomy.

**Recurrence**: 50% at 10 years. Metabolic evaluation (24h urine) and secondary prevention are mandatory.

**Treatment complications to know**: ESWL → Steinstrasse, haematoma; PCNL → bleeding (7%), hydrothorax (supracostal), bowel perforation; URS → perforation, avulsion, stricture.
