## Diagnostic Criteria, Algorithm, and Investigations for Urinary Stones

### Diagnostic Criteria — Establishing the Diagnosis

Unlike many medical conditions (e.g., rheumatic fever with Jones criteria, or SLE with ACR/EULAR criteria), urolithiasis does **not** have a formal set of "diagnostic criteria" with scoring systems. Instead, the diagnosis is established by a combination of:

1. **Clinical presentation** (history and physical examination)
2. **Confirmation by diagnostic imaging** (the definitive step)
3. **Supportive laboratory findings**

In practice, the diagnosis of an acute ureteric stone is made when all three components converge:

| Component | What Establishes Diagnosis | Explanation |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **History** | Acute colicky loin-to-groin pain + haematuria ± N/V ± irritative LUTS | The clinical picture is highly suggestive but not pathognomonic — many conditions can mimic it (see DDx section) |
| **Physical Examination** | Symptoms out of proportion to signs, renal angle tenderness, no peritoneal signs, restlessness [3] | Helps narrow the differential and exclude surgical abdomen |
| ***Diagnostic Imaging*** | ***Direct visualisation of the stone on imaging (NCCT is the gold standard)*** [1][2][3] | **This is the definitive diagnostic step**. A stone must be SEEN on imaging to confirm the diagnosis. Clinical suspicion alone is insufficient for treatment planning |
| **Urinalysis** | Haematuria (gross or microscopic), ± pyuria, ± crystals | Supportive but not diagnostic — haematuria is absent in ~15% of confirmed stones (if completely obstructed, no urine flows past the stone to carry RBCs). Pyuria can be reactive |
| **Blood Tests** | CBC, RFT, Ca²⁺, PO₄³⁻, urate | For assessing complications (infection, renal impairment) and underlying causes — not diagnostic of the stone itself |

<Callout title="Diagnosis = Imaging" type="idea">
The bottom line: you cannot diagnose a urinary stone without imaging. A patient with classic renal colic but no stone on NCCT does NOT have a confirmed stone — you must rethink the differential.
</Callout>

### The Clinical Approach — A Step-by-Step Framework

***The clinical approach to urolithiasis involves four sequential steps*** [3]:

1. ***Establish the diagnosis*** based on history, physical examination, and ***diagnostic imaging (most important)***
2. ***Acute treatment***: conservative vs ESWL vs PCNL vs URS ± JJ stent
3. ***Establish the type of stone*** based on:
   - ***Stone composition analysis*** if stone is collected
   - ***Metabolic evaluation*** to evaluate underlying metabolic predisposing factors
4. ***Secondary prevention*** based on underlying predisposing factors

This section focuses on **Steps 1 and 3** (diagnosis and metabolic evaluation). Steps 2 and 4 will be covered in the Management section.

### Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

The investigations for urolithiasis serve three purposes:
1. **Confirm the stone and plan treatment** (imaging)
2. **Assess for complications** (infection, obstruction, renal impairment)
3. **Identify the underlying cause/stone type** (metabolic workup)

---

#### A. Imaging Investigations

##### 1. ***Non-Contrast CT Abdomen + Pelvis (NCCT)*** — ***THE GOLD STANDARD*** [1][2][3]

This is the ***imaging modality of choice (1st line)*** in patients with urinary stones [1].

**Why NCCT and not contrast CT?**
- Stones are dense mineral concretions — they show up brilliantly on non-contrast CT as bright white (hyperdense) foci against the soft-tissue background
- Adding IV contrast would opacify the renal collecting system with dense contrast material, potentially **obscuring** small stones within the bright contrast column
- NCCT also avoids the risks of contrast (nephrotoxicity, allergic reactions) — particularly important in the acute setting where renal function may already be compromised by obstruction

**What NCCT tells you** [1][2][3]:

| Parameter | Clinical Significance |
|-----------|----------------------|
| ***Size of stone*** | Determines treatment: < 5 mm likely to pass spontaneously; > 10 mm likely needs intervention |
| ***Location of stone*** | Upper, mid, or lower ureter; renal pelvis; calyceal — determines choice of procedure |
| ***Stone density (Hounsfield Units, HU)*** | ***> 1000 HU is considered hard*** [2] (likely calcium oxalate monohydrate or brushite) → ESWL may be less effective; ***< 1000 HU predicts success of ESWL*** [5]. ***Calcium stones: densest. Struvite stones: less dense. Urate stones: least dense*** [3] |
| ***Signs of obstruction*** | ***Ureteral dilatation, collecting system dilatation (hydronephrosis), perinephric stranding*** [1][3] — perinephric stranding occurs because obstructed urine leaks into the retroperitoneal fat surrounding the kidney, causing oedema visible as haziness/"streaking" around the kidney |
| ***Bilateral calcification at corticomedullary junction*** | Suggests ***medullary sponge kidney*** [1] |
| ***Large calculus in renal pelvis*** | Suggests ***struvite stone*** [1] |
| ***Number of stones*** | Affects treatment strategy (single vs multiple) |

**Performance**: ***Sensitivity 97%, Specificity 95%*** [3] — far superior to any other modality. ***May be less reliable for small stones < 2 mm*** [3].

***Even if KUB is negative, it has to be followed up with NCCT as KUB misses 10% of stones*** [1].

> ***Indinavir-induced stones are soft tissue density on CT → cannot be seen on CT → often missed*** [3]. This is the exception to the rule that NCCT catches everything.

<Callout title="NCCT — First and Foremost">
In the exam, if asked "What is the single best investigation for suspected ureteric colic?" → **Low-dose non-contrast CT abdomen and pelvis**. It confirms the stone, shows its size/location/density, demonstrates obstruction, and excludes alternative diagnoses — all without contrast.
</Callout>

##### 2. ***KUB (Plain Radiograph of Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder)*** [1][3][5]

**Role**: ***Usually for screening only*** [3] and as a ***baseline for future follow-up*** [1][3].

**Why still do KUB if NCCT is better?**
- KUB is cheap, quick, and low-radiation
- ***If a stone is confirmed on NCCT and is radio-opaque, a KUB is taken as a baseline*** — future follow-up of stone size/passage can be done with KUB alone instead of repeating NCCT every time (reducing radiation exposure) [1]
- ***Do not perform NCCT every time for follow-up*** [1]

**What KUB shows**:
- ***~90% of stones are radio-opaque*** [3][5] — calcium-containing stones (CaOx, CaPO₄) are the most visible, struvite is moderately visible, cystine is faintly visible
- ***Radiolucent stones (invisible on KUB): urate, xanthine, indinavir*** [3]
- ***Mildly radio-opaque: cystine, struvite*** [3]

**Limitations** [1][3]:
- ***Only detects 29–59% of stones seen on NCCT*** — misses small stones (< 5 mm) and those overlying bony structures
- ***Unable to detect urinary tract obstruction*** [1] (cannot see hydronephrosis)
- Cannot detect radiolucent stones
- Stones can be confused with: ***calcified mesenteric lymph nodes, gallstones, faecolith/appendicolith, phleboliths, ossified tip of 12th rib, nephrocalcinosis, calcified adrenal gland*** [3]

**How to read stones on KUB** — ***trace the ureteric course*** [1][3][5]:
- ***Travels along the medial aspect of the psoas muscle and lies anterior and slightly medial to the tip of the L2–L5 transverse processes*** [1]
- ***Enters the pelvis anterior to the SI joint at the bifurcation of the common iliac vessels*** [1]
- ***Courses anteriorly down the lateral pelvic sidewall***
- ***Turns forward and medially at the level of the ischial spine*** and enters the posterolateral wall of the bladder [1]

##### 3. ***Ultrasound (USG) Kidneys and Bladder*** [1][2][3]

**Role**: ***Acceptable initial screening test, particularly for patients who should avoid radiation including pregnant women and women of childbearing age*** [1]. Also ***preferred in pregnancy or children*** [3].

**What USG can detect**:
- ***Hydronephrosis*** (dilated pelvicalyceal system — indirect sign of obstruction)
- ***Renal stones*** (echogenic foci with posterior acoustic shadowing)
- ***Bladder stones*** (if large enough)
- ***Cortical thinning*** due to chronic obstruction [5]
- ***Prostate size*** measurement (relevant for bladder stones associated with BPH)

**What USG cannot do well**:
- ***Difficulty in defining ureteric lesions*** — only the proximal (PUJ region) and distal (VUJ region) ends of the ureter are visualised; the mid-ureter is obscured by overlying bowel gas [5]
- ***Limited sensitivity — 57% only*** [3]
- ***Does not see ureteric stones but demonstrates obstruction*** [3]
- Cannot determine stone density or composition

> Use USG as the first-line test in **pregnancy** and **paediatrics**, and as a bedside screening tool. If positive for hydronephrosis in a non-pregnant adult, proceed to NCCT for definitive characterisation.

##### 4. ***CT Urogram (CTU)*** [1][3][5]

**What it is**: A multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT scan specifically designed for urinary tract evaluation. ***CTU has largely replaced IVU*** [5].

**Phases** [5]:
- ***Pre-contrast phase***: for gross anatomy — detects stones (same as NCCT)
- ***Corticomedullary (arterial) phase***: for renal perfusion and vasculature
- ***Nephrographic (venous) phase***: for assessment of renal parenchyma (detecting ***renal tumours***)
- ***Excretory (delayed/pyelographic) phase***: for visualisation of the lower urinary tract (detecting ***urothelial tumours***)

**When to use in stone disease** [1][3]:
- ***Evaluating the pelvicalyceal system*** for complex anatomy or recurrent stones
- ***Complex stones or urinary system anatomy*** [3]
- **Not for routine acute loin pain evaluation** [3] — NCCT is sufficient
- ***Reflects renal function while evaluating for gross anatomical abnormalities*** [1]

**Disadvantages**: ***↑↑ radiation, contrast allergy/nephropathy*** [5]

##### 5. ***Dual Energy CT (DECT)*** [2]

**What it is**: A specialised CT technique that acquires images at two different X-ray energy levels simultaneously. Different stone compositions attenuate X-rays differently at different energies, allowing ***differentiation of stone composition*** [2] in vivo without needing to retrieve the stone.

**Clinical utility**: Distinguishing uric acid stones (which can be dissolved medically) from calcium stones (which cannot) — this changes management.

##### 6. ***Intravenous Urogram (IVU)*** [5][10]

**What it is**: IV non-ionic contrast injected → excreted by kidneys → opacifies and visualises urinary system on serial plain films.

***IVU has been largely replaced by CTU*** [5][10], but understanding it is still relevant for exams.

**Preparation** [10]:
- ***Laxatives → ↓ faecal matter (↑ contrast visualisation)***
- ***Fasting ≥ 4h***
- ***Hydration → ↑ distension of urinary collecting system***
- ***Preliminary KUB → may already give diagnosis***
- ***Compression band → distend pelvicalyceal system for evaluation***

**Procedure timing** [10]:
- ***0 min → kidneys highlighted (nephrogram)***
- ***5 min → calyces and renal pelvis***
- ***10 min → ureter and urinary bladder***

**Stone findings on IVU** [5]:
- ***Filling defect, proximal dilatation, ↓ distal passage of contrast***
- ***Hydroureter and hydronephrosis***

**Contraindications** [10]:
- ***Pregnancy (radiation)***
- ***Previous history of serious reactions to contrast media***
- ***Diabetes with renal insufficiency (risk of acute renal failure)***

##### 7. ***Radionuclide Scintigraphy (MAG3 / DTPA Renogram)*** [1]

**What it is**: Injection of radioisotope ***technetium Tc-99m MAG3*** (mercaptoacetyltriglycine) to assess renal excretory function. Provides **both anatomical and functional information**.

**When to use in stone disease** [1]:
- ***Indicated in patients presenting with complications due to prolonged obstruction and requiring measurement of renal function***
- ***Differentiates between obstructive and non-obstructive hydronephrosis*** — by adding a "diuretic stimulus" (furosemide) and watching whether the tracer washes out (non-obstructive) or is retained (obstructive)
- ***Identifies difference in function between two kidneys*** — **differential renal function**

**Critical for surgical planning** [1]:
- ***Kidney with < 15% of total renal function (normal 50% each side) is non-functional and not worth salvaging***
- ***Proceed to PCNL for preserved functional kidney function whereas nephrectomy may be indicated for non-functional kidney***

> A MAG3 renogram is not for diagnosing a stone — it's for deciding what to do about a kidney that's been damaged by a stone.

##### 8. ***MR Urogram (MRU)*** [5]

**Role**: Alternative when CT and IVU are contraindicated — ***pregnancy, contrast allergy, children, renal impairment*** [5].

**Limitations**: ***Less able to detect smaller urothelial lesions and non-obstructing stones*** [1]. ***Image inferior to CT scan (because the kidney is a moving organ)*** [5]. ***Expensive*** [5].

##### 9. ***Retrograde Pyelogram*** [5]

**What it is**: Injection of contrast via a catheter placed in the ureteric orifice during cystoscopy → outlines the ureter and pelvicalyceal system retrogradely.

**When to use**: ***When excretion of contrast cannot be used to outline the urological tract (e.g., poor renal function)*** [5]. Can intervene at the same time (e.g., insertion of JJ stent) [3].

**Invasive**: Requires cystoscopy under anaesthesia.

#### Summary of Imaging Modalities

| Modality | Sensitivity | Key Advantage | Key Limitation | When to Use |
|----------|------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| ***NCCT*** | ***97%*** | Gold standard; size, location, density, obstruction; no contrast needed | Radiation; misses indinavir stones; < 2 mm stones | ***First-line for all suspected ureteric colic*** [1][3] |
| ***KUB*** | 29–59% | Cheap, quick, baseline for F/U | Misses radiolucent + small stones; no obstruction assessment | ***Baseline for follow-up after NCCT confirms stone*** [1][3] |
| ***USG*** | ***57%*** | No radiation; bedside; detects hydronephrosis | Cannot see ureteric stones; limited sensitivity | ***Pregnancy, paediatrics, screening*** [3] |
| ***CTU*** | ~97% | Full anatomical assessment; detects tumours and anomalies | High radiation + contrast risks | ***Complex anatomy, recurrent stones, haematuria workup*** |
| ***DECT*** | Similar to NCCT | Can differentiate stone composition in vivo | Availability, slightly higher radiation | ***When stone composition affects management*** [2] |
| ***IVU*** | ~70% | Functional information; economic | Largely obsolete; contrast risks; misses small lesions | ***Rarely used now*** [5][10] |
| ***MAG3 renogram*** | N/A | Differential renal function | Does not diagnose stones | ***Prolonged obstruction; surgical planning*** [1] |
| ***MRU*** | Variable | No radiation, no contrast | Misses small stones, expensive, inferior resolution | ***Pregnancy, children, contrast allergy*** [5] |

#### B. Laboratory Investigations

##### 1. Urinalysis [1][2][3]

This should be done in **every patient** with suspected urolithiasis. It serves multiple roles:

| Test | What to Look For | Clinical Significance |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|
| ***Dipstick*** | Blood (haem), WBCs, nitrites, pH | Haematuria supports stone diagnosis; ***nitrites + WBCs suggest UTI***; ***pH is important — overly alkaline urine (> 7.5) suggests infection by urease-producing organism, especially in the presence of stones*** [6] |
| ***Microscopy*** | RBCs, WBCs, crystals, organisms | ***Haematuria (gross or microscopic)*** present in ~85% [3]; ***pyuria can be present without infection due to irritation of urothelium*** [3]; crystal morphology may suggest stone type (hexagonal = cystine, coffin-lid = struvite, envelope = CaOx dihydrate, rhomboid = uric acid) |
| ***Urine pH*** | Acidic vs alkaline | ***Acidic (pH < 5.5)***: uric acid, cystine stones. ***Alkaline (pH > 7.5)***: struvite, calcium phosphate stones [6] |
| ***Culture and sensitivity (C/ST)*** | Organisms, antibiotic sensitivity | ***Must rule out UTI before any definitive treatment*** [2]; identifies urease-producing organisms (Proteus, Klebsiella) suggesting struvite stones |

<Callout title="Always Culture Before Operating" type="error">
***MSU C/ST to rule out UTI before any definitive treatment*** [2]. Operating on an infected stone without antibiotics can seed bacteria into the bloodstream → urosepsis. A positive culture mandates antibiotics before/during the procedure.
</Callout>

##### 2. Blood Tests [1][2][3]

| Test | Rationale | Key Findings |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| ***CBC with differentials*** | Detect infection (leukocytosis); anaemia if chronic; baseline before surgery | ***Mild leukocytosis*** may be present even without infection (stress response). Marked leukocytosis with left shift suggests pyelonephritis/urosepsis [1] |
| ***Clotting profile*** | ***Preoperative baseline to look for underlying bleeding diathesis*** [1] — needed before ESWL, PCNL, or URS | Must be checked before any interventional procedure |
| ***RFT (Renal Function Tests)*** | Detect obstructive nephropathy; baseline Cr/eGFR | ***Rarely impaired in unilateral obstruction*** [3] — because the contralateral kidney compensates. ***May be impaired if bilateral staghorn calculi or solitary kidney*** [3] |
| ***Serum calcium and phosphate*** | Screen for ***primary hyperparathyroidism*** (the most important metabolic cause) [3][4]; also sarcoidosis, malignancy | ↑ Ca²⁺ + ↓/normal PO₄³⁻ + ↑ PTH = primary hyperPTH. Check ***albumin-corrected calcium*** to avoid factitious hypercalcaemia [4] |
| ***Serum uric acid (urate)*** | Screen for ***hyperuricaemia*** — gout, myeloproliferative disease, high purine diet | ↑ Urate supports uric acid stone diagnosis; also a risk factor for calcium stones (uric acid crystals act as a nidus) |
| ***PTH*** | If calcium is elevated — distinguish PTH-dependent from PTH-independent hypercalcaemia [4] | ↑ or inappropriately normal PTH with ↑ Ca = primary hyperPTH |
| ***Serum bicarbonate*** | Screen for ***distal RTA (Type 1)*** — chronic metabolic acidosis → ↓ citrate → calcium phosphate stones [3] | Low bicarbonate with hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis + alkaline urine pH (inability to acidify) = distal RTA |
| ***CRP*** | Acute-phase reactant for infection/inflammation | Elevated in pyelonephritis/urosepsis |

##### 3. Stone Composition Analysis [3]

When a stone is **retrieved** (after spontaneous passage, or during surgical procedure), it should **always be sent for composition analysis**:

- ***Methods: Infrared spectroscopy (IRS) or X-ray diffraction (XRD)*** [3]
- ***Obtain stone by stone retrieval procedure or by patient when they pass stones*** [3]

**Clinical relevance of stone composition** [3]:
- ***Calcium oxalate monohydrate / brushite are hard stones and may not be fragmented as easily with ESWL***
- ***Uric acid stone indicates acidic urine and alkalinisation of urine may be helpful***
- ***May suggest underlying conditions*** — e.g., Type 1 RTA / hyperPTH in calcium phosphate stones; upper UTI in struvite stones

> Always instruct patients to strain their urine through a sieve/filter after an episode of renal colic. If they catch a stone, it must be sent to the laboratory. This small step can change the entire management plan.

##### 4. Metabolic Evaluation — ***Follow-Up Assessment for Underlying Risk Factors (Secondary Prevention)*** [3]

This is done **after the acute episode is managed**, particularly in:
- First-time stone formers with risk factors
- **All recurrent stone formers**
- Children/young adults with stones
- Patients with specific stone types (cystine, uric acid, struvite)

| Investigation | What It Assesses | Key Findings |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ***Serum calcium*** | ***Primary hyperparathyroidism*** (most important medical cause) [3] | ↑ Ca → check PTH → if ↑/inappropriately normal → primary hyperPTH |
| ***Serum bicarbonate*** | ***Distal RTA*** [3] | ↓ HCO₃⁻ + normal anion gap metabolic acidosis + alkaline urine → Type 1 RTA |
| ***Urine pH*** | Guides stone type prediction | ***↑ pH in phosphate and struvite stones; ↓ pH in uric acid stones*** [3] |
| ***Urine crystals*** | Morphological clue to stone type | Oxalate, phosphate, uric acid, cystine (hexagonal — pathognomonic) |
| ***24-hour urine collection*** | Comprehensive metabolic profile | ***Calcium, uric acid, citrate, oxalate, sodium, potassium, creatinine excretion, volume, pH, specific gravity*** [3]. This is the cornerstone of secondary prevention — identifies which metabolic abnormality to target |

**24-Hour Urine — Key Abnormalities and Their Implications**:

| Abnormality | Target Value | Implication |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hypercalciuria | > 7.5 mmol/day (M) or > 6.25 mmol/day (F) | Idiopathic (most common), hyperPTH, sarcoidosis, RTA |
| Hyperoxaluria | > 0.5 mmol/day | Dietary (common), enteric (IBD, bariatric surgery), primary (rare genetic) |
| Hyperuricosuria | > 4.8 mmol/day (M) or > 4.5 mmol/day (F) | High purine diet, gout, myeloproliferative disease |
| Hypocitraturia | < 1.7 mmol/day | Metabolic acidosis (RTA, chronic diarrhoea), high animal protein diet, idiopathic |
| Low urine volume | < 2 L/day | Inadequate fluid intake — the most modifiable risk factor |
| High urine sodium | > 200 mmol/day | High dietary sodium → competes with Ca for tubular reabsorption → hypercalciuria |
| Cystinuria | > 1.3 mmol/day | Autosomal recessive cystinuria — COLA amino acids |

---

#### C. Special Situations

##### When the Patient Has Gross Haematuria (Not Just Stone Workup)

***Cystoscopy should be done in ALL patients with gross non-glomerular haematuria, even if a stone is found on KUB*** [5]. Why? ***Because the presence of stones does not rule out concomitant malignancy*** [5]. A bladder transitional cell carcinoma can coexist with a ureteric stone, and cystoscopy is the only way to directly visualise the bladder mucosa for tumours as small as 1 mm [5].

> ***CTU + cystoscopy is mandatory*** for the complete haematuria workup [5]. The standard urological workup for haematuria = **cystoscopy + upper tract imaging**.

##### When Renal Function is Impaired

If renal function is compromised (suspect bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney):
- ***USG first*** to detect hydronephrosis → if bilateral → urgent decompression
- ***Radioisotope scintigraphy (MAG3)*** for differential renal function → guides surgical planning [1]

### Putting It All Together — Investigation Checklist for Acute Urolithiasis

| Category | Investigation | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Imaging (acute)** | ***Low-dose NCCT abdomen + pelvis*** | Confirm stone; size, location, density, obstruction |
| **Imaging (baseline)** | ***KUB (if stone radio-opaque)*** | Baseline for future follow-up without repeating CT |
| **Imaging (special)** | ***USG*** (if pregnant/child/screening) | Detect hydronephrosis; limited stone detection |
| **Urine** | ***Dipstick + microscopy*** | Haematuria, pyuria, pH |
| **Urine** | ***MSU C/ST*** | ***Rule out UTI before definitive treatment*** |
| **Blood** | ***CBC, CRP*** | Infection, baseline |
| **Blood** | ***Clotting profile*** | Pre-procedural |
| **Blood** | ***RFT*** | Renal function; bilateral obstruction |
| **Blood** | ***Serum calcium, phosphate*** | Hyperparathyroidism screening |
| **Blood** | ***Serum urate*** | Hyperuricaemia screening |
| **Stone** | ***Composition analysis (IR spectroscopy / XRD)*** | Determines stone type → guides prevention |
| **Follow-up** | ***24-hour urine collection*** | Metabolic evaluation for secondary prevention |
| **Special** | ***MAG3 renogram*** | Differential renal function if prolonged obstruction |
| **Special** | ***DECT*** | In vivo stone composition differentiation |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Gold standard imaging**: Low-dose NCCT abdomen + pelvis (Sensitivity 97%, Specificity 95%). No contrast needed — stones are inherently hyperdense.

**KUB role**: NOT for diagnosis — for follow-up baseline. 90% of stones are radio-opaque. Radiolucent stones (uric acid, xanthine, indinavir) are invisible on KUB.

**USG role**: First-line in pregnancy/children. Limited sensitivity (57%). Good for hydronephrosis, poor for ureteric stones.

**Urine pH is diagnostic gold**: pH > 7.5 with stones → think struvite (urease-producing infection). pH < 5.5 → think uric acid.

**Always send MSU C/ST** before any intervention — operating on infected stones without antibiotics → urosepsis.

**Always send the stone for composition analysis** (IR spectroscopy or XRD) — it determines secondary prevention strategy.

**MAG3 renogram** for differential renal function: kidney < 15% function → not worth salvaging → consider nephrectomy.

**24-hour urine** is the cornerstone of metabolic evaluation: calcium, oxalate, urate, citrate, sodium, volume, pH.

**Screen for primary hyperPTH** (serum Ca + PTH) in every calcium stone former — it is the most important treatable medical cause.
