## Complications of Hemorrhoids

Complications of hemorrhoids fall into two categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** — what happens when hemorrhoids are left untreated or progress
2. **Complications of treatment** — what happens after office-based procedures or surgery

Both are important for exams. Let's work through each from first principles.

---

### A. Complications of Hemorrhoidal Disease

The senior notes list the following complications [3]:

> ***Strangulation and thrombosis, gangrene, ulceration, fibrosis, portal pyaemia***

Let me explain each one mechanistically, because understanding the "why" makes these easy to remember.

---

#### 1. Thrombosis

- **What happens:** Venous stasis within the engorged hemorrhoidal plexus → blood pools and clots → **thrombus forms within the hemorrhoidal vascular cushion**.
- **Why it happens:** The sluggish flow in the dilated, congested AV sinusoids creates the conditions of Virchow's triad (stasis, endothelial injury from chronic trauma, hypercoagulability is not typically a factor but the other two are sufficient). Sphincter spasm from the prolapsed tissue further impedes venous drainage, worsening the stasis.
- **Clinical presentation:** Acute onset of severe perianal pain + swollen, tense, bluish mass. For **external hemorrhoids**: the classic ***painful bluish perianal mass*** [2]. For **internal hemorrhoids**: thrombosis usually occurs in the context of prolapse (Grade III/IV) where the tissue becomes trapped outside.
- **Recall from clinical features:** ***Pain occurs only when complications are present (thrombosis, prolapse)*** [1]. Thrombosis is the most common reason uncomplicated hemorrhoids become painful.
- **Natural history of thrombosed external hemorrhoids:** The "***5-day, painful, self-curing lesion***" [3] — peak pain in the first 48–72 hours, then the clot gradually organizes and is reabsorbed. The residual stretched skin becomes a **skin tag** (***forms skin tag after 48 hours*** [2]).

---

#### 2. Strangulation

- **What happens:** A prolapsed internal hemorrhoid (typically Grade III or IV) protrudes through the anal canal → the anal sphincter contracts around the base of the prolapsed tissue → venous outflow is completely obstructed while arterial inflow initially continues → the tissue becomes **massively engorged, oedematous, and trapped** (incarcerated).
- **Why it happens:** The sphincter acts like a tourniquet. Initially, arterial blood still enters (arteries have higher pressure than the constrictive force of the sphincter), but venous return is blocked (veins have lower pressure). This creates a vicious cycle: arterial inflow without venous outflow → progressive engorgement → more oedema → even more pressure → eventually arterial supply is also compromised.
- **Clinical presentation:** Acutely painful, swollen, tense, irreducible hemorrhoidal mass. The tissue appears dark purple or dusky. Patient is in significant distress with marked sphincter spasm.
- **This is a surgical emergency** — if not reduced, strangulation progresses to gangrene (see below).

<Callout title="Strangulation vs. Thrombosis">
These two complications are related but distinct. **Thrombosis** = clot within the venous plexus (can occur with or without prolapse). **Strangulation** = mechanical trapping of prolapsed tissue by the sphincter, cutting off blood supply. Strangulation often leads to secondary thrombosis, and the two frequently coexist. Both cause acute pain, but strangulation is the more dangerous of the two because it can lead to gangrene.
</Callout>

#### 3. Gangrene

- **What happens:** Prolonged strangulation → complete arterial ischaemia → **tissue necrosis (gangrene)** of the prolapsed hemorrhoidal tissue.
- **Why it happens:** The progression is: prolapse → strangulation (venous obstruction) → continued arterial inflow → massive engorgement → eventually arterial inflow also obstructed → ischaemia → infarction → gangrene. Superimposed bacterial infection accelerates the necrotic process.
- **Clinical presentation:** The prolapsed hemorrhoidal mass becomes **black, necrotic, foul-smelling**, and extremely painful. There may be surrounding cellulitis and systemic signs of sepsis (fever, tachycardia).
- **Management:** This is an emergency. Requires **urgent surgical hemorrhoidectomy** — specifically the ***Open (Milligan-Morgan)*** technique is ***preferred for acute gangrenous haemorrhoids*** because leaving the wound open ***prevents further tissue oedema and necrosis*** [2] (closing a wound over necrotic, infected tissue would trap the infection and worsen the situation).

---

#### 4. Ulceration

- **What happens:** The mucosal surface of a prolapsed hemorrhoid is exposed to the external environment and subjected to repeated mechanical trauma (clothing friction, sitting, defecation) → the fragile columnar mucosa **ulcerates**.
- **Why it happens:** Columnar epithelium (above the dentate line) is not designed to withstand the dry, abrasive environment outside the anal canal. Unlike squamous epithelium (which is tough and stratified), columnar epithelium is thin and delicate. When chronically prolapsed, it becomes traumatized and eroded.
- **Clinical significance:** Ulcerated hemorrhoids bleed more readily and are vulnerable to secondary infection. The ulceration can also cause pain (exposed submucosa is sensitive) and mucus discharge.

---

#### 5. Fibrosis

- **What happens:** Chronic, repeated episodes of thrombosis, inflammation, and ulceration → **fibrotic scarring** replaces the normal vascular and connective tissue of the hemorrhoidal cushion.
- **Why it happens:** This is the normal wound-healing response to chronic injury — inflammation → granulation tissue → fibrosis. The hemorrhoidal cushion becomes firm and non-compressible rather than soft and vascular.
- **Clinical significance:** Fibrosed hemorrhoids are firm, whitish, and do not respond well to conservative measures or office-based procedures (rubber band ligation is less effective on fibrotic tissue). ***Fibrosed hemorrhoids*** are listed as a specific ***indication for surgical treatment*** [3]. The fibrotic tissue also predisposes to chronic skin tags.

---

#### 6. Portal Pyaemia

- **What happens:** Bacterial infection of the hemorrhoidal tissue (e.g., from ulceration or post-procedural sepsis) → bacteria enter the **superior rectal veins** → ascend via the **inferior mesenteric vein** → reach the **portal vein** → seed the **liver** → **portal pyaemia** (septic thrombophlebitis of the portal venous system) → potentially **liver abscess**.
- **Why it happens:** Recall from the anatomy section that internal hemorrhoids drain via the ***superior rectal veins → portal venous system*** [3]. This direct connection between the anal canal and the portal system means that any septic process in the hemorrhoidal tissue can, in theory, seed the liver via the portal blood.
- **Clinical significance:** This is extremely rare but potentially fatal. Presents with high spiking fevers, rigors, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. The liver abscess(es) are typically multiple. Requires aggressive IV antibiotics and possibly percutaneous drainage.
- "Pyaemia" = "pyo" (pus) + "haemia" (blood) — literally pus in the blood. Portal pyaemia specifically means septic emboli travelling through the portal venous system.

<Callout title="Why Portal Pyaemia Is the Most Feared Complication">
Portal pyaemia is the rarest but most dangerous complication of hemorrhoids. It connects the seemingly benign anorectal condition to life-threatening hepatic sepsis. The anatomical basis is the **portal venous drainage of internal hemorrhoids**. This is why maintaining good perianal hygiene and treating infection promptly is important, especially in immunocompromised patients.
</Callout>

#### 7. Iron Deficiency Anaemia (from Chronic Bleeding)

Although not listed in the classic "complications" list, this is clinically important:

- **What happens:** Chronic, recurrent hemorrhoidal bleeding (even if small volume per episode) → cumulative blood loss over months to years → depletion of iron stores → iron deficiency anaemia.
- **Clinical significance:** ***Hemorrhoidal bleeding leading to anaemia*** is a specific ***indication for surgical treatment*** [3]. Any patient with hemorrhoids and anaemia should also have a colonoscopy to exclude a coexisting proximal colonic malignancy as the cause of the anaemia — hemorrhoids alone uncommonly cause significant anaemia.

### B. Complications of Hemorrhoid Treatment

#### B1. Complications of Rubber Band Ligation

| Complication | Mechanism | Notes |
|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Pain*** | Band placed too close to or below the dentate line → somatic innervation activated. Also, tissue ischaemia from the band causes inflammatory mediator release | ***Most frequent complication (~8%)*** [4]. Usually self-limiting. If severe, the band should be removed |
| ***Delayed bleeding*** | ***7–10 days post-banding due to sloughing of ligated haemorrhoids*** [2] — the necrotic tissue falls off, leaving an ulcer that may bleed before it heals with fibrosis | Usually minor, but can be significant in patients on anticoagulants (this is why ***RBL is contraindicated in coagulopathy, anticoagulant use, portal hypertension*** [4]) |
| ***Post-banding sepsis*** [2] | Bacterial invasion through the necrotic tissue / ulcer bed → pelvic cellulitis → potentially necrotizing fasciitis | Rare but potentially fatal. Presents with fever, severe perineal pain, and urinary retention 3–7 days post-procedure. Requires urgent IV antibiotics ± surgical debridement |
| **Urinary retention** [4] | Reflex inhibition of micturition from perianal pain and anal sphincter spasm (visceral-somatic reflex) | Self-limiting; may require temporary catheterisation |
| **Hemorrhoidal thrombosis** [4] | Venous congestion in adjacent, non-banded hemorrhoidal tissue due to local oedema and altered haemodynamics | May cause paradoxical worsening of symptoms after RBL |

---

#### B2. Complications of Hemorrhoidectomy

The lecture slide lists the complications of hemorrhoidectomy as:

> ***Bleeding, urine retention, pain, faecal impaction, infection, anal tags, anal stenosis, incontinence*** [1]

Let me explain each:

| Complication | Timing | Mechanism | Management |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| ***Pain*** [1][2] | Early | ***~100% incidence due to IAS spasm*** [2]. The surgical wound in the highly innervated perianal area triggers reflex sphincter spasm, which further compresses the wound and sensitised nerve endings | Analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids if needed), warm sitz baths, topical GTN or nifedipine (to relax IAS and reduce spasm). Metronidazole has been shown to reduce post-hemorrhoidectomy pain |
| ***Urinary retention*** [1][2] | Early | ***Causes: pain and anal spasm, fluid overload, rectal packing, drugs (narcotics, anticholinergics), pre-existing outflow tract obstruction*** [2]. The perineal pain triggers a visceral-somatic reflex that inhibits detrusor contraction | ***Leave urinary catheter in situ for 24 hours*** [2]. Limit IV fluids perioperatively. Minimise opioid use. Early mobilisation |
| ***Bleeding (reactionary)*** [1] | Early ( < 24h) | From a slipped ligature or inadequate intraoperative haemostasis. The operative field is highly vascular (AV sinusoidal tissue) | Return to theatre for examination under anaesthesia and re-ligation/cautery if significant |
| ***Faecal impaction*** [1] | Early | Post-operative pain causes patients to avoid defecation → progressive accumulation and hardening of stool in the rectum | Pre-operative and post-operative stool softeners. Encourage early defecation. Enema if needed |
| ***Infection*** [1] | Early–Intermediate | Wound contamination by faecal flora is inevitable in the perianal region. Usually minor wound infection | Antibiotics if spreading cellulitis. Sitz baths for wound care. Rarely progresses to pelvic sepsis |
| ***Secondary haemorrhage*** [3] | Late (7–14 days) | Infection of the wound bed → erosion of a blood vessel by the infective/inflammatory process → delayed bleeding | May require return to theatre. Antibiotics |
| ***Anal tags*** [1] | Late | Excess mucosal or skin tissue left behind during surgery → heals as a redundant tag, or post-inflammatory oedema resolves leaving a skin fold | Usually asymptomatic. Can be excised if symptomatic |
| ***Anal stenosis*** [1][2] | Late | ***Excessive tissue removal → circumferential scarring → narrowing of the anal canal*** [2]. This is exactly why the ***3-leaf clover excision pattern is used — avoid circumferential excision, which is prone to stenosis*** [2] | Prevention is key (adequate mucocutaneous bridges). Treatment: digital dilatation, anoplasty in severe cases |
| ***Faecal incontinence*** [1][2] | Late | ***Injury to the anal sphincter (IAS or EAS) during excision*** [2]. Can be from direct surgical trauma or from excessive internal sphincterotomy performed concomitantly | Prevention: careful surgical technique, avoid excessive sphincter manipulation. Managed with pelvic floor exercises, biofeedback, or surgical repair if severe |
| ***Anal fissure*** [2] | Late | Hard stool passing through the healing wound → mechanical tearing of the granulating/epithelialising wound bed | Prevention: stool softeners, adequate fibre. Managed as per standard fissure treatment if symptomatic |

---

#### B3. Complications of Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy

The lecture slide is specific about this:

> ***"Complications can be serious (rectal perforation, severe pelvic sepsis, rectovaginal fistula). More recurrence than conventional haemorrhoidectomy"*** [1]

| Complication | Mechanism |
|:--|:--|
| ***Rectal perforation*** [1][3] | The circular stapler fires through all layers of the rectal wall rather than just mucosa/submucosa → full-thickness perforation → peritonitis. This is a catastrophic complication requiring emergency laparotomy |
| ***Severe pelvic sepsis*** [1][3] | Full-thickness rectal injury allows faecal contamination of the pelvic tissues → spreading pelvic cellulitis and abscess formation → life-threatening sepsis |
| ***Rectovaginal fistula*** [1][3] | In female patients, the posterior vaginal wall is closely applied to the anterior rectal wall. The stapler may inadvertently incorporate vaginal tissue → abnormal communication between rectum and vagina → passage of stool/gas per vaginum |
| ***Higher recurrence rate*** [1][2][3] | Hemorrhoidal tissue is not excised — merely repositioned and devascularised. The supportive tissue may re-degenerate and the blood supply may re-establish via collateral vessels → recurrence of prolapse and symptoms |

<Callout title="Why Stapled Hemorrhoidopexy Is Less Favoured Now" type="error">
The stapled approach was initially popular due to ***less pain, quicker recovery, and higher patient satisfaction*** [1]. However, the ***higher recurrence rate*** and the risk of ***rare but catastrophic complications (rectal perforation, pelvic sepsis, rectovaginal fistula)*** [1] have made it ***less favoured now*** in many centres [2]. Conventional hemorrhoidectomy remains the gold standard for definitive treatment. Know both the advantages and disadvantages for exams.

### C. Summary: Natural History of Untreated Hemorrhoids

Understanding the complications allows you to trace the natural history of progressive untreated hemorrhoidal disease:

```
Grade I (bleeds) → Grade II (prolapse, spontaneous reduction) → Grade III (manual reduction)
→ Grade IV (irreducible) → Strangulation → Thrombosis → Gangrene
                                                          ↘ Ulceration → Chronic bleeding → Anaemia
                                                          ↘ Fibrosis → Skin tags
                                                          ↘ Secondary infection → Portal pyaemia (rare)
```

This progression is driven by the same underlying mechanism throughout: **progressive degeneration of fibroelastic support → worsening prolapse → increasing venous congestion → increasing vulnerability to mechanical trauma, thrombosis, and ischaemia**.

|:--|:--|:--|
| **Thrombosis** | Disease | Venous stasis in engorged plexus → clot formation |

| **Gangrene** | Disease | Prolonged strangulation → arterial ischaemia → tissue necrosis |
| **Ulceration** | Disease | Exposed columnar mucosa traumatised by external environment |
| **Fibrosis** | Disease | Chronic inflammation/thrombosis → scarring replacing normal tissue |
| **Portal pyaemia** | Disease | Infection → bacteria enter superior rectal veins → portal system → liver |
| **Iron deficiency anaemia** | Disease | Chronic blood loss → iron depletion |
| ***Pain*** | Post-op | IAS spasm; wound in somatically-innervated perianal area |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of hemorrhoidal disease (5 classic + anaemia):**
1. **Strangulation and thrombosis** — sphincter traps prolapsed tissue; venous stasis → clot
2. **Gangrene** — prolonged strangulation → arterial ischaemia → necrosis (emergency — open Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy)
3. **Ulceration** — exposed columnar mucosa traumatised externally
4. **Fibrosis** — chronic inflammation → scarring (indication for surgery)
5. **Portal pyaemia** — infection via superior rectal veins → portal system → liver abscess (rarest, most dangerous)
6. Iron deficiency anaemia — chronic blood loss (indication for surgery)

**Complications of hemorrhoidectomy (from lecture slides):**
***Bleeding, urine retention, pain, faecal impaction, infection, anal tags, anal stenosis, incontinence***

**Complications of stapled hemorrhoidopexy (must know for exams):**
***Rectal perforation, severe pelvic sepsis, rectovaginal fistula, higher recurrence rate*** — these are the reason it is ***less favoured now***

**Key prevention points:**
- Anal stenosis prevented by 3-leaf clover excision pattern (mucocutaneous bridges)
- Urinary retention managed by catheter for 24 hours, limiting IV fluids, minimising opioids
- Post-banding sepsis is rare but fatal — counsel patients to return if fever, severe pain, or urinary symptoms after RBL
