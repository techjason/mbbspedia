## Complications of Hyperthyroidism

Complications of hyperthyroidism fall into two broad categories: (A) complications of the **disease itself** (untreated or poorly controlled thyrotoxicosis), and (B) complications of **treatment** (antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, surgery). Both are equally important for exams and clinical practice.

---

## A. Complications of Untreated / Poorly Controlled Hyperthyroidism

### 1. Cardiovascular Complications

The heart is the organ most vulnerable to thyroid hormone excess. This makes sense from first principles: T3 upregulates β1-adrenergic receptors on cardiomyocytes, increases heart rate, increases contractility, and decreases systemic vascular resistance. Over time, this sustained hyperdynamic state exhausts the myocardium.

#### a. Atrial Fibrillation (AF)

- Occurs in **10–15%** of thyrotoxic patients; much higher (~25–30%) in the elderly.
- **Why?** T3 increases atrial ectopic activity and shortens the atrial refractory period → promotes re-entrant circuits → AF. The atrial myocytes are particularly sensitive to thyroid hormone.
- **Clinical significance**: AF in thyrotoxicosis carries a thromboembolic stroke risk — anticoagulation should be considered (CHA₂DS₂-VASc scoring still applies).
- **Key point**: AF may be the **presenting feature** of hyperthyroidism, especially in the elderly ("apathetic thyrotoxicosis"). ***Always check TFTs in new-onset AF.***
- AF often reverts to sinus rhythm spontaneously once euthyroidism is restored (within weeks to months). If it doesn't revert within 4–6 months of euthyroidism, consider cardioversion.

#### b. High-Output Heart Failure

- ***Deterioration of CVS disease by thyrotoxicosis — increased workload of the heart and worsens ischaemic symptoms — angina, arrhythmias, cardiac failure*** [2].
- **Mechanism**: Chronic ↑ cardiac output (↑ HR × ↑ stroke volume) + ↓ SVR → initially compensated → eventually myocardial exhaustion + direct T3-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis + tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy → **decompensated biventricular heart failure**.
- Presents with dyspnoea, peripheral oedema, elevated JVP, hepatomegaly.
- Particularly dangerous in patients with **pre-existing ischaemic heart disease** — the increased myocardial oxygen demand can precipitate angina or myocardial infarction.

#### c. Thyrotoxic Cardiomyopathy

- A form of dilated cardiomyopathy caused by prolonged thyrotoxicosis.
- Potentially **reversible** if thyrotoxicosis is treated early.
- If not treated, progresses to irreversible fibrosis and permanent heart failure.

### 2. Thyroid Storm (Thyrotoxic Crisis)

***Thyroid storm develops in patients with longstanding untreated hyperthyroidism which is precipitated by an acute event such as surgery, trauma, or infection*** [2].

- **Pathophysiology**: ***Rapid increase in serum thyroid hormone levels → increased response to sympathetic inputs from catecholamines (adrenaline/noradrenaline) by permissive effect → cardiovascular symptoms including hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension, followed by heart failure with hypotension and arrhythmia*** [2].
- **Mortality**: 10–30% even with treatment. This is a true endocrine emergency.
- **Common precipitants**: Thyroid/non-thyroid surgery, infection, trauma, iodine contrast, RAI therapy, non-compliance with ATDs, DKA, labour/delivery.
- **Clinical features**: Fever > 40°C, severe tachycardia (often > 140 bpm), agitation/delirium/psychosis, seizures, nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea, jaundice (hepatic dysfunction), and eventually cardiovascular collapse.

> The management of thyroid storm was covered in detail in the Management section: **PTU + Propranolol + Hydrocortisone → then Iodide after 1 hour**. ***Paracetamol (NOT salicylate) for hyperpyrexia*** [2].

### 3. Osteoporosis and Fractures

- **Mechanism**: T3 stimulates both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, but the net effect is **increased bone resorption** (osteoclastic activity predominates). This leads to negative calcium balance, reduced bone mineral density, and osteoporosis.
- Particularly concerning in **postmenopausal women** and in **subclinical hyperthyroidism** (even mildly suppressed TSH increases fracture risk).
- Can present with mild hypercalcaemia (from bone resorption) and hypercalciuria.
- **Prevention**: Treat the underlying thyrotoxicosis; DEXA scan for patients at risk; calcium/vitamin D supplementation.

### 4. Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis

- Predominantly affects **Asian males** (very HK-relevant).
- Mechanism: T3 upregulates Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase → drives K⁺ intracellularly → acute hypokalaemia → muscle membrane hyperpolarisation → flaccid paralysis.
- Triggered by carbohydrate-rich meals (insulin surge further drives K⁺ into cells), exercise, stress, alcohol.
- Presents as sudden-onset **bilateral lower limb weakness** progressing to all four limbs. Reflexes reduced/absent. Respiratory muscles usually spared.
- **ECG**: U waves, prolonged QT, flattened T waves (hypokalaemia).
- **Treatment**: Cautious K⁺ replacement (risk of rebound hyperkalaemia as K⁺ shifts back out once thyrotoxicosis is treated); non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol — reduces Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity); definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism.
- **Resolves completely** once euthyroidism is achieved. Does not recur once thyrotoxicosis is controlled.

### 5. Ophthalmopathy (Graves'-Specific)

***Graves' ophthalmopathy*** is graded by the ***NO SPECS scoring system*** [2]:

| ***Grade*** | ***Category*** | ***Features*** | ***Pathophysiological Basis*** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***0*** | ***No signs and symptoms*** | — | — |
| ***1*** | ***Only signs, no symptoms*** | ***Lid retraction and lid lag*** | ***Result of excess sympathetic activity — not specific to Graves'*** [2]; sustained contraction of Müller's muscle |
| ***2*** | ***Soft tissue involvement*** | ***Periorbital oedema*** | ***T-cells and autoantibodies reactive to extraocular muscles and retro-orbital tissues → inflammation → deposition of collagen and glycosaminoglycan in muscles → swelling*** [2] |
| ***3*** | ***Proptosis*** | ***Exophthalmos*** | Expansion of retro-orbital fat and muscle → pushes globe forward. ***Best detected by visualising sclera between lower border of iris and lower eyelid*** [2] |
| ***4*** | ***Extraocular muscle involvement*** | ***Diplopia / Ophthalmoplegia*** | Fibrotic, swollen muscles become restrictive. ***Inferior rectus affected first, then goes anticlockwise (IR → MR → SR → LR)*** [2] |
| ***5*** | ***Corneal involvement*** | ***Corneal ulceration, scleral injection, chemosis, conjunctivitis*** | Incomplete lid closure from proptosis → exposure keratopathy → corneal drying and ulceration |
| ***6*** | ***Sight loss*** | ***Papilloedema, peripheral field defects, blindness*** | ***Compression of CN II*** at the orbital apex by swollen muscles [2] |

***Risk factors for Graves' ophthalmopathy*** [2]:
- ***Smoking*** (single most important modifiable risk factor)
- ***High anti-TSH (TRAb) level*** [2]
- RAI therapy (can worsen eye disease — mitigate with steroid cover)
- Unstable thyroid status (both hyper- and hypothyroidism can worsen eyes)

**Management of ophthalmopathy**:
- **Mild/inactive**: Lubricating eye drops, sunglasses, head elevation at night, smoking cessation.
- **Moderate-to-severe/active (high CAS score)**: IV methylprednisolone pulse therapy (first-line), orbital radiotherapy, or teprotumumab (anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody — newer agent, increasingly used).
- **Sight-threatening (optic neuropathy)**: Emergency — urgent IV methylprednisolone; if no response → orbital decompression surgery.
- **Rehabilitative (stable, inactive disease)**: Orbital decompression surgery (for proptosis), strabismus surgery (for diplopia), eyelid surgery (for retraction).

### 6. Graves' Dermopathy (Pretibial Myxoedema)

- Occurs in < 5% of Graves' patients. Almost always associated with ophthalmopathy.
- Raised, non-pitting, waxy "peau d'orange" plaques over pretibial area.
- Mechanism: TRAb stimulates fibroblasts expressing TSH receptors in the skin → glycosaminoglycan deposition.
- Usually mild and self-limiting. Treatment: topical corticosteroids under occlusive dressing.

### 7. Thyroid Acropachy

- Rarest manifestation (< 1%).
- Clubbing of fingers and toes + periosteal new bone formation (resembles hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy).
- Almost always seen with ophthalmopathy AND dermopathy.
- No specific treatment; improves with control of thyrotoxicosis.

### 8. Neuropsychiatric Complications

- Anxiety, emotional lability, insomnia, difficulty concentrating.
- In severe cases: **thyrotoxic psychosis** — paranoia, hallucinations, agitation.
- Reversible with treatment of underlying thyrotoxicosis.

### 9. Reproductive Complications

- **Women**: Oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, subfertility, increased miscarriage risk. In pregnancy: pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal thyrotoxicosis (if TRAb crosses placenta).
- **Men**: Gynecomastia (↑ SHBG → relative estrogen excess), erectile dysfunction, reduced libido, oligospermia.

### 10. Hepatic Complications

- Thyrotoxicosis can cause deranged LFTs: elevated ALP (from bone), mildly elevated transaminases (direct T3 effect on hepatocytes or hepatic congestion from high-output HF).
- In severe thyrotoxicosis / thyroid storm: hepatocellular injury, jaundice — an ominous prognostic sign.

## B. Complications of Treatment

### 1. Complications of Antithyroid Drugs (Thionamides)

| Complication | Frequency | Mechanism / Details | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Skin rash / urticaria / pruritus*** | ***~5%*** | ***Allergic reaction — triggers histamine release*** [2] | ***Treated by antihistamine*** [2]. If mild, may continue ATD with antihistamine cover. If severe, switch drug or consider alternative treatment |
| ***Fever*** | Uncommon | Drug hypersensitivity | Differentiate from agranulocytosis-related fever — check FBC urgently |
| ***Arthritis / arthralgia*** | Uncommon | Immune-mediated | Switch to alternative ATD or definitive treatment |
| ***Agranulocytosis*** | ***0.1–0.5%*** | ***Occurs within the first 2–3 months of treatment*** [2]. Idiosyncratic (PTU) or dose-related (methimazole/carbimazole at high doses). Immune-mediated destruction of neutrophil precursors | **STOP drug immediately**. Urgent FBC. Broad-spectrum antibiotics if febrile. G-CSF may be used. Never rechallenge with the same drug. ~50% cross-react with the other thionamide — safest to switch to RAI or surgery |
| ***Hepatotoxicity*** | Rare | PTU: **hepatocellular necrosis** (can be fulminant liver failure — this is why PTU is reserved for 1st trimester only). Carbimazole/methimazole: **cholestatic** pattern (usually milder and reversible) | Stop drug. Supportive. LFT monitoring. Consider RAI or surgery |
| ANCA-positive vasculitis | Very rare | Mostly with PTU — anti-MPO antibodies | Stop PTU permanently |

<Callout title="Patient Education Point" type="error">
Every patient started on thionamides MUST be educated: **"If you develop a sore throat, fever, or mouth ulcers, STOP the medication immediately and go to A&E for an urgent blood test."** Agranulocytosis can be fatal if not recognised early (severe sepsis in a neutropenic patient). This is a common exam question — "What would you counsel a patient starting carbimazole?"
</Callout>

### 2. Complications of Radioactive Iodine (I-131)

| Complication | Frequency | Mechanism / Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Hypothyroidism*** | Very common | ***Transient: 3.5–28%. Permanent: 10–15% in the first 2 years, then 3% per year*** [2]. ***Due to late effects of radiation and lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of thyroid tissue*** [2]. ***Requires lifelong T4 replacement*** [2] |
| Radiation thyroiditis | ~10% | Transient inflammation 1–2 weeks post-RAI → release of stored hormone → temporary worsening of thyrotoxicosis. Self-limiting. Manage with beta-blockers, NSAIDs |
| Worsening Graves' ophthalmopathy | Moderate risk | Release of thyroid antigens → immune flare → orbital inflammation. Mitigate with steroid prophylaxis (especially if eye disease is active/moderate) |
| Sialadenitis (salivary gland inflammation) | ~10–30% | Salivary glands also express NIS → take up I-131 → radiation damage → pain, swelling, dry mouth. Sour candy/lemon juice stimulates salivary flow to help clear isotope |
| Transient neck pain/swelling | Common | Local radiation effect on thyroid. Self-limiting |
| Theoretical concerns | Very rare | ***NO effect on fertility. NO effect on congenital malformations. NO increased cancer risk of offspring*** [2]. However, contraception required for ≥ 6 months post-RAI |

### 3. ***Complications of Thyroidectomy*** [2][7]

This is one of the highest-yield topics for surgical examinations. Complications are classified by timing:

#### ***Immediate (Intraoperative)*** [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Intraoperative bleeding*** | Thyroid is one of the most vascular organs per gram of tissue. Branches of superior and inferior thyroid arteries at risk | Bleeding obscures surgical field | Meticulous haemostasis, bipolar diathermy, vessel ligation. Pre-op Lugol's iodine reduces vascularity |
| ***Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury*** | ***RLN supplies all intrinsic muscles of the larynx except cricothyroid*** [2]. At risk during ligation of inferior thyroid artery or dissection near Berry's ligament | ***Ipsilateral RLN injury → unilateral vocal cord palsy → hoarseness and ineffective cough. Bilateral RLN injury → bilateral vocal cord palsy → stridor and dyspnoea (airway obstruction)*** [2]. ***6 adductors > 2 abductors → cords tend to adduct → airway obstruction*** [7] | Pre-op laryngoscopy to document baseline. Intraoperative nerve monitoring. If bilateral injury: may need emergency intubation or tracheostomy. ***Management of unilateral injury: cord medialisation procedures — e.g., injection thyroplasty, open thyroplasty (Gore-Tex)*** [7] |
| ***Superior laryngeal nerve (external branch) injury*** | ***SLN supplies the cricothyroid muscle which lengthens (tenses) the vocal cord to produce high-pitched sound*** [2] | ***Vocal fatigue, changes in voice quality, loss of high pitch, poor volume, easy fatigue*** [2][7] | Careful identification of SLN during superior pole dissection. Close to the superior thyroid artery — ligate artery close to gland capsule |
| ***Oesophageal injury*** | Direct surgical trauma | Dysphagia, mediastinitis (if missed) | Intraoperative recognition and primary repair |
| ***Tracheal injury*** | Direct surgical trauma | Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum | Primary repair, consider tracheostomy |
| ***Tracheomalacia*** | ***Floppy tracheal wall due to chronic compression*** by large goitre [7]. Tracheal cartilage rings become softened | Post-extubation stridor and respiratory distress as the trachea collapses without the external splinting effect of the goitre | Anticipate in large/longstanding goitres. May need prolonged intubation or tracheostomy |
| ***Thyroid storm*** | Manipulation of gland during surgery → massive hormone release | Hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension → cardiovascular collapse | ***Patients should be brought to euthyroid before surgery*** [2]. If storm occurs intraoperatively: aggressive medical treatment (PTU + propranolol + hydrocortisone + cooling) |

#### ***Early (Post-operative, Days)***

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Haematoma formation*** | Post-operative reactionary or secondary haemorrhage from thyroid bed vessels | ***Potentially fatal if compression on airways*** [2]. Neck swelling, increasing pain, respiratory distress, stridor. ***Haemorrhage — compression and oedematous effect compresses on trachea*** [2] | ***This is a surgical EMERGENCY.*** Open the wound **at the bedside** immediately — remove skin sutures/clips, evacuate haematoma to relieve tracheal compression. Then return to theatre for formal exploration and haemostasis. ***Removal of stitches and allow drainage of blood*** [2] |
| ***Wound infection*** | Bacterial contamination | Erythema, swelling, discharge, fever | ***Wound infection is NOT a recognised complication in most series (clean surgical field)*** [7]. If occurs: antibiotics, wound care |

<Callout title="Post-Thyroidectomy Neck Haematoma — The Bedside Emergency" type="error">
A patient returning from thyroidectomy who develops neck swelling + respiratory distress requires **immediate bedside wound opening** — do NOT wait for the operating theatre. The expanding haematoma compresses the trachea and can cause fatal airway obstruction within minutes. The clinical sequence: increasing neck swelling → dyspnoea → stridor → respiratory arrest. Every surgical team on a thyroid ward must have **stitch cutters at the bedside**.
</Callout>

#### ***Late (Post-operative, Weeks to Months)***

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Hypoparathyroidism → Hypocalcaemia*** | ***MOST common complication*** [2][7]. Inadvertent removal, devascularisation, or bruising of parathyroid glands → ↓ PTH → ↓ serum calcium. ***Only occurs in total thyroidectomy*** [7] (bilateral risk). ***Usually transient*** [7] — most recover within weeks to months as residual parathyroid tissue recovers | ***Perioral numbness***, ***carpopedal spasm***, ***Chvostek's sign*** (facial nerve tapping → facial muscle twitch), ***Trousseau's sign*** (BP cuff inflation → carpopedal spasm) [2][7]. ***Severe hypocalcaemia can lead to laryngospasm requiring emergency intubation / surgical airway*** [7] | ***Check serum corrected Ca²⁺ or PTH level post-operatively*** [2]. **Acute symptomatic**: ***IV 10–20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over 10 mins (slow bolus)*** [2]. **Maintenance**: ***Calcium carbonate + Calcitriol (Vitamin D)*** [2][7] |
| ***Hungry bone syndrome*** | ***Severe and prolonged hypocalcaemia despite normal or even elevated PTH*** [2]. Occurs particularly after surgery for thyrotoxicosis (or hyperparathyroidism). ***Sudden removal of effect of high circulating levels of PTH/T3 → increased influx of calcium into bones*** [2]. The demineralised skeleton acts as a "calcium sponge." ***Associated with hypophosphataemia and hypomagnesaemia*** [2] | Severe, refractory hypocalcaemia not responsive to standard calcium replacement alone | Aggressive IV and oral calcium + calcitriol + magnesium replacement. May take days to weeks to stabilise |
| ***Hypothyroidism*** | Loss of functioning thyroid tissue | Fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation. ***Around 10–20% chance of hypothyroidism after hemithyroidectomy*** [1]. **100% after total thyroidectomy** | Levothyroxine replacement. Measure TSH at 6 weeks post-hemithyroidectomy to assess need |
| ***Recurrence*** (of goitre/thyrotoxicosis) | Residual thyroid tissue. Only if subtotal thyroidectomy or hemithyroidectomy was performed. Does not occur after total thyroidectomy | Return of thyrotoxic symptoms, palpable goitre | Re-operation (technically more difficult due to scarring) or RAI |
| ***Hypertrophic scar / keloid formation*** | Individual predisposition (more common in Asian skin) | Raised, thickened scar across the neck (Kocher's incision) | Silicone gel sheets, steroid injection, laser therapy |

***Post-operative dyspnoea — Differential Diagnosis*** [7]:

This is a critical clinical scenario. A patient develops respiratory distress after thyroidectomy — think systematically:

| ***Cause*** | ***Mechanism*** | ***Key Features*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Haematoma*** | Bleeding → tracheal compression + laryngeal oedema | Neck swelling, hypovolaemic shock signs. OPEN WOUND AT BEDSIDE |
| ***Bilateral RLN irritation/injury*** | Both vocal cords paralysed in adducted position → airway obstruction | Stridor. May need emergency intubation/tracheostomy |
| ***Laryngospasm from hypocalcaemia*** | Acute hypocalcaemia → neuromuscular hyperexcitability → laryngeal muscle spasm | Check calcium. IV calcium gluconate urgently. May need intubation |
| ***Tracheal injury / pneumothorax*** | Direct surgical trauma | Subcutaneous emphysema, respiratory distress |
| ***Tracheomalacia*** | ***Floppy tracheal wall due to chronic compression*** [7] | Post-extubation stridor. Trachea collapses without goitre "splinting" |

## C. Complications of Specific Aetiologies

### Graves' Disease — Unique Complications

| Complication | Details |
|---|---|
| Graves' ophthalmopathy | Ranges from lid retraction to sight-threatening optic neuropathy (see NO SPECS above) |
| Graves' dermopathy | Pretibial myxoedema — cosmetic, rarely disabling |
| Thyroid acropachy | Clubbing + periosteal new bone — rarest, no specific treatment |
| Neonatal Graves' disease | TRAb (IgG) crosses placenta → stimulates fetal thyroid → neonatal thyrotoxicosis. More likely if maternal TRAb is high in 3rd trimester. Self-limiting (weeks) as maternal antibodies are cleared |

### Toxic MNG — Unique Complications

| Complication | Details |
|---|---|
| Retrosternal extension | Large goitres can extend behind the sternum → compress trachea, oesophagus, SVC (SVC obstruction → facial plethora, raised JVP with arms raised = Pemberton's sign) |
| Malignant transformation | Cold nodules within a MNG carry 10–20% malignancy risk. Important to perform FNAC on suspicious/dominant nodules |
| Jod-Basedow phenomenon | Iodine exposure (contrast, amiodarone) can trigger acute thyrotoxicosis in patients with autonomous nodules |

---

## D. Long-Term Complications Summary Table

| Complication | Aetiology/Context | Pathophysiology | Reversible? |
|---|---|---|---|
| AF | Any thyrotoxicosis, especially elderly | ↑ Atrial ectopic activity + shortened refractory period | Often reverts with euthyroidism |
| Heart failure | Prolonged thyrotoxicosis | Chronic ↑ cardiac work → myocardial exhaustion + direct T3 toxicity | Early: reversible. Late: irreversible fibrosis |
| Osteoporosis | Prolonged thyrotoxicosis or subclinical disease | ↑ Osteoclastic bone resorption | Partially reversible with treatment |
| Thyroid storm | Precipitated event in untreated patient | Massive catecholamine sensitisation | Medical emergency; potentially fatal (10–30%) |
| Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis | Asian males with thyrotoxicosis | T3-driven intracellular K⁺ shift | Fully reversible once euthyroid |
| Ophthalmopathy | Graves' only | TRAb cross-reactivity in orbit | Variable; may progress independently of thyroid status |
| Agranulocytosis | Thionamide treatment | Immune-mediated neutrophil destruction | Reversible if caught early; potentially fatal if missed |
| Hypothyroidism post-RAI | RAI treatment | Radiation destruction of thyroid tissue | Irreversible — lifelong T4 replacement |
| Hypoparathyroidism | Thyroidectomy | Parathyroid removal/devascularisation | Usually transient; permanent in ~1–2% |
| RLN injury | Thyroidectomy | Surgical damage to nerve | Temporary neuropraxia recovers; transection may be permanent |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of Hyperthyroidism — Key Exam Points:**

1. **AF** is the most common cardiac complication (~10–15%). Always check TFTs in new AF. Often reverts with treatment.

2. ***Thyroid storm*** is a medical emergency with 10–30% mortality. Precipitated by surgery/infection/trauma in untreated patients. Treatment: PTU + propranolol + hydrocortisone → iodide after 1 hour. Paracetamol (NOT aspirin) for fever.

3. **Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis** — think young Asian male with acute hypokalaemic paralysis. Fully reversible once euthyroid.

4. ***Hypoparathyroidism is the MOST common complication of thyroidectomy*** — usually transient. Check calcium post-op. Treat with IV calcium gluconate acutely; oral calcium + calcitriol for maintenance.

5. **Post-thyroidectomy neck haematoma** is a life-threatening emergency — **open the wound at the bedside** immediately before theatre.

6. ***Post-op dyspnoea DDx***: haematoma, bilateral RLN injury, laryngospasm (hypocalcaemia), tracheal injury, tracheomalacia.

7. **RLN injury**: unilateral → hoarseness; bilateral → airway obstruction (stridor). **SLN injury** → vocal fatigue, loss of high pitch.

8. ***Agranulocytosis from thionamides***: occurs in first 2–3 months. Educate patients to stop drug and seek urgent FBC if sore throat/fever develops.

9. **Graves' ophthalmopathy**: NO SPECS grading. Sight loss (Grade 6) from optic nerve compression is an emergency requiring IV steroids ± orbital decompression.

10. ***Hungry bone syndrome***: severe hypocalcaemia DESPITE normal/high PTH. Skeleton acts as "calcium sponge" after removal of chronic thyrotoxic/hyperparathyroid stimulation.

This triggers an immune flare with increased TRAb production and T-cell activation, which cross-reacts with TSH receptors on orbital fibroblasts, worsening orbital inflammation. Risk is mitigated by concurrent glucocorticoid prophylaxis (oral prednisolone cover starting around the time of RAI and tapered over weeks). Active or moderate-severe ophthalmopathy is a contraindication to RAI."

Bilateral RLN injury: both vocal cords paralysed in adducted position (6 adductors overpower 2 abductors). Causes stridor, dyspnoea, and airway obstruction. May require emergency intubation or tracheostomy. Unilateral is managed with cord medialisation procedures; bilateral may need tracheostomy or arytenoidectomy."
