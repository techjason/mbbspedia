## Differential Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism / Thyrotoxicosis

When a patient presents with clinical features suggesting thyrotoxicosis — weight loss, tremor, palpitations, heat intolerance — the real clinical challenge isn't just confirming thyrotoxicosis (that's a blood test). The challenge is **determining the cause**, because the management differs dramatically. You don't give carbimazole to someone with subacute thyroiditis, and you don't give steroids to someone with Graves'.

The differential diagnosis operates on **two levels**:

1. **Level 1**: Is this truly thyrotoxicosis, or is it a mimic? (The "broad DDx" of a thyrotoxic-looking patient)
2. **Level 2**: If it IS thyrotoxicosis, what is the underlying cause? (The "aetiological DDx" — distinguishing between causes of thyrotoxicosis)

---

### Level 1: Conditions That Mimic Thyrotoxicosis

Before you even get to the blood results, a patient with anxiety, tremor, tachycardia, weight loss, and sweating could have several other diagnoses. These are conditions that share sympathetic-overdrive features:

| Mimic | Key Distinguishing Features | Why It Mimics Thyrotoxicosis |
|---|---|---|
| **Anxiety disorder / panic disorder** | Normal TFTs. Episodic rather than constant. No goitre, no eye signs, no weight loss despite good appetite | Sympathetic activation → tachycardia, tremor, sweating, palpitations |
| **Phaeochromocytoma** | ***Paroxysmal*** headache, sweating, palpitations, hypertension (cf. Graves' has wide pulse pressure but not typically severe hypertension). 24h urinary catecholamines / plasma metanephrines elevated [6] | Catecholamine excess → direct sympathetic features. Unlike thyrotoxicosis, symptoms are typically episodic/paroxysmal |
| **Cardiac arrhythmia (e.g., SVT, AF)** | Palpitations dominant. No weight loss, no tremor, no heat intolerance. ECG diagnostic | AF can be *caused by* thyrotoxicosis — always check TFTs in new AF |
| **Substance use** (cocaine, amphetamines, excessive caffeine) | History is key. Dilated pupils, agitation. Normal TFTs | Sympathomimetic agents mimic catecholamine excess |
| **Menopause** | Hot flushes (episodic, not constant heat intolerance), irregular menses, age > 45. Normal TFTs. FSH elevated | Vasomotor instability from oestrogen withdrawal |
| **Malignancy (occult)** | Weight loss without increased appetite (anorexia present). Night sweats. Lymphadenopathy | Weight loss + sweating, but appetite is typically DECREASED (vs. thyrotoxicosis where appetite is INCREASED) |
| **Diabetes mellitus (new onset)** | Polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss. Elevated glucose. Normal TFTs | Weight loss + polyuria overlap with thyrotoxicosis. But DM has polydipsia and hyperglycaemia |
| **Heart failure** | Dyspnoea, tachycardia, oedema. But resting, not hypermetabolic. May coexist with thyrotoxicosis | High-output HF can be CAUSED by thyrotoxicosis — so check TFTs |
| **Carcinoid syndrome** | Episodic flushing, diarrhoea, wheezing. 24h urinary 5-HIAA elevated | Flushing + diarrhoea overlap. But carcinoid flushing is episodic and often triggered; thyrotoxic heat intolerance is constant |

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
The single most important screening test to rule in/rule out thyrotoxicosis is **serum TSH**. If TSH is normal, the patient is almost certainly NOT thyrotoxic (exception: the very rare TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma where TSH is inappropriately normal/high). A normal TSH has a negative predictive value of > 99% for primary thyrotoxicosis.
</Callout>

### Level 2: Aetiological Differential Diagnosis — Distinguishing Between Causes of Thyrotoxicosis

Once thyrotoxicosis is biochemically confirmed (suppressed TSH, elevated fT4/fT3), the critical next step is determining the **cause**. This drives management.

***The aetiological differential diagnosis is best approached by dividing causes into those with HIGH radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) versus LOW RAIU*** [1][2][7]:

| RAIU | Category | Causes | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HIGH (diffuse)** | Gland uniformly overactive | ***Graves' disease*** | TRAb uniformly stimulates all TSH receptors → diffuse hyperfunction and iodine trapping |
| **HIGH (patchy/multifocal)** | Multiple autonomous zones | ***Toxic multinodular goitre (TMNG)*** [1][7] | Multiple nodules with activating mutations → patchy autonomous uptake |
| **HIGH (focal, single)** | Single autonomous nodule | ***Toxic adenoma (Plummer's disease)*** [1][7] | Single nodule with activating TSH-receptor mutation → focal "hot" uptake with suppressed surrounding tissue |
| **LOW / absent** | Gland damaged, leaking stored hormone | ***Subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis*** | Post-viral granulomatous inflammation → follicular destruction → passive release of preformed T3/T4. Gland NOT actively trapping iodine |
| **LOW / absent** | Gland damaged, leaking stored hormone | ***Silent (painless) thyroiditis*** | Autoimmune lymphocytic infiltration → follicular destruction → passive hormone release. Often postpartum |
| **LOW / absent** | Drug-induced destruction | ***Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis type 2*** | Direct cytotoxic effect on thyrocytes → hormone leakage |
| **LOW / absent** | Exogenous hormone | ***Factitious thyrotoxicosis / levothyroxine overdose*** [2] | Exogenous T4 suppresses TSH and native thyroid function → gland doesn't take up iodine. Thyroglobulin LOW (key distinguisher) |
| **LOW / absent** | Ectopic thyroid tissue | ***Struma ovarii*** | Ectopic thyroid tissue in ovarian teratoma producing T3/T4. Neck RAIU low but pelvic uptake present |
| **Variable** | TSH-driven | ***TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma*** [2] | TSH is inappropriately normal/elevated → drives thyroid to produce hormone. RAIU may be normal/high |
| **Variable** | hCG-driven | ***Gestational thyrotoxicosis / hCG-secreting tumour*** [2] | hCG cross-stimulates TSH receptor (structural homology with TSH — shared α-subunit, similar β-subunit) [8] |

### Key Differentiating Features — Cause by Cause

#### 1. ***Graves' Disease vs. Toxic MNG vs. Toxic Adenoma***

This is the most common clinical distinction you'll need to make.

| Feature | ***Graves' Disease*** | ***Toxic MNG*** | ***Toxic Adenoma*** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Age** | 30–50 years | > 50 years | 30–50 years |
| **Goitre** | ***Diffuse, smooth*** | ***Multinodular, irregular*** [1] | ***Single palpable nodule*** |
| **Thyroid bruit** | ***Present*** (increased vascularity) [9] | Absent | Absent |
| **Eye signs** | ***Graves' ophthalmopathy*** (proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, periorbital oedema) | Lid lag/retraction only (sympathetic) | Lid lag/retraction only |
| **Pretibial myxoedema** | May be present | Absent | Absent |
| **TRAb** | ***Positive (80–90%)*** [2] | Negative | Negative |
| **Anti-TPO** | ***50–80%*** positive [2] | 10–20% | Usually negative |
| **RAIU scan** | ***Diffusely increased uptake*** [1] | ***Patchy uptake with hot and cold areas*** [1] | ***Single hot nodule with suppressed surrounding tissue*** [1] |
| **Ultrasound** | Diffuse enlargement, increased vascularity ("thyroid inferno") | Multiple nodules of varying echogenicity | Single well-defined nodule |
| **Natural history** | Relapsing-remitting; may remit spontaneously or with ATDs | Progressive; ATDs rarely induce remission | Grows slowly; may cause increasing toxicity over time |

> ***On clinical examination, only 3 conclusions can be derived: thyroid nodule, multinodular goitre, or diffuse goitre*** [9]. This clinical distinction guides further investigation.

#### 2. ***Graves' Disease vs. Subacute (de Quervain's) Thyroiditis***

| Feature | ***Graves'*** | ***Subacute Thyroiditis*** |
|---|---|---|
| **Onset** | Gradual (weeks–months) | Acute (days), often follows URTI |
| **Pain** | ***Painless*** | ***Painful, exquisitely tender thyroid*** |
| **ESR/CRP** | Normal | ***Markedly elevated*** (ESR often > 50 mm/hr) |
| **TRAb** | Positive | Negative |
| **RAIU** | ***High (diffuse)*** | ***Low/absent*** (gland destroyed, not trapping iodine) |
| **Phase** | Sustained hyperthyroidism (unless treated) | ***Triphasic***: thyrotoxic phase (2–8 wks) → hypothyroid phase (weeks–months) → recovery |
| **Treatment** | ATDs, RAI, or surgery | Supportive: NSAIDs/steroids for pain and inflammation, beta-blockers for symptoms. ATDs are USELESS (gland is not synthesising — it's leaking) |

<Callout title="Why are antithyroid drugs useless in thyroiditis?" type="error">
Antithyroid drugs (carbimazole, PTU) work by inhibiting thyroid peroxidase (TPO), which blocks NEW hormone synthesis. In thyroiditis, the problem is RELEASE of PREFORMED hormone from damaged follicles — there's nothing to block. Giving carbimazole to a patient with subacute thyroiditis is a common student mistake. Beta-blockers for symptom control + NSAIDs/steroids for inflammation is all you need.
</Callout>

#### 3. ***Silent (Painless) Thyroiditis vs. Subacute Thyroiditis***

Both present with transient thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism, but:

| Feature | Silent Thyroiditis | Subacute Thyroiditis |
|---|---|---|
| Pain | ***Painless*** | ***Painful*** |
| ESR | Normal or mildly elevated | Very high |
| Aetiology | Autoimmune (lymphocytic infiltration); often ***postpartum*** | Post-viral (granulomatous) |
| Anti-TPO | Often positive | Usually negative |
| Recurrence | May recur, especially with subsequent pregnancies | Rarely recurs |

#### 4. ***Factitious Thyrotoxicosis***

- Exogenous levothyroxine ingestion (intentional or accidental over-replacement).
- **Key distinguishing feature**: ***Thyroglobulin is LOW*** (because the native gland is suppressed and atrophic; exogenous T4 does not generate thyroglobulin). In ALL other causes of thyrotoxicosis, thyroglobulin is normal or elevated.
- RAIU is low (gland suppressed).
- No goitre (gland atrophies due to TSH suppression).

#### 5. ***TSH-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma (TSHoma)*** [2][10]

- Very rare (< 1% of pituitary adenomas, < 1% of thyrotoxicosis cases).
- **Key distinguishing feature**: ***TSH is inappropriately normal or elevated*** despite high fT4/fT3. In all other causes of primary thyrotoxicosis, TSH is suppressed.
- May have features of pituitary macroadenoma: headache, bitemporal hemianopia (compression of optic chiasm), hypopituitarism (compression of normal pituitary).
- Diagnosis: MRI pituitary, α-subunit elevated.

<Callout title="The TSH Paradox">
In virtually all thyrotoxicosis, TSH is suppressed by negative feedback. If you find elevated fT4 with a NORMAL or HIGH TSH, think of only two things: (1) ***TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma)*** — autonomous TSH production, or (2) ***Thyroid hormone resistance syndrome*** — mutations in thyroid hormone receptor → tissues are resistant → hypothalamus/pituitary don't "see" the high T4 → keep making TSH. The key distinguisher: TSHoma patients are clinically THYROtoxic; resistance syndrome patients are clinically EUthyroid (tissues are resistant, so high T4 doesn't cause symptoms) [2][10].
</Callout>

#### 6. ***Gestational Thyrotoxicosis vs. Graves' in Pregnancy***

| Feature | Gestational Thyrotoxicosis | Graves' in Pregnancy |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | First trimester (peaks with hCG at 10–12 weeks) | Any trimester |
| Goitre | Absent or minimal | Present (diffuse) |
| Eye signs | Absent | May be present |
| TRAb | Negative | Positive |
| hCG | Very high (often associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, multiple gestation, or molar pregnancy) | Normal for gestational age |
| Course | Self-limiting — resolves as hCG falls in 2nd trimester | Persists; needs treatment |
| Treatment | Supportive (rehydration, antiemetics). ATDs NOT needed in most cases | PTU in 1st trimester, carbimazole/methimazole in 2nd/3rd trimester |

#### 7. ***hCG-Mediated Thyrotoxicosis from Germ Cell Tumours***

- ***hCG and TSH share a common α-subunit and have considerable β-subunit homology; thus hCG has a weak thyroid-stimulating effect*** [8].
- ***Marked overproduction of hCG (e.g., from hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, testicular germ cell tumour) can cause overt thyrotoxicosis*** [8][11].
- Distinguished from Graves' by: male sex or obstetric history, very high serum hCG, negative TRAb, pelvic/testicular mass.

---

### Special Differential: ***Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT)***

Amiodarone is 37% iodine by weight and has an extremely long half-life (~100 days). It can cause both hypo- AND hyperthyroidism.

| Feature | **AIT Type 1** | **AIT Type 2** |
|---|---|---|
| **Mechanism** | Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow) in pre-existing thyroid autonomy (nodular goitre, latent Graves') | Direct thyrotoxic effect of amiodarone on thyrocytes → destructive thyroiditis → hormone leakage |
| **Underlying thyroid** | Abnormal (pre-existing nodular disease) | Normal |
| **Goitre** | Often present (nodular) | Normal or small |
| **RAIU** | Normal or increased | Low |
| **Colour-flow Doppler USG** | Increased vascularity | Decreased/absent vascularity |
| **Treatment** | Thionamides (± perchlorate to block iodine uptake) | Glucocorticoids (prednisone) |
| **Mixed forms** | Common in practice — treat with both thionamides AND steroids | |

> **Why is colour-flow Doppler useful?** Because it reflects whether the gland is *actively* producing hormone (increased blood flow = type 1) or *passively* leaking it from destruction (absent blood flow = type 2). This is particularly helpful when RAIU is unreliable (amiodarone's iodine load can suppress uptake even in type 1).

### ***Goitre Classification as a DDx Framework*** [1]

***When approaching a thyroid swelling, the goitre classification provides a useful framework*** for differential diagnosis:

| ***Goitre Type*** | ***Causes*** |
|---|---|
| ***Simple goitre (endemic or sporadic) — diffuse*** | Iodine deficiency, physiological (puberty, pregnancy), goitrogens |
| ***Simple goitre — nodular*** | Multinodular goitre (non-toxic) |
| ***Toxic goitre — diffuse (Graves')*** | Autoimmune (TRAb) |
| ***Toxic goitre — nodular (Plummer's / TMNG)*** | Autonomous nodule(s) with activating mutations |
| ***Toxic / functioning adenoma*** | Single autonomous nodule |
| ***Neoplastic goitre — benign*** | Follicular adenoma |
| ***Neoplastic goitre — malignant*** | Papillary, follicular, medullary, anaplastic carcinoma, lymphoma |
| ***Thyroiditis*** | ***Bacterial (acute suppurative), viral (subacute/de Quervain's), lymphocytic/Hashimoto/autoimmune (chronic)*** [1] |

[1]

---

### Approach to a Thyroid Nodule — DDx Overlay [7]

***Around 10–15% of thyroid nodules are malignant*** [7]. When evaluating a thyroid nodule, the differential includes:

| Category | Differential |
|---|---|
| ***Solitary nodule*** | ***Dominant nodule in MNG; cyst (true simple cyst, colloid nodule); neoplastic (adenoma, toxic adenoma, carcinoma)*** [7] |
| ***Multiple nodules*** | ***MNG (hyperplastic/adenomatous nodules with varying cystic degeneration); toxic MNG; multiple cysts; multiple adenomas*** [7] |
| ***Diffuse*** | ***Graves' disease; physiological (pregnancy, puberty); Hashimoto's thyroiditis; de Quervain's / subacute thyroiditis*** [7] |

***The functional status of the nodule (hot vs. cold) is assessed by thyroid scintigraphy (I-123 or Tc-99m), which is indicated when TSH is suppressed*** [1][7]:

- ***Hot nodules*** (hyperfunctioning) → almost never malignant → ***do NOT require FNAC*** [2][7]
- ***Cold nodules*** (hypofunctioning) → ***10–20% risk of malignancy*** → ***require FNAC*** (if sonographic criteria met) [2][7]

***PET CT has NO diagnostic role in thyroid diseases — even malignant nodules can have low uptake*** [7].

<Callout title="Why do hot nodules rarely harbour malignancy?">
Hot nodules are actively taking up iodine and producing thyroid hormone — they are well-differentiated, functional thyroid tissue. Malignant cells (especially papillary and anaplastic carcinoma) are typically poorly differentiated and lose the ability to trap iodine efficiently, making them appear "cold" on scan. Therefore, a cold nodule is the one that worries you. However, note that most cold nodules are still benign (only 10–20% are malignant).

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Differential Diagnosis of Thyrotoxicosis — Key Exam Points:**

1. **First confirm thyrotoxicosis biochemically** (suppressed TSH, elevated fT4 ± fT3). Then determine the CAUSE.

2. **The pivotal investigation** is ***RAIU scan*** — separates HIGH uptake (true hyperthyroidism: Graves'/TMNG/toxic adenoma) from LOW uptake (thyroiditis/exogenous/factitious).

3. ***Graves' is distinguished*** by: diffuse goitre + bruit, ophthalmopathy, positive TRAb, diffusely increased RAIU.

4. ***Subacute thyroiditis is distinguished*** by: PAIN + tenderness, raised ESR, low RAIU, self-limiting triphasic course. ATDs are useless.

5. ***Factitious thyrotoxicosis*** has LOW thyroglobulin (all others have normal/high).

6. ***TSHoma*** is the ONLY cause where TSH is inappropriately normal/high with elevated fT4.

7. ***Hot nodules (on scintigraphy) are almost never malignant*** and do NOT need FNAC. ***Cold nodules carry 10–20% malignancy risk*** and require FNAC.

8. ***hCG can cross-stimulate TSH receptors*** → gestational thyrotoxicosis (physiological) or paraneoplastic thyrotoxicosis (germ cell tumours).

9. **Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis**: Type 1 = iodine-induced (thionamides), Type 2 = destructive (steroids). Colour-flow Doppler helps differentiate.

10. ***On clinical examination, only 3 conclusions: thyroid nodule, multinodular goitre, or diffuse goitre*** — this guides the DDx pathway.
