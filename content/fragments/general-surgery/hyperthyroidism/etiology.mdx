# Hyperthyroidism

## 1. Definition

Let's start by getting the terminology absolutely straight — this is a classic exam trap.

- **Thyrotoxicosis** = the clinical state of **thyroid hormone excess** in the body, regardless of the source. Think of it as the "syndrome" of too much T3/T4 floating around.
- **Hyperthyroidism** = thyrotoxicosis caused specifically by **excess thyroid gland function** (i.e., the gland itself is overproducing hormones).

***Thyrotoxicosis ≠ Hyperthyroidism*** [1][2]. Hyperthyroidism is a **subset** of thyrotoxicosis. You can have thyrotoxicosis *without* hyperthyroidism — for example, in subacute thyroiditis where stored hormone leaks out from a damaged gland, or in exogenous levothyroxine overdose. The gland isn't hyperactive in these cases; it's passive release or external supply.

> **Why does this matter?** Because the management differs fundamentally. You don't give antithyroid drugs (which block hormone *synthesis*) to someone whose thyroid is being *destroyed* and leaking hormone — there's nothing to block. You give supportive care (beta-blockers, steroids for inflammation) instead.

<Callout title="Exam Trap" type="error">
A common mistake is using "hyperthyroidism" and "thyrotoxicosis" interchangeably. Always clarify: Is the gland overactive (hyperthyroidism), or is there hormone excess from another cause (thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism)?
</Callout>

**Etymology:**
- "Hyper-" = excess; "thyroid" = shield-shaped (Greek *thyreos* = shield, referring to the shape of the thyroid cartilage); "-ism" = condition
- "Thyrotoxico-sis" = thyroid + toxic + condition → a state of being poisoned by thyroid hormone

## 2. Epidemiology and Risk Factors

### Epidemiology

- **Prevalence**: Overt hyperthyroidism affects ~1.2–1.6% of the population (higher in iodine-sufficient areas). Subclinical hyperthyroidism (suppressed TSH, normal free T4/T3) has a prevalence of ~0.5–2%.
- **Sex**: Strong female predominance — F:M ratio approximately **5–10:1** for Graves' disease.
- **Age**: Graves' disease peaks in **30–50 years** (younger women). Toxic multinodular goitre (TMNG) peaks in **>50 years** (older patients, often in iodine-deficient regions historically).
- ***High iodine intake is associated with hyperthyroidism*** [2] — this is particularly relevant in Hong Kong and coastal East Asian populations, where dietary iodine from seafood and seaweed is abundant. The Jod-Basedow phenomenon describes iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, especially in patients with pre-existing autonomous nodules or subclinical multinodular goitre who are suddenly exposed to iodine excess (e.g., CT contrast, amiodarone).

### Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Female sex** | Autoimmune diseases in general are more prevalent in females (X-chromosome–linked immune regulatory genes, estrogen effects on immune modulation) |
| **Family history of autoimmune thyroid disease** | HLA associations (HLA-DR3 in Caucasians), CTLA-4, PTPN22 polymorphisms |
| **Other autoimmune diseases** | Type 1 DM, Addison's disease, pernicious anaemia, vitiligo — autoimmune polyglandular syndromes |
| **Smoking** | Specifically increases risk of Graves' ophthalmopathy (not just Graves' disease itself) — mechanism involves orbital fibroblast activation by cigarette smoke components |
| **High iodine intake** | Substrate excess for hormone synthesis; Jod-Basedow effect in autonomous nodules |
| **Stress / psychological trauma** | Proposed trigger for Graves' via neuroendocrine-immune interactions (increased cortisol → immune dysregulation → loss of self-tolerance) |
| **Postpartum period** | Immune rebound after pregnancy-related immunosuppression → postpartum thyroiditis |
| **Medications** | Amiodarone (37% iodine by weight), interferon-alpha, lithium (paradoxically can cause both hypo- and hyperthyroidism), immune checkpoint inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) |
| **Excess exogenous thyroid hormone** | Iatrogenic (over-replacement of levothyroxine) or factitious |
| **Iodine contrast media** | Acute iodine load — risk in patients with pre-existing nodular goitre |

### Hong Kong Context
- Hong Kong is an **iodine-sufficient** region due to high seafood consumption.
- ***Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism*** in Hong Kong [1][3], as in most iodine-sufficient regions.
- Toxic multinodular goitre is relatively less common than in iodine-deficient regions but still seen, particularly in elderly patients.
- Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is an important cause in cardiology patients (prevalent AF population in Hong Kong).

## 3. Anatomy and Function of the Thyroid Gland

### Gross Anatomy
- ***The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland*** located in the anterior neck, wrapping around the **2nd–4th tracheal rings** [4].
- Consists of two **lateral lobes** connected by an **isthmus**. A **pyramidal lobe** (embryological remnant of the thyroglossal duct) is present in ~50% of people, projecting superiorly from the isthmus.
- Weight: ~15–25 g in adults.
- ***The thyroid gland moves with swallowing*** because it is enveloped by the **pretracheal fascia**, which attaches to the trachea and larynx. This is a key clinical sign that distinguishes thyroid swellings from other neck masses [4][5].

> **Clinical Pearl:** Any anterior neck mass that **moves with swallowing** is likely thyroid in origin. A thyroglossal duct cyst moves with **swallowing AND tongue protrusion** (because it is connected to the foramen caecum at the tongue base via the thyroglossal duct remnant).

### Relations
- **Anterior**: Strap muscles (sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid), sternocleidomastoid
- **Posterior**: Parathyroid glands (2 superior, 2 inferior — at risk during thyroid surgery), ***recurrent laryngeal nerve*** (runs in the tracheoesophageal groove) [4]
- **Lateral**: Carotid sheath (common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, vagus nerve)
- **Medial**: Trachea, oesophagus

### Blood Supply
- **Superior thyroid artery** (first branch of external carotid artery)
- **Inferior thyroid artery** (branch of thyrocervical trunk from subclavian artery)
- Sometimes a **thyroidea ima artery** (variable, from brachiocephalic trunk or aortic arch — important to know if performing tracheostomy)
- The thyroid is one of the most vascular organs per gram of tissue in the body — hence the risk of significant bleeding during surgery and the audible **thyroid bruit** in Graves' disease (due to massively increased blood flow).

### Venous Drainage
- Superior and middle thyroid veins → internal jugular vein
- Inferior thyroid veins → brachiocephalic veins

### Lymphatic Drainage
- Pre-laryngeal (Delphian), pre-tracheal, and para-tracheal nodes → deep cervical chain
- Important for staging of thyroid carcinoma

### Innervation (Surgical Relevance)
- ***Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN)***: Motor to all intrinsic laryngeal muscles except cricothyroid. Injury → **vocal cord paralysis** (hoarseness). Bilateral RLN injury → airway compromise (bilateral abductor paralysis) [4].
- ***External branch of superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN)***: Motor to cricothyroid muscle (tensor of vocal cords). Injury → difficulty with high-pitched voice, vocal fatigue. Often called "the nerve of Amelita Galli-Curci" (a famous opera singer who lost her high notes after thyroid surgery).

### Histology and Physiology

**Functional unit**: The **thyroid follicle** — a spherical structure lined by follicular epithelial cells (thyrocytes) surrounding a central lumen filled with **colloid** (thyroglobulin).

**Thyroid Hormone Synthesis (Step by Step):**

1. **Iodide trapping**: The sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) on the basolateral membrane of thyrocytes actively transports I⁻ from blood into the cell (against concentration gradient, 20–40× concentrated). This is the target of **radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy**.
2. **Iodide transport to lumen**: Pendrin (an anion exchanger) on the apical membrane transports I⁻ into the colloid.
3. **Oxidation and organification**: Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) oxidises I⁻ to I⁰ and attaches it to tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin → forms **monoiodotyrosine (MIT)** and **diiodotyrosine (DIT)**. *This is the step blocked by thionamides (carbimazole/methimazole, propylthiouracil).*
4. **Coupling**: TPO couples MIT + DIT → **T3** (triiodothyronine); DIT + DIT → **T4** (thyroxine). T4 is the major product (~90%). T3 is 3–5× more biologically active.
5. **Storage**: T3 and T4 remain bound to thyroglobulin in the colloid. The thyroid stores ~2–3 months' worth of hormone — which is why it takes time for antithyroid drugs to take effect and why thyrotoxicosis in destructive thyroiditis is self-limiting.
6. **Secretion**: TSH stimulates endocytosis of colloid → lysosomal proteolysis of thyroglobulin → release of T3 and T4 into blood.
7. **Peripheral conversion**: ~80% of circulating T3 is produced by peripheral deiodination of T4 (by type 1 and type 2 deiodinases in liver, kidney, muscle). *Propylthiouracil (PTU) additionally blocks this peripheral conversion — advantage in thyroid storm.*

**Transport**: >99% of T3 and T4 circulate **protein-bound** (to thyroxine-binding globulin [TBG], albumin, transthyretin). Only the **free** fraction is biologically active (free T4, free T3).

**HPT Axis**:
- Hypothalamus → **TRH** (thyrotropin-releasing hormone) → anterior pituitary → **TSH** (thyroid-stimulating hormone) → thyroid → T3/T4
- T3/T4 exert **negative feedback** on both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary.
- In hyperthyroidism: **TSH is suppressed** (except in TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma = "secondary hyperthyroidism," where TSH is inappropriately normal or elevated).

**Parafollicular C cells**: Located between follicles. Produce **calcitonin** (lowers serum calcium). Relevant because medullary thyroid carcinoma arises from C cells.

<Callout title="Why is TSH the best screening test for thyroid dysfunction?">
TSH has a log-linear relationship with free T4 — a small change in free T4 produces a large change in TSH. Therefore, TSH is the most sensitive marker for detecting even subtle thyroid dysfunction (subclinical hyper- or hypothyroidism). A suppressed TSH (< 0.1 mIU/L) with normal free T4 = subclinical hyperthyroidism.

## 4. Etiology

***The causes of thyrotoxicosis can be classified based on whether the thyroid gland is overactive (true hyperthyroidism) or not*** [2]:

### Classification of Thyrotoxicosis

| Category | Causes | Key Features |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary Hyperthyroidism** (gland overactive) | ***Graves' disease*** | Most common overall. Autoimmune. Diffuse goitre. |
| | ***Toxic multinodular goitre (TMNG)*** | Most common in elderly/iodine-deficient areas. Multiple autonomous nodules. |
| | ***Toxic adenoma (Plummer's disease)*** | Single autonomous hyperfunctioning nodule. |
| | Metastatic functioning thyroid carcinoma (rare) | Large tumour burden producing thyroid hormone. |
| | Activating mutation of TSH receptor | Congenital/sporadic. |
| | ***McCune-Albright syndrome*** (Gsα mutation) [2] | Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, café-au-lait spots, precocious puberty, autonomous endocrine hyperfunction. |
| **Secondary Hyperthyroidism** (TSH-driven) | ***TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma (TSHoma)*** | Very rare. TSH inappropriately normal/elevated with high T4/T3. |
| | ***Chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-secreting tumour*** | hCG structurally similar to TSH → cross-stimulates TSH receptor. Hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma. |
| | ***Gestational thyrotoxicosis*** | Physiological high hCG in first trimester → transient TSH receptor stimulation. Associated with hyperemesis gravidarum. |
| **Thyrotoxicosis WITHOUT Hyperthyroidism** (gland not overactive) | ***Subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis*** | Post-viral. Painful, tender thyroid. Self-limiting. |
| | ***Silent (painless) thyroiditis*** | Autoimmune variant. Painless. Can be postpartum. |
| | ***Destructive thyroiditis (amiodarone type 2, radiation)*** | Gland destruction → release of stored hormone into blood [2]. |
| | ***Levothyroxine (T4) overdose / factitious thyrotoxicosis*** | Exogenous hormone. Thyroglobulin LOW (vs. all other causes where thyroglobulin is normal/high). |
| | ***Struma ovarii*** | Ectopic thyroid tissue in ovarian dermoid/teratoma producing thyroid hormone. |

[1][2][3]

<Callout title="How to think about etiology" type="idea">
Ask yourself: **Is the thyroid gland making too much hormone, or is hormone being released/supplied from somewhere else?** This determines whether radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) will be HIGH (gland overactive → takes up iodine avidly) or LOW (gland inactive/suppressed → doesn't take up iodine).
</Callout>

### Focus on the Major Causes (HK-relevant)

#### A. Graves' Disease (Most Important — Most Common Cause)

**Pathophysiology:**
- An **autoimmune** condition where B lymphocytes produce **thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI)** — also called **TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb)**.
- These IgG antibodies bind to and **activate** the TSH receptor on thyrocytes, mimicking TSH.
- Unlike TSH, TRAb are **not subject to negative feedback** → unregulated, continuous stimulation → excess T3/T4 production and thyroid hyperplasia/hypertrophy → **diffuse goitre**.
- **Why is the goitre diffuse?** Because TRAb circulates in the blood and stimulates *all* follicular cells uniformly, unlike nodular disease where only certain clones are autonomous.

**Extra-thyroidal manifestations unique to Graves':**
- ***Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO)***: TRAb cross-reacts with TSH receptors expressed on **orbital fibroblasts and adipocytes** → inflammatory infiltration (T cells, macrophages) → glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition and oedema → expansion of retro-orbital tissue → **proptosis** (exophthalmos). Smoking significantly worsens this.
- ***Graves' dermopathy (pretibial myxoedema)***: Same mechanism — TSH receptor expression on dermal fibroblasts → GAG/mucin deposition in skin → raised, non-pitting, "peau d'orange" plaques, typically over the **pretibial** area. Occurs in <5% of patients.
- ***Thyroid acropachy***: Clubbing of fingers/toes. Rarest manifestation (<1%). Pathophysiology poorly understood.

#### B. Toxic Multinodular Goitre (TMNG)

- Typically occurs in patients with **longstanding non-toxic multinodular goitre** where some nodules acquire **activating somatic mutations** in the TSH receptor or Gsα protein → **autonomous** thyroid hormone production independent of TSH.
- More common in **older patients** and in areas with **historical iodine deficiency**.
- Transition to toxicity may be triggered by **iodine exposure** (Jod-Basedow effect): e.g., iodinated contrast dye, amiodarone.

#### C. Toxic Adenoma (Plummer's Disease)

- A **single, autonomous, hyperfunctioning nodule** with an activating somatic mutation in the TSH receptor gene.
- The nodule produces hormone independently → suppresses TSH → the rest of the thyroid gland **atrophies** (because it's not being stimulated).
- On **radioactive iodine scan**: "hot nodule" with **suppressed uptake in surrounding thyroid tissue**.

#### D. Subacute (de Quervain's) Thyroiditis

- **Post-viral** inflammatory destruction of thyroid follicles (often follows URTI).
- Pathophysiology: Viral infection → granulomatous inflammation → **disruption of follicles** → release of preformed T3/T4 into blood → transient thyrotoxicosis (typically 2–8 weeks).
- This is followed by a **hypothyroid phase** (stores depleted) → then **recovery** (euthyroid) in most patients.
- Clinically: **Painful, tender** thyroid gland, fever, raised ESR/CRP, low RAIU.

#### E. Amiodarone-Induced Thyrotoxicosis (AIT)

Amiodarone is 37% iodine by weight and has a very long half-life (~100 days). Two types:
- **AIT Type 1**: Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow) in patients with pre-existing thyroid autonomy (e.g., nodular goitre). RAIU may be normal/increased. Treat with thionamides ± perchlorate.
- **AIT Type 2**: Destructive thyroiditis from direct cytotoxic effect of amiodarone on thyrocytes → release of stored hormone. RAIU is low. Treat with glucocorticoids.
- In practice, mixed forms are common.

## 5. Pathophysiology — Systemic Effects of Thyroid Hormone Excess

Understanding the pathophysiology of thyroid hormone excess explains virtually every clinical feature. Here's the fundamental concept:

**Thyroid hormones (T3 >> T4) enter cells and bind to nuclear thyroid hormone receptors (TR) → increase gene transcription → increase basal metabolic rate (BMR), protein synthesis, and catecholamine sensitivity.**

Key cellular effects:
1. **↑ Basal metabolic rate**: T3 increases Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity in virtually all cells → increases oxygen consumption and heat production.
2. **↑ Catecholamine sensitivity**: T3 upregulates **β-adrenergic receptors** (particularly β1 in the heart) → amplifies the effect of circulating catecholamines (even though catecholamine levels themselves are not elevated). This is why beta-blockers are so effective.
3. **↑ Bone turnover**: T3 stimulates both osteoblasts and osteoclasts, but osteoclast activity predominates → **net bone resorption** → hypercalcaemia, osteoporosis.
4. **↑ GI motility**: Direct stimulation of GI smooth muscle → hyperdefecation/diarrhoea.
5. **↑ Carbohydrate metabolism**: Enhanced glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, intestinal glucose absorption → hyperglycaemia/glucose intolerance.
6. **↑ Lipid metabolism**: Enhanced lipolysis + increased LDL receptor expression → **low total cholesterol and LDL** (opposite to hypothyroidism).
7. **↑ Protein catabolism**: Muscle wasting (thyrotoxic myopathy), proximal weakness.

---

## 6. Classification

### By Mechanism (as above)
1. **True hyperthyroidism** (thyroid overactive) — high RAIU
2. **Thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism** (passive release/exogenous) — low RAIU

### By Severity
- **Subclinical hyperthyroidism**: Suppressed TSH, **normal** free T4 and free T3. Patient may be asymptomatic or have subtle symptoms.
- **Overt (clinical) hyperthyroidism**: Suppressed TSH, **elevated** free T4 and/or free T3.
- ***Thyroid storm (thyrotoxic crisis)***: Life-threatening, extreme thyrotoxicosis with multi-organ decompensation (fever > 40°C, tachycardia, delirium, heart failure, seizures). Usually precipitated by infection, surgery, RAI therapy, iodine contrast, or non-compliance with antithyroid drugs.

### By Etiology (Most Clinically Useful)
- **Graves' disease** — autoimmune, diffuse
- **Toxic multinodular goitre** — multiple autonomous nodules
- **Toxic adenoma** — single autonomous nodule
- **Thyroiditis** — destructive (de Quervain's, silent, postpartum, drug-induced)
- **Exogenous/factitious** — levothyroxine overdose
- **Rare causes** — TSHoma, struma ovarii, hCG-mediated

## 7. Clinical Features

***The clinical presentation of thyrotoxicosis reflects the systemic effects of thyroid hormone excess on virtually every organ system.*** [1][3]

### A. Symptoms (with Pathophysiological Basis)

| System | Symptom | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **General/Metabolic** | ***Heat intolerance, excessive sweating*** | ↑ BMR → ↑ heat production; ↑ peripheral vasodilation to dissipate heat → sweating |
| | ***Weight loss despite increased appetite*** | ↑ BMR exceeds caloric intake → net catabolism. Rarely, some patients gain weight if appetite increase > metabolic rate ("fat Graves'") |
| | Fatigue, weakness | Protein catabolism → muscle wasting; hypermetabolic state = exhausting |
| **Cardiovascular** | ***Palpitations*** | ↑ β1-adrenergic receptor expression in heart → ↑ heart rate and contractility; may feel forceful/rapid heartbeat |
| | Dyspnoea on exertion | High-output cardiac state + respiratory muscle weakness |
| | Chest pain (rare) | Increased myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of increased cardiac output |
| **Neuropsychiatric** | ***Anxiety, irritability, emotional lability*** | ↑ catecholamine sensitivity in CNS → sympathetic overactivation |
| | ***Tremor (fine resting tremor)*** | ↑ β-adrenergic activity in skeletal muscle |
| | Insomnia | Sympathetic overactivation, hypermetabolic state |
| | Difficulty concentrating | CNS hyperexcitability |
| | Psychosis (rare, "thyrotoxic psychosis") | Severe, prolonged excess thyroid hormone effect on CNS |
| **GI** | ***Increased stool frequency / diarrhoea*** | ↑ GI motility (direct T3 effect on smooth muscle + ↑ sympathetic tone) |
| | Increased appetite (hyperphagia) | ↑ BMR → body's attempt to compensate for energy deficit |
| | Nausea, vomiting (in severe cases) | Thyroid storm or Graves'-associated |
| **Musculoskeletal** | ***Proximal myopathy*** (difficulty climbing stairs, rising from chair) | Protein catabolism + accelerated muscle proteolysis → muscle wasting, particularly proximal muscles |
| | Bone pain, fractures (rare) | ↑ Osteoclast activity → osteoporosis |
| **Reproductive** | ***Oligomenorrhoea / amenorrhoea*** | ↑ Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) → altered estrogen/progesterone dynamics; direct effect on GnRH pulsatility |
| | Subfertility | Anovulation from hormonal disruption |
| | Gynaecomastia (males) | ↑ SHBG → ↑ bound testosterone → relative estrogen excess; also ↑ peripheral aromatisation |
| | Erectile dysfunction, ↓ libido | Hormonal imbalance |
| **Dermatological** | ***Warm, moist skin*** | ↑ Peripheral vasodilation + sweating |
| | Hair thinning / fine hair | ↑ Hair cycle turnover → telogen effluvium |
| | ***Pruritus*** | Increased skin blood flow, possible mast cell degranulation |
| | ***Onycholysis (Plummer's nails)*** | Separation of nail plate from nail bed — mechanism not fully understood; possibly related to increased nail matrix turnover |
| **Ophthalmological (General)** | Lid retraction, lid lag, staring gaze | **Not specific to Graves'** — caused by ↑ sympathetic stimulation of Müller's muscle (superior tarsal muscle) in the upper eyelid → eyelid retracts. Present in ANY cause of thyrotoxicosis |
| **Ophthalmological (Graves'-specific)** | ***Proptosis (exophthalmos)***, diplopia, periorbital oedema, eye grittiness/tearing | TRAb-mediated inflammation of retro-orbital tissue → GAG deposition, fibroblast proliferation, fat expansion → increased retro-orbital volume → globe pushed forward. **Only in Graves' disease** |
| **Neck** | Neck swelling, dysphagia, dysphonia | Thyroid enlargement (goitre) compressing oesophagus/trachea/recurrent laryngeal nerve |

<Callout title="Key Distinction: Lid Retraction vs. Proptosis">
**Lid retraction and lid lag** can occur in ANY thyrotoxic patient (sympathetic-mediated). **Proptosis, periorbital oedema, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia** = Graves' ophthalmopathy (autoimmune-mediated, specific to Graves'). Don't confuse the two!
</Callout>

### B. Signs (with Pathophysiological Basis)

**General Examination:**
| Sign | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| ***Fine resting tremor*** (best elicited by placing a piece of paper on outstretched hands) | ↑ β-adrenergic activity |
| ***Warm, moist palms*** | ↑ Peripheral vasodilation + sweating from ↑ BMR |
| ***Tachycardia (resting HR > 90 bpm)*** | ↑ β1 receptor density and sensitivity in heart → chronotropic and inotropic effect |
| ***Atrial fibrillation (AF)*** | ↑ Atrial ectopic activity from catecholamine sensitisation → re-entrant circuits. Occurs in ~10–15% of thyrotoxic patients, more common in elderly and those with TMNG |
| ***Wide pulse pressure / bounding pulse*** | ↑ Cardiac output (↑ HR × ↑ stroke volume) + ↓ systemic vascular resistance (peripheral vasodilation) → high systolic BP, low diastolic BP |
| ***Weight loss*** | Hypermetabolism > caloric intake |
| ***Proximal muscle wasting and weakness*** | Protein catabolism. Test: ask patient to rise from squatting position without using hands |
| ***Hyperreflexia (brisk reflexes)*** | ↑ Nerve conduction velocity and neuromuscular excitability |
| Palmar erythema | ↑ Peripheral vasodilation |
| Spider naevi (rare) | Hyperdynamic circulation |

**Thyroid Examination:**
| Sign | Significance |
|---|---|
| ***Diffuse, smooth goitre*** | Graves' disease — uniform TRAb stimulation |
| ***Nodular goitre*** | TMNG (multiple nodules) or toxic adenoma (single nodule) |
| ***Thyroid bruit / thrill*** | Markedly increased blood flow through the thyroid — **virtually pathognomonic of Graves' disease**. Must be distinguished from a transmitted carotid bruit (check with bell of stethoscope directly over thyroid) |
| Tenderness | Suggests subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis |
| ***Moves with swallowing*** | Confirms thyroid origin of neck mass [4][5] |
| Retrosternal extension | Ask patient to raise arms above head → if obstruction of thoracic inlet → facial plethora, JVP elevation (Pemberton's sign) |

**Eye Examination (Graves' Ophthalmopathy):**
- ***Lid retraction*** (sclera visible above iris = "scleral show")
- ***Lid lag*** (upper eyelid lags behind the globe on slow downward gaze — Von Graefe's sign)
- ***Proptosis / exophthalmos*** (measured by Hertel exophthalmometer; > 18 mm or asymmetry > 2 mm)
- ***Chemosis*** (conjunctival oedema)
- ***Periorbital oedema***
- ***Ophthalmoplegia*** (restrictive — most commonly inferior rectus affected → limitation of upgaze, then medial rectus → limitation of lateral gaze → diplopia)
- ***Exposure keratopathy*** (corneal drying due to incomplete lid closure from proptosis)
- In severe cases: **optic neuropathy** (compression of optic nerve at orbital apex → colour vision loss, reduced visual acuity — an emergency)

> ***Graves' ophthalmopathy is classified using the NOSPECS system or CAS (Clinical Activity Score)*** — important for determining need for immunosuppressive therapy vs. surgery [3].

**Skin Examination:**
- ***Pretibial myxoedema (Graves' dermopathy)***: Raised, non-pitting, waxy, "peau d'orange" plaques on anterior shins. Despite the name "myxoedema," this is NOT hypothyroidism — it's a Graves'-specific autoimmune manifestation.
- ***Thyroid acropachy***: Clubbing + periosteal new bone formation (looks like hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy). Very rare.
- Vitiligo, alopecia areata (associated autoimmune conditions)

**Cardiovascular Examination:**
- ***High-output heart failure***: In severe, longstanding thyrotoxicosis → cardiac decompensation with biventricular failure, oedema, elevated JVP. Why? Chronic ↑ cardiac work → myocardial exhaustion + direct T3-mediated cardiomyocyte apoptosis.
- **Systolic flow murmurs** (ejection systolic murmur due to hyperdynamic circulation)
- **Mitral regurgitation** (papillary muscle dysfunction from thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy)

**Neurological Examination:**
- ***Hyperreflexia*** with shortened relaxation phase
- Fine tremor
- Proximal myopathy
- Rarely: ***thyrotoxic periodic paralysis*** — sudden episodes of severe hypokalemic muscle weakness, particularly in **Asian males**. Mechanism: T3 stimulates Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase → drives K⁺ intracellularly → acute hypokalaemia → muscle paralysis. Triggered by carbohydrate-rich meals, exercise, stress.

<Callout title="Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis" type="error">
This is a high-yield topic for HK exams because it predominantly affects Asian males. It presents as acute flaccid paralysis (often legs > arms) with hypokalaemia. ECG may show U waves, prolonged QT. It mimics Guillain-Barré or hypokalaemic periodic paralysis. The key differentiator is checking thyroid function! Treatment: cautious K⁺ replacement (rebound hyperkalaemia risk), beta-blockers, and definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism.
</Callout>

### C. Features Specific to Graves' Disease (vs. General Thyrotoxicosis)

Only Graves' disease causes:
1. ***Ophthalmopathy*** (proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, periorbital oedema)
2. ***Dermopathy*** (pretibial myxoedema)
3. ***Acropachy*** (clubbing)
4. ***Diffuse goitre with bruit***
5. ***Positive TRAb***

These features are due to the **autoimmune** nature of Graves' — TRAb acting on TSH receptors expressed in extra-thyroidal tissues (orbit, skin, periosteum).

### D. Signs and Symptoms by Cause — Summary Table

| Feature | Graves' | TMNG | Toxic Adenoma | Subacute Thyroiditis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Age | 30–50 | > 50 | 30–50 | Any (post-viral) |
| Goitre | Diffuse, smooth | Multinodular | Single nodule | Diffuse, tender |
| Thyroid bruit | Present | Absent | Absent | Absent |
| Eye signs | Ophthalmopathy | Lid lag only (sympathetic) | Lid lag only | Lid lag only |
| Pretibial myxoedema | Yes (rare) | No | No | No |
| Pain | No | No | No | ***Yes — painful, tender thyroid*** |
| ESR | Normal | Normal | Normal | ***Very elevated*** |
| RAIU | ***Diffusely increased*** | ***Patchy/increased*** | ***Hot nodule, cold rest*** | ***Low/absent*** |
| TRAb | ***Positive*** | Negative | Negative | Negative |

## 8. Special Populations

### ***Thyrotoxicosis in Pregnancy***
- hCG has structural homology with TSH → can stimulate TSH receptors → **gestational thyrotoxicosis** in first trimester (peaks when hCG peaks at ~10–12 weeks).
- Often associated with **hyperemesis gravidarum**.
- Usually self-limiting; resolves by second trimester as hCG declines.
- Must distinguish from Graves' disease in pregnancy (TRAb positive, goitre, eye signs → needs treatment).
- **Treatment**: PTU preferred in first trimester (methimazole associated with rare embryopathy — aplasia cutis, choanal atresia). Switch to methimazole/carbimazole in second trimester (PTU has risk of hepatotoxicity).
- Radioactive iodine is **absolutely contraindicated** in pregnancy.

### ***Thyrotoxicosis in the Elderly***
- May present **atypically** — "apathetic thyrotoxicosis": weight loss, AF, heart failure, depression, apathy — WITHOUT classic sympathetic features (tremor, anxiety).
- AF is often the presenting feature.
- Higher risk of cardiovascular complications.
- TMNG is the more common cause in elderly.

### ***Subclinical Hyperthyroidism***
- Suppressed TSH with normal free T4/T3.
- Associated with increased risk of: **AF** (especially in elderly), **osteoporosis** (especially postmenopausal women), **cardiovascular mortality**.
- Treatment considered when TSH persistently < 0.1 mIU/L, age > 65, or presence of AF/osteoporosis/cardiac risk factors.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Key Concepts for Exams:**

1. ***Thyrotoxicosis ≠ hyperthyroidism*** — thyrotoxicosis is the syndrome of hormone excess; hyperthyroidism specifically means the gland is overactive.

2. ***Graves' disease is the most common cause*** of hyperthyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions (including HK). It is autoimmune, mediated by TRAb stimulating the TSH receptor.

3. The **triad unique to Graves'**: ophthalmopathy, dermopathy (pretibial myxoedema), acropachy. These are TRAb-mediated, NOT from thyroid hormone excess per se.

4. ***RAIU scan*** is the key investigation to distinguish causes: HIGH uptake = hyperthyroidism (Graves'/TMNG/toxic adenoma); LOW uptake = thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism (thyroiditis/exogenous).

5. Clinical features are driven by **↑ BMR** and **↑ catecholamine sensitivity** (β-adrenergic upregulation) — this explains why beta-blockers are the first-line symptomatic treatment.

6. ***Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis*** — think Asian males, acute hypokalaemic paralysis, check TFTs!

7. ***AF in the elderly*** — always check TFTs. Apathetic thyrotoxicosis may present without classic sympathetic features.

8. ***Thyroid moves with swallowing*** — key sign to identify a thyroid mass.

9. **Lid retraction/lid lag** = sympathetic (any thyrotoxicosis). **Proptosis/ophthalmoplegia** = Graves' only (autoimmune).

10. High iodine intake (HK-relevant) can precipitate hyperthyroidism in patients with autonomous nodules (Jod-Basedow phenomenon).

    {
      question: "A 45-year-old woman presents with weight loss, tremor, and palpitations. Her TSH is suppressed and free T4 is elevated. Define the difference between thyrotoxicosis and hyperthyroidism, and give one example of thyrotoxicosis WITHOUT hyperthyroidism.",
      markscheme: "Thyrotoxicosis = state of thyroid hormone excess (any cause). Hyperthyroidism = thyrotoxicosis due to overactive thyroid gland. Example of thyrotoxicosis without hyperthyroidism: subacute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, exogenous levothyroxine, struma ovarii (any one)."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the pathophysiology of Graves' ophthalmopathy, and why does it occur only in Graves' disease and not in toxic multinodular goitre?",
      markscheme: "TRAb (TSH receptor antibodies) cross-react with TSH receptors on orbital fibroblasts and adipocytes causing inflammation, GAG deposition, fat/muscle expansion. TMNG is not autoimmune so no TRAb is produced, hence no ophthalmopathy."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain why lid retraction occurs in any thyrotoxic patient, but proptosis occurs only in Graves' disease.",
      markscheme: "Lid retraction is caused by sympathetic overstimulation of Mueller's muscle (superior tarsal muscle), which occurs in any thyrotoxicosis due to catecholamine hypersensitivity. Proptosis is caused by TRAb-mediated autoimmune retro-orbital inflammation specific to Graves'."
    },
    {
      question: "A 28-year-old Chinese male presents with sudden-onset bilateral lower limb weakness after a large meal. Serum K+ is 2.1 mmol/L. What is the most likely diagnosis, and what is the underlying mechanism?",
      markscheme: "Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Thyroid hormone (T3) stimulates Na+/K+-ATPase causing intracellular potassium shift and acute hypokalaemia, leading to muscle paralysis. Triggered by carbohydrate-rich meals (insulin surge further drives K+ intracellularly). Confirm with TFTs."
    },
    {
      question: "List 3 clinical features that are specific to Graves' disease and explain why they do not occur in other causes of thyrotoxicosis.",
      markscheme: "1) Graves' ophthalmopathy (proptosis) 2) Pretibial myxoedema (dermopathy) 3) Thyroid acropachy. All are mediated by TRAb acting on TSH receptors expressed on extra-thyroidal tissues (orbital fibroblasts, dermal fibroblasts, periosteum). Other causes of thyrotoxicosis do not produce TRAb."
    },
    {
      question: "On a radioactive iodine uptake scan, how would you differentiate Graves' disease from subacute thyroiditis?",
      markscheme: "Graves' disease: diffusely increased RAIU (gland is overactive, avidly traps iodine). Subacute thyroiditis: low/absent RAIU (gland is damaged and leaking stored hormone, not actively synthesising or trapping iodine)."
