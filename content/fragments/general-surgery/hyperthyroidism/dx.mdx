## Diagnostic Criteria and Algorithm

### "Diagnostic Criteria" — What Defines Hyperthyroidism Biochemically?

Unlike many conditions (e.g., diabetes with its HbA1c thresholds or rheumatoid arthritis with its classification criteria), hyperthyroidism doesn't have a formal "points-based" diagnostic criteria system. Instead, the diagnosis is **biochemical**, confirmed by a specific pattern on thyroid function tests (TFTs), combined with clinical context to determine the aetiology.

#### Biochemical Definitions

| Category | TSH | Free T4 | Free T3 | Clinical Significance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Overt primary hyperthyroidism** | ***↓↓ (suppressed, typically < 0.1 mIU/L)*** | ***↑*** | ***↑*** | Full-blown thyrotoxicosis. Both synthesis pathways (T4 and T3) are in overdrive |
| **T3 thyrotoxicosis** | ***↓↓*** | ***Normal*** | ***↑*** | ***2–5% of hyperthyroid patients have ONLY elevated fT3*** [2]. Easy to miss if you don't check fT3. Common in early Graves' or toxic adenoma (preferential T3 secretion) |
| **Subclinical hyperthyroidism** | ***↓ (suppressed)*** | ***Normal*** | ***Normal*** | TSH suppressed but thyroid hormones haven't crossed upper limit yet. Still clinically significant — associated with AF, osteoporosis, cardiovascular mortality |
| **Secondary hyperthyroidism** | ***Normal or ↑ (inappropriately)*** | ***↑*** | ***↑*** | TSH is NOT suppressed despite high T4/T3 → ***TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome*** [2] |

<Callout title="Why is TSH the single best screening test?">
TSH has a **log-linear relationship** with free T4 — even a small rise in free T4 produces a large fall in TSH. This amplification means TSH becomes abnormal BEFORE free T4 leaves the reference range, making it the earliest and most sensitive marker. ***TSH is the MOST sensitive indicator of thyroid function due to its short half-life*** — it reflects real-time pituitary sensing of circulating thyroid hormone [2].
</Callout>

<Callout title="Exam Pitfall: TSH Limitations" type="error">

***TSH should NOT be used as an isolated test*** in these situations [2]:

- **Suspected or known pituitary disease** — TSH may be normal despite central hypothyroidism or inappropriately normal in TSHoma.
- **↑ TSH alone may not necessarily indicate hypothyroidism** — recovery phase of sick euthyroid syndrome, adrenal insufficiency.
- **↓ TSH alone may not necessarily indicate hyperthyroidism** — ***first trimester of pregnancy (hCG stimulates TSH receptor by molecular mimicry)***, high-dose glucocorticoids, dopamine infusion, non-thyroidal illness [2].
</Callout>

### Why Measure Free T4 (not Total T4)?

***T3 and T4 are highly protein-bound*** (>99% bound to thyroxine-binding globulin [TBG], thyroxine-binding prealbumin [transthyretin], and albumin). Only the **free** fraction is biologically active [2].

***Total T3 or T4 are elevated when TBG is increased*** [2]:
- Pregnancy
- Oral contraceptives / oestrogen therapy
- Hepatitis (increased hepatic TBG synthesis)

***Total T3 or T4 are reduced when TBG is decreased*** [2]:
- Androgens
- Hypoalbuminaemia (nephrotic syndrome, liver disease)
- Glucocorticoids

***Free T3 and fT4 are normal in euthyroid patients with these conditions — hence free hormones are preferable over total thyroid hormones*** [2].

> In short: always request **free** T4 and **free** T3 — total values are misleading in any condition that alters binding protein levels.

---

### Why is fT3 Needed in Addition to fT4?

***Both fT3 and fT4 levels are required to determine subclinical or overt hyperthyroidism*** because ***2–5% of patients have ONLY elevated fT3 ("T3 thyrotoxicosis")*** [2]. This occurs because:
- In early Graves' disease and toxic adenoma, the hyperactive gland preferentially secretes T3 (which is 3–5× more biologically active).
- Peripheral conversion of T4→T3 is also upregulated.
- If you only check fT4, you'll miss these cases.

Conversely, in **hypothyroidism**, ***fT3 is NOT needed*** because fT3 can be normal in 25% of hypothyroid patients due to compensatory upregulation of deiodinase enzymes (adaptive peripheral T4→T3 conversion) [2].

---

## Master Diagnostic Algorithm

The diagnostic approach follows a systematic, stepwise algorithm. Let me walk through the logic:

### Step 1: Confirm Thyrotoxicosis Biochemically

***Measure TSH and free T4*** [2]. This is the starting point for every patient with suspected thyroid dysfunction.

### Step 2: Interpret the TSH/fT4 Pattern

Four possible patterns emerge:

| Pattern | TSH | fT4 | Next Step |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | ↓ | ↑ | **Primary thyrotoxicosis confirmed** → proceed to aetiological workup |
| **B** | ↓ | Normal | **Measure fT3** → if ↑: T3 thyrotoxicosis; if normal: subclinical hyperthyroidism |
| **C** | Normal or ↑ | ↑ | ***TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma or thyroid hormone resistance syndrome*** [2] |
| **D** | Normal | Normal | **No thyroid dysfunction** → no further tests needed |

### Step 3: Determine the Aetiology (for Patterns A and B)

This is where clinical assessment and targeted investigations come in:

1. ***Are there features of Graves' disease?*** (diffuse goitre, bruit, ophthalmopathy, dermopathy) → If yes, the diagnosis is likely **Graves' disease**. Confirm with **TRAb**.
2. If no Graves' features → ***Is there a nodular goitre or solitary nodule?*** → Consider **toxic MNG** or **toxic adenoma**. Confirm with ***radionuclide scan (scintigraphy)*** [1][2].
3. If radionuclide uptake is **low** → ***Destructive thyroiditis, iodine excess, or exogenous thyroid hormone*** [2].
4. If none of the above → ***Rule out other causes including stimulation by chorionic gonadotropin*** [2].

### Step 4: Special Investigation Based on Suspected Aetiology

- **TRAb positive** → Graves' disease (no further imaging needed for diagnosis)
- **RAIU scan** → Distinguishes Graves' (diffuse ↑) vs. TMNG (patchy ↑) vs. toxic adenoma (focal hot nodule) vs. thyroiditis (↓)
- **ESR markedly elevated + tender thyroid** → Subacute thyroiditis
- **Low thyroglobulin + low RAIU** → Factitious thyrotoxicosis
- **Inappropriately normal/high TSH** → MRI pituitary for TSHoma

## Investigation Modalities — Detailed Guide

### A. Biochemical Tests

#### 1. ***Thyroid Function Test (TFT)*** — TSH, fT4, fT3

This is the **foundation** of thyroid diagnosis.

| Test | What It Tells You | Key Interpretive Points |
|---|---|---|
| **TSH** | ***Most sensitive indicator*** of thyroid function [2] | Suppressed in primary thyrotoxicosis. Normal/elevated in TSHoma or resistance. ***Do NOT use TSH to monitor treatment response*** — it can remain suppressed for several months after starting ATDs. Use fT4/fT3 instead [2] |
| **Free T4** | Degree of thyrotoxicosis | Elevated in overt disease. Normal in T3 thyrotoxicosis and subclinical disease |
| **Free T3** | Catches T3 thyrotoxicosis | ***Needed because 2–5% have only elevated fT3*** [2]. Also useful to gauge severity — disproportionately elevated fT3 relative to fT4 suggests Graves' (preferential T3 secretion) |

<Callout title="Monitoring Pitfall" type="error">
***Do NOT use TSH level to monitor response to treatment since it can remain suppressed for several months*** after starting antithyroid drugs [2]. The pituitary thyrotrophs have been suppressed for so long that they take time to "wake up." Instead, monitor **fT4 and fT3** to assess response. TSH may take 6–8 weeks (or longer) to normalise.
</Callout>

#### 2. ***CBC with Differentials*** [2]

- **Baseline** before starting thionamides (carbimazole/methimazole, PTU).
- Why? Because thionamides can cause ***agranulocytosis*** (absolute neutrophil count < 500/μL) — a rare (0.1–0.5%) but potentially fatal adverse effect. You need a baseline WBC/neutrophil count to compare against.
- Thyrotoxicosis itself can cause mild neutropenia and relative lymphocytosis.

#### 3. ***LFT (Liver Function Tests)*** [2]

- **Baseline** before starting thionamides.
- Why? Thionamides can cause ***hepatotoxicity*** — PTU more so (hepatocellular pattern, can cause fulminant liver failure); carbimazole/methimazole (cholestatic pattern, usually milder).
- Graves' disease itself may cause mildly deranged LFTs (hepatic congestion from high-output state, or direct T3 effect on hepatocytes).

#### 4. ***Thyroid Antibodies*** [2]

Three key antibodies to know:

| Antibody | What It Detects | Clinical Utility |
|---|---|---|
| ***Thyrotropin receptor antibodies (TRAb / Anti-TSH receptor antibodies)*** | Autoantibodies that stimulate (TSI) or block the TSH receptor | **Diagnostic of Graves' disease** — positive in ***80–90%*** of Graves' [2]. Also used in pregnancy to assess risk of neonatal thyrotoxicosis (TRAb crosses placenta) |
| ***Anti-thyroid peroxidase (Anti-TPO) antibodies*** | Autoantibodies against TPO enzyme | ***50–80% positive in Graves'***; ***90–100% positive in Hashimoto's*** [2]. Present in 10–15% of normal population. Marker of autoimmune thyroid disease generally |
| ***Anti-thyroglobulin (Anti-TG) antibodies*** | Autoantibodies against thyroglobulin | ***50–70% positive in Graves'***; ***80–90% positive in Hashimoto's*** [2]. Important because they can interfere with thyroglobulin assays (relevant for thyroid cancer follow-up) |

**Interpretation summary table** [2]:

| | ***Anti-TSH (TRAb)*** | ***Anti-TPO*** | ***Anti-TG*** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Normal population*** | ***0%*** | ***10–15%*** | ***10–20%*** |
| ***Graves' disease*** | ***80–90%*** | ***50–80%*** | ***50–70%*** |
| ***Hashimoto's thyroiditis*** | ***10–20%*** | ***90–100%*** | ***80–90%*** |
| ***Multinodular goitre*** | ***10–20%*** | ***10–20%*** | ***30–40%*** |

> **Clinical pearl**: If you have classic clinical Graves' (diffuse goitre + bruit + ophthalmopathy) AND positive TRAb, you have your diagnosis and do NOT necessarily need a RAIU scan. TRAb is highly specific. However, if TRAb is negative and the diagnosis is unclear, RAIU scan becomes essential.

#### 5. Additional Biochemical Tests (Context-Dependent)

| Test | When to Order | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **ESR / CRP** | Painful thyroid | Markedly elevated in subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis. Normal in Graves'/TMNG |
| **Thyroglobulin** | Suspected factitious thyrotoxicosis | Low in exogenous T4 ingestion (gland suppressed). High/normal in all other causes |
| **Serum calcium** | All thyrotoxicosis, pre-operatively | Thyrotoxicosis increases bone turnover → mild hypercalcaemia in ~10%. Also baseline for post-surgical hypoparathyroidism risk |
| **hCG** | Pregnancy, suspected gestational thyrotoxicosis, young male with thyrotoxicosis | hCG cross-stimulates TSH receptor. Very high in molar pregnancy, choriocarcinoma, testicular GCT |
| **Serum calcitonin** | Suspected medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) | 95% of MTC produce calcitonin. NOT relevant for hyperthyroidism per se, but part of thyroid nodule workup |

---

### B. Radiological / Imaging Investigations

#### 1. ***Thyroid Ultrasound (USG)*** [1][2][7]

***USG is a routine investigation for all patients with a goitre or palpable thyroid nodule*** [1][7].

**Characteristics of USG:**
- ***Non-invasive, no radiation, convenient and cheap*** [1]
- ***Highly sensitive but relatively low specificity*** [1]

***Roles of thyroid USG*** [7]:
- ***Assess thyroid gland size*** (goitre)
- ***Assess nodules: number, size, and suspicious features***
- ***Assess cervical lymph nodes*** (especially deep nodes, e.g., level VI nodes)
- ***Assess retrosternal extension***
- ***Guide FNAC***
- ***Extend physical examination*** [1]
- ***NOT recommended as a screening test*** in the general population [1]

**USG Findings in Hyperthyroidism by Cause:**

| Cause | USG Findings |
|---|---|
| **Graves' disease** | Diffusely enlarged, hypoechoic gland ("thyroid inferno" on colour-flow Doppler = markedly increased vascularity). No discrete nodules |
| **Toxic MNG** | Multiple nodules of varying size, echogenicity, and cystic degeneration |
| **Toxic adenoma** | Single, well-defined nodule; may be hyper- or isoechoic; surrounding gland often atrophic |
| **Subacute thyroiditis** | Diffusely hypoechoic, heterogeneous; focal hypoechoic areas corresponding to inflammation. Reduced vascularity on Doppler |

***Sonographic features suspicious of malignancy*** (relevant when evaluating nodules found incidentally in hyperthyroid patients) — ***mnemonic: "SHIT CME"*** [7]:

- ***S = Solid nodule***
- ***H = Hypoechoic***
- ***I = Irregular margin***
- ***T = Taller than wide (AP > transverse)***
- ***C = Chaotic central vascularity***
- ***M = Microcalcifications***
- ***E = Extrathyroidal extension***

> ***Most important features: solid AND hypoechoic*** [7]

***Sonographic features of malignant lymph nodes*** [2]:
- ***Large > 2 cm***
- ***Roundish (taller than wide)***
- ***Heterogeneous hypoechoic***
- ***Loss of central fatty hilum***
- ***Presence of microcalcification***
- ***Intranodal cystic or coagulative necrosis***

**USG Risk Stratification for FNAC (ATA 2015 Guidelines):**

| ***Sonographic Pattern*** | ***USG Features*** | ***Risk of Malignancy*** | ***FNA Size Cut-off*** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***High suspicion*** | ***Solid hypoechoic + ≥ 1 suspicious feature (microcalcifications, irregular margins, taller than wide, ETE, rim calcification with extrusive soft tissue)*** | ***> 70–90%*** | ***≥ 1 cm*** [2][7] |
| ***Intermediate suspicion*** | ***Hypoechoic solid nodule WITHOUT suspicious features*** | ***10–20%*** | ***≥ 1 cm*** [2][7] |
| ***Low suspicion*** | ***Isoechoic / hyperechoic solid nodule, or partially cystic with eccentric solid areas, WITHOUT suspicious features*** | ***5–10%*** | ***≥ 1.5 cm*** [2][7] |
| ***Very low suspicion*** | ***Partially cystic nodule without suspicious features, spongiform*** | ***≤ 3%*** | ***≥ 2 cm or observe*** [7] |
| ***Benign*** | ***Purely cystic nodules*** | ***≤ 1%*** | ***No biopsy*** [7] |

---

#### 2. ***Radionuclide Scan / Thyroid Scintigraphy*** [1][2][7]

**Isotopes used**: ***I-123, Tc-99m pertechnetate, or I-131*** [1]

***NOT recommended for routine diagnostic use*** [2]. This is important — you don't order a scan on everyone.

***Indications*** [2][7]:
1. ***Patient with a thyroid nodule AND suppressed TSH*** — to determine if the nodule is hyperfunctioning ("hot")
2. ***Differentiate between causes of thyrotoxicosis*** when clinical assessment and TRAb are inconclusive
3. ***Patient with MNG*** — to determine functional status of each nodule (which are hot, which are cold)
4. ***Differentiate toxic nodule (→ hemithyroidectomy) vs toxic MNG / Graves' (→ total thyroidectomy)*** [7]

***NOT performed when TSH is normal or elevated*** — because in a euthyroid or hypothyroid patient, a nodule will never be hyperfunctioning, and USG ± FNAC is the appropriate pathway [2].

**Interpretation:**

| ***Scan Pattern*** | ***Uptake*** | ***Diagnosis*** | ***Next Step*** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Diffusely increased uptake*** | High, uniform | ***Graves' disease*** [1] | TRAb confirmation; treat medically or RAI/surgery |
| ***Patchy / multifocal increased uptake*** | Heterogeneous | ***Toxic multinodular goitre*** [1] | Cold nodules in the MNG → FNAC |
| ***Single hot nodule with suppressed surrounding tissue*** | Focal high uptake | ***Toxic adenoma*** [1] | ***Hot nodules do NOT require FNAC*** [2] — treat as toxic adenoma |
| ***Low / absent uptake*** | Globally reduced | ***Thyroiditis, exogenous T4, iodine excess*** | ESR, thyroglobulin, drug history |
| ***Single cold nodule*** | Reduced focal uptake | Possible malignancy | ***Cold nodules have 10–20% risk of cancer → require FNAC*** [2] |

***Radio-isotope scintigraphy — diagnosis of malignancy: low sensitivity and specificity*** [1]. Its value is NOT in diagnosing cancer — it's in **functional assessment** of thyrotoxic patients.

<Callout title="Why do hot nodules NOT require FNAC?" type="idea">
Hot (hyperfunctioning) nodules are actively trapping iodine and producing thyroid hormone — this means they are well-differentiated, functional thyroid tissue. Cancer cells are typically poorly differentiated, lose iodine-trapping ability, and appear "cold." The risk of malignancy in a hot nodule is < 1%. Performing FNAC on a hot nodule wastes resources and can give misleading results (follicular cells from a functioning adenoma can look atypical).
</Callout>

---

#### 3. ***CT Scan / MRI*** [1][7]

***Not routine. Selective indications*** [7]:

1. ***Retrosternal goitre*** — USG cannot visualise below the thoracic inlet; CT delineates the retrosternal extent, relationship to great vessels, tracheal compression/deviation [7]
2. ***Locally advanced thyroid cancer*** — CT with contrast for better delineation of important structures within the cervical fascial planes (carotid sheath, oesophagus, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement) [7]
3. **Surgical planning** for large goitres

> ***Retrosternal goitre requires CT because: (1) Cannot be visualised by USG, (2) Surgical planning, (3) Retrosternal goitre may be malignant*** [7]

**Caution**: Iodinated CT contrast can exacerbate thyrotoxicosis (Jod-Basedow) or interfere with subsequent RAI therapy (saturates iodine stores). Must wait ≥ 4–6 weeks after iodinated contrast before RAI therapy or RAIU scan.

#### 4. ***PET Scan*** [1][7]

***PET CT has NO diagnostic role in thyroid diseases — even malignant nodules can have low uptake*** [7].

- PET incidentalomas (incidentally found thyroid uptake on PET) do warrant workup (thyroid FDG uptake has ~30–50% malignancy rate), but PET is NOT ordered primarily to evaluate thyroid pathology.

#### 5. ***CXR (Thoracic Inlet View)*** [1]

- Assess tracheal deviation/compression from goitre
- Evaluate for retrosternal extension
- Baseline before RAI therapy or surgery

#### 6. ***Endoscopy (Laryngoscopy)*** [1]

- ***Pre-operative vocal cord assessment*** — flexible nasopharyngoscopy to document baseline vocal cord function before thyroid surgery. If a patient already has vocal cord paralysis pre-operatively (from tumour invasion of RLN), the surgeon must know to preserve the contralateral nerve.

---

### C. ***FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology)*** [1][2][7]

***FNAC is a routine investigation*** for thyroid nodules meeting certain criteria [1].

**Key principle**: ***Core needle biopsy is NOT performed*** on the thyroid because it can lead to ***massive bleeding*** (thyroid is extremely vascular) and ***FNAC is very accurate*** in identifying thyroid cancer types [2].

***FNAC is both diagnostic and therapeutic for thyroid cysts*** [7] — aspiration collapses the cyst.

***Indications for FNAC*** [2]:
- Nodules meeting ***sonographic criteria for FNA*** (see USG risk stratification table above)
- ***Hypofunctioning ("cold") nodules*** on scintigraphy
- ***Dominant or atypical nodule*** in a multinodular goitre
- ***Nodules associated with abnormal lymph nodes***
- ***Complex or recurrent cystic nodules***

***NOT indicated***:
- ***Hot nodules*** on scintigraphy (almost never malignant)
- Purely cystic nodules (benign, ≤ 1% malignancy)

**Limitation**: ***Cannot distinguish follicular adenoma from follicular carcinoma*** — because the distinction requires demonstration of capsular/vascular invasion on histology, which FNAC (cytology only) cannot assess. This is why Bethesda Class IV ("follicular neoplasm") requires surgical excision (lobectomy) for definitive diagnosis [7].

***Complications of FNAC***: ***pain, bleeding, false negative*** [7]

---

### D. ***Bethesda Classification System*** — Cytology Reporting [2][7]

***The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology*** standardises FNAC results into 6 categories with corresponding malignancy risk and recommended management:

| ***Class*** | ***Diagnostic Category*** | ***Cancer Risk*** | ***Recommended Management*** |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***I*** | ***Non-diagnostic / Unsatisfactory*** | ***1–4%*** | ***Repeat FNA*** (under USG guidance) |
| ***II*** | ***Benign*** | ***0–3%*** | ***Clinical follow-up*** (repeat USG in 12–24 months) |
| ***III*** | ***Atypia of Undetermined Significance (AUS) OR Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (FLUS)*** | ***5–15%*** | ***Repeat FNA*** (consider molecular testing if available) |
| ***IV*** | ***Follicular Neoplasm / Suspicious for Follicular Neoplasm*** | ***15–30%*** | ***Surgical lobectomy*** (need histology to distinguish adenoma from carcinoma) |
| ***V*** | ***Suspicious for Malignancy*** | ***60–75%*** | ***Surgical lobectomy ± frozen section → total thyroidectomy*** |
| ***VI*** | ***Malignant*** | ***97–99%*** | ***Total thyroidectomy*** (± neck dissection) |

[1][2][7]

> ***Note: Bethesda Class III "atypia" is a morphological description rather than a premalignant lesion*** [7]. It represents indeterminate cytology that doesn't fit neatly into benign or suspicious categories.

***Approach to multiple nodules*** [7]:
- ***Malignancy risk is much lower*** in multinodular goitres
- ***USG: assess each nodule separately***
- ***FNAC decision depends on USG result***:
  - ***If no suspicious nodules → FNA the largest nodule***
  - ***If any suspicious nodules → FNA all suspicious nodules***

### E. Summary: ***Routine vs. Selective Investigations*** [7]

| | ***Routine*** | ***Selective*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***History + Physical exam*** | ***✓*** | |
| ***Thyroid function test*** | ***✓*** | |
| ***USG thyroid ± FNAC*** | ***✓*** | |
| ***Thyroid scan*** | ***✗*** | ***Only in toxic (suppressed TSH) + nodules*** [7] |
| ***CT scan*** | ***✗*** | ***Only when (1) retrosternal goitre or (2) locally advanced thyroid cancer*** [7] |
| ***PET scan*** | ***✗*** | ***NO diagnostic role at all*** [7] |

### F. Specific Investigations for Graves' Ophthalmopathy

***Graves' ophthalmopathy is graded using the "NO SPECS" scoring system*** [2]:

| ***Grade*** | ***Category*** | ***Features*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***0*** | ***No signs and symptoms*** | — |
| ***1*** | ***Only signs, no symptoms*** | ***Lid retraction and lid lag (result of excess sympathetic activity — not specific to Graves')*** → staring appearance [2] |
| ***2*** | ***Soft tissue involvement*** | ***Periorbital oedema*** |
| ***3*** | ***Proptosis*** | ***Best detected by visualising sclera between lower border of iris and lower eyelid*** [2] |
| ***4*** | ***Extraocular muscle involvement*** | ***Diplopia/ophthalmoplegia — inferior rectus affected first, then goes anticlockwise (IR → MR → SR → LR)*** [2] |
| ***5*** | ***Corneal involvement*** | ***Corneal ulceration, scleral injection, chemosis, conjunctivitis*** |
| ***6*** | ***Sight loss*** | ***Compression of CN II → papilloedema, peripheral field defects, blindness*** [2] |

**Investigations for ophthalmopathy**: CT or MRI orbits (shows enlarged extraocular muscles, proptosis, increased retro-orbital fat), visual acuity and colour vision testing, formal perimetry, Hertel exophthalmometry.

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Diagnosis of Hyperthyroidism — Key Exam Points:**

1. ***TSH is the single most sensitive screening test.*** Suppressed TSH = suspect primary hyperthyroidism. Normal/high TSH with elevated fT4 = TSHoma or resistance.

2. ***Always measure BOTH fT4 AND fT3*** — 2–5% have only elevated fT3 ("T3 thyrotoxicosis").

3. ***Measure FREE (not total) T4*** — total T4 is misleading when binding proteins are altered (pregnancy, OCP, hypoalbuminaemia).

4. ***Do NOT use TSH to monitor treatment*** — it remains suppressed for months. Use fT4/fT3 instead.

5. ***TRAb is 80–90% sensitive for Graves'*** and is the key serological differentiator.

6. ***RAIU scan is NOT routine*** — indicated ONLY when TSH is suppressed AND you need to distinguish the cause (especially Graves' vs TMNG vs toxic adenoma vs thyroiditis).

7. ***Hot nodules do NOT require FNAC*** (< 1% malignancy). ***Cold nodules require FNAC*** (10–20% malignancy risk).

8. ***Routine investigations***: TFT + USG thyroid ± FNAC. ***Selective***: thyroid scan, CT, PET (PET has NO diagnostic role).

9. ***Bethesda system***: 6 categories. Class IV (follicular neoplasm) requires lobectomy because FNAC cannot distinguish follicular adenoma from carcinoma (needs capsular/vascular invasion on histology).

10. ***Pre-ATD baseline***: Always check CBC (agranulocytosis risk) and LFT (hepatotoxicity risk) before starting thionamides.

Therefore, surgical lobectomy is needed for definitive diagnosis."

      question: "Before starting a patient on carbimazole for Graves disease, what two baseline blood tests must you order and why?",
      markscheme: "1) CBC with differentials: baseline because carbimazole can cause agranulocytosis (rare but potentially fatal). 2) LFT: baseline because thionamides can cause hepatotoxicity (PTU causes hepatocellular damage; carbimazole/methimazole causes cholestatic pattern)."
