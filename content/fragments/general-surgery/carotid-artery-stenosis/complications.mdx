## Complications of Carotid Artery Stenosis

Complications can be organised into two major domains:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (i.e., what happens if carotid stenosis is left untreated or progresses).
2. **Complications of treatment** (i.e., procedural complications of CEA and CAS, and side effects of medical therapy).

Both are clinically important and frequently tested. Let's work through each systematically from first principles.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

The entire rationale for treating carotid stenosis is to prevent its downstream consequences. If untreated, the natural history of significant carotid stenosis is progressive plaque instability, thromboembolism, and ultimately stroke.

#### 1.1 Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)

- **Mechanism**: Embolus from an unstable carotid plaque temporarily occludes an intracranial vessel → focal ischaemia → symptoms resolve spontaneously as the embolus fragments or lyses.
- **Why it matters**: A TIA is a **warning shot**. The risk of subsequent completed stroke is **highest in the first 48–72 hours** after a TIA (~5% at 48 hours, ~10% at 7 days). This is why TIA in the setting of carotid stenosis is a medical urgency requiring expedited investigation and treatment [1].
- **Clinical features**: Ipsilateral amaurosis fugax, contralateral hemiparesis (face + arm > leg), hemisensory loss, aphasia (dominant hemisphere), neglect (non-dominant hemisphere). All symptoms resolve completely, typically within 1 hour.

#### 1.2 Ischaemic Stroke

- **Mechanism**: Same as TIA, but the embolus causes **sustained occlusion** of an intracranial artery for long enough to cause **irreversible neuronal death** (infarction). The ischaemic core expands to consume the penumbra if reperfusion is not achieved in time [1].
- **Stroke subtypes from carotid stenosis**:
  - **Territorial infarction** (most common): Large MCA or ACA territory infarct from artery-to-artery thromboembolism.
  - **Watershed (border-zone) infarction**: From haemodynamic failure in very high-grade stenosis with inadequate collaterals — occurs at the boundary between ACA/MCA and MCA/PCA territories.
  - **Retinal infarction**: Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) — permanent monocular blindness.

#### 1.3 Consequences of Completed Stroke

Once a stroke occurs, the complications cascade [7]:

| Category | Complications | Pathophysiology |
|---|---|---|
| **CNS complications** | ***Seizures*** | Ischaemic cortex becomes irritable → abnormal electrical discharges. More common with cortical involvement. Prophylactic anticonvulsants are NOT recommended [7][10] |
| | ***Cerebral oedema*** | Cytotoxic oedema (intracellular swelling from energy failure) → peaks at 3–5 days → can cause midline shift and herniation. Large MCA territory infarcts are at highest risk (***malignant MCA syndrome*** — massive infarct with eye deviation, dense hemiplegia, progressive drowsiness ± unequal pupil size) [10] |
| | ***Hydrocephalus*** | Swollen infarcted cerebellum or large hemispheric infarct can obstruct CSF pathways → obstructive hydrocephalus [7][10] |
| | ***Herniation*** | Uncal herniation (temporal lobe through tentorium) or tonsillar herniation (cerebellar tonsils through foramen magnum) → brainstem compression → death if untreated [7] |
| | **Haemorrhagic transformation** | Ischaemic tissue becomes reperfused (either spontaneously or after thrombolysis) → damaged blood-brain barrier allows blood to leak into the infarct. Risk increased by anticoagulation, large infarct size, and late reperfusion |
| **Systemic complications** | ***Myocardial infarction (MI)*** | Atherosclerosis is systemic — coexisting CAD. Haemodynamic stress of acute stroke triggers demand ischaemia or plaque rupture in coronary arteries. MI is a leading cause of death in the post-stroke period [7] |
| | ***Heart failure*** | Stress cardiomyopathy, takotsubo, or decompensation of pre-existing cardiac disease |
| | ***Dysphagia*** | Brainstem or bilateral cortical stroke impairs the swallowing reflex (CN IX, X, XII nuclei) [7] |
| | ***Aspiration pneumonia*** | Direct consequence of dysphagia — silent aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions and food into the lungs → chemical pneumonitis → bacterial superinfection [7] |
| | ***Urinary tract infection*** | Neurogenic bladder from stroke → urinary retention → catheterisation → catheter-associated UTI [7] |
| | ***Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) / Pulmonary embolism (PE)*** | Immobilisation of the paretic limb → venous stasis → thrombosis. DVT prophylaxis (LMWH, compression stockings) is essential [7] |
| | ***Pressure sores*** | Immobility + impaired sensation → prolonged pressure on bony prominences → skin necrosis [7] |
| | ***Dehydration / Malnutrition*** | Dysphagia limits oral intake; reduced consciousness impairs thirst mechanisms [7] |
| | ***Orthopaedic complications and contractures*** | Prolonged immobility → joint stiffness, muscle shortening, frozen shoulder on the hemiplegic side [7] |

#### 1.4 Post-Stroke Depression

This is common and clinically underappreciated [7]:
- **Prevalence**: ***29%*** of patients at any time after stroke [7].
- **Timing**: ***Depression at 3 months after stroke is correlated with a poor outcome at 1 year*** [7] — it impairs rehabilitation, reduces medication compliance, and increases mortality.
- **Predictors**: ***Disability, anxiety, pre-stroke depression, cognitive impairment, increased severity of stroke*** [7].
- **Mechanism**: Multifactorial — structural damage to serotonergic/noradrenergic pathways, psychosocial response to disability, and neuroinflammation.
- **Management**: SSRI antidepressants (e.g., sertraline, citalopram), psychological support, neurorehabilitation.

<Callout title="Post-Stroke Depression — Don't Forget It" type="error">
Post-stroke depression is the most common psychiatric complication of stroke. It is frequently under-diagnosed and under-treated. Always screen for depression in stroke patients at follow-up. Early treatment improves functional outcomes and quality of life.

### 2. Complications of Treatment — Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA)

CEA is an open surgical procedure at a critical anatomical site (the neck) with multiple vital structures in close proximity. Understanding the complications requires understanding the surgical anatomy.

#### 2.1 Perioperative Stroke

- **Incidence**: ~2–3% for symptomatic stenosis (acceptable if < 6%); ~1–1.5% for asymptomatic stenosis (acceptable if < 3%) [1].
- **Mechanism**: ***Factors contributing to stroke include plaque emboli, improper flushing, poor cerebral protection, or relative hypotension*** [1].
  - **Plaque emboli**: During dissection and manipulation of the carotid bifurcation, friable plaque fragments can dislodge and embolise to the brain.
  - **Improper flushing**: Before restoring flow after endarterectomy, the artery must be "back-bled" (flushed) to expel any debris. Inadequate flushing allows residual debris to embolise distally.
  - **Poor cerebral protection**: If the Circle of Willis is incomplete and a shunt is not used during carotid clamping, the ipsilateral hemisphere may become critically ischaemic during the clamping period.
  - **Relative hypotension**: Baroreceptor disruption during surgery, effects of general anaesthesia, or blood loss can cause hypotension → reduced collateral perfusion to the clamped hemisphere.

#### 2.2 Cerebral Hyperperfusion Syndrome

This is one of the most important and frequently tested complications:

- **Incidence**: ~1–3% after CEA or CAS.
- **Pathophysiology** (from first principles) [1]:
  1. In chronic carotid stenosis, the cerebral small vessels downstream are **chronically maximally dilated** — this is a compensatory mechanism to maintain cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite reduced perfusion pressure. The vessels have **lost the ability to autoregulate** (i.e., they can no longer constrict in response to increased perfusion pressure).
  2. After revascularisation (CEA or CAS), blood flow is suddenly restored to a high perfusion pressure in the previously hypoperfused hemisphere.
  3. ***Dilated vessels are unable to vasoconstrict sufficiently to protect the capillary bed due to loss of cerebral blood flow autoregulation.***
  4. ***Breakthrough perfusion pressure thus causes haemorrhage and oedema*** [1].
- **Clinical features**: Typically presents **days to weeks** after the procedure:
  - Severe ipsilateral headache (most common early symptom)
  - Seizures (focal or generalised)
  - Focal neurological deficits
  - Intracerebral haemorrhage (most severe manifestation — can be fatal)
- **Risk factors**: Very high-grade pre-operative stenosis (>90%), contralateral ICA occlusion (maximally stressed autoregulatory capacity), poor collateral circulation, post-operative hypertension.
- **Prevention**: ***Strict post-operative BP control*** — maintain BP between ***100–150 mmHg*** [1]. Arterial line monitoring is standard of care.
- **Treatment**: Aggressive BP lowering (IV labetalol or nicardipine), seizure control (IV levetiracetam or phenytoin), and ICU monitoring. If ICH occurs, manage as for any intracerebral haemorrhage.

<Callout title="Why Does the Brain Bleed After We Fix the Stenosis?">
Think of it like a garden hose connected to a sprinkler system that has been running on low water pressure for years. The sprinkler heads have been opened to maximum to compensate. Now you suddenly turn the water pressure up to full. The sprinkler heads cannot close fast enough — the system overflows and bursts. The same principle applies: chronically dilated cerebral arterioles cannot constrict fast enough when perfusion pressure is suddenly restored, so the capillary bed is overwhelmed.
</Callout>

#### 2.3 Myocardial Infarction

- **Incidence**: ~1–2% perioperatively. **Leading cause of perioperative mortality** after CEA.
- **Mechanism**: Atherosclerosis is systemic. Perioperative haemodynamic fluctuations (hypotension during clamping, hypertension post-operatively), sympathetic activation, and fluid shifts can precipitate demand ischaemia or acute plaque rupture in coronary arteries.
- **Prevention**: Pre-operative cardiac evaluation (stress testing, echo), optimisation of cardiac medications (beta-blockers, statins), careful perioperative haemodynamic management.

#### 2.4 Carotid Restenosis

- **Incidence**: ***Occurs in 2–10% at 5 years*** [1].
- **Pathophysiology**: Two temporal patterns:
  - **Early restenosis ( < 2 years)**: Predominantly **neointimal hyperplasia** — smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition at the endarterectomy site. This is the vessel wall's "healing response" to surgical injury. Often clinically benign (smooth, stable lesion).
  - **Late restenosis ( > 2 years)**: Predominantly **recurrent atherosclerosis** — the same disease process that caused the original stenosis. More likely to be symptomatic (ulcerated, unstable plaque).
- **Detection**: ***Duplex USG surveillance at 3–6 weeks (baseline), 6 months, and annually*** [1].
- **Management**: Asymptomatic < 70% → continue BMT and surveillance. Symptomatic or asymptomatic ≥70% → consider re-intervention (CAS preferred for post-CEA restenosis due to hostile neck).
- **Prevention**: ***Patch angioplasty*** (rather than primary closure) ***is associated with a decrease in frequency of restenosis and lower rate of ipsilateral stroke*** [1].

#### 2.5 Cranial Nerve Injury

This is the most characteristic complication of CEA — unique to this operation because of the dense concentration of cranial nerves in the surgical field:

| Nerve | Incidence | Clinical Manifestation | Anatomical Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***CN XII (hypoglossal)*** | **Most frequently involved** [1] | Tongue deviates **towards** the side of injury (ipsilateral) on protrusion. Difficulty with speech and mastication | The hypoglossal nerve crosses over the ICA and ECA at approximately the level of the carotid bifurcation — it is directly in the surgical field and vulnerable to retraction injury |
| ***CN VII (marginal mandibular branch)*** | Less common | Ipsilateral lower lip weakness → asymmetric smile, drooling. The patient cannot depress the lower lip on the affected side | The marginal mandibular branch runs superficially along the inferior border of the mandible and may be injured during superior retraction for high carotid bifurcation exposure [1] |
| ***CN X (vagus — recurrent laryngeal nerve)*** | Important | **Hoarseness** (ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis) | The vagus nerve runs posterior to the CCA in 90–95% of individuals. The superior laryngeal nerve (branch of X) and recurrent laryngeal nerve are at risk during dissection [1] |
| ***CN IX (glossopharyngeal)*** | Less common | Difficulty swallowing, loss of gag reflex | Runs deep in the carotid sheath, can be injured during high dissection [1] |
| ***Sympathetic chain*** | Uncommon | ***Horner's syndrome*** — ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis | The cervical sympathetic chain runs posterior to the carotid sheath and can be damaged during deep dissection [1] |

- **Prognosis**: Most cranial nerve injuries after CEA are from **traction/retraction** (neuropraxia) rather than transection, and therefore **most recover spontaneously** within weeks to months. Permanent injury is rare ( < 1%).

#### 2.6 Cervical Haematoma

- **Incidence**: ~3–5%.
- **Mechanism**: Bleeding from the arteriotomy suture line, small venous tributaries, or disrupted surgical planes in the neck.
- ***Can result in abrupt airway obstruction*** [1] — this is the **most immediately life-threatening** complication of CEA. The neck is a confined space; an expanding haematoma compresses the trachea and cannot be absorbed quickly enough.
- **Presentation**: Rapidly expanding neck swelling, stridor, dyspnoea, desaturation, agitation.
- **Management**: This is a **surgical emergency** — the wound must be re-opened immediately (sometimes at the bedside before even reaching the operating theatre) to evacuate the haematoma and achieve haemostasis. Intubation may be extremely difficult due to tracheal deviation and airway oedema.
- **Prevention**: Meticulous surgical haemostasis, **strict post-operative BP control** (hypertension strains the suture line), reversal of heparin with protamine if indicated.

#### 2.7 Wound Infection and Parotitis

- ***Surgical wound infection and parotitis can occur following manipulation of the parotid gland during the procedure*** [1].
- The parotid gland lies near the upper extent of the CEA incision. Retraction or direct trauma to the gland can cause inflammation (parotitis) or create a nidus for infection.
- Management: Antibiotics (prophylactic antibiotics are given pre-operatively to mitigate this risk, especially because ***prosthetic material*** (patch) is frequently used [1]). Parotitis may require drainage if an abscess forms.

#### 2.8 Haemodynamic Instability (Post-Operative)

- ***BP lability is common 12–24 hours post-operatively*** [1].
- **Mechanism**: The carotid baroreceptors have been surgically disrupted. Normally, they provide continuous feedback to the brainstem to regulate BP. After CEA, this feedback loop is impaired:
  - **Hypertension**: Baroreceptors are damaged or desensitised → brain "thinks" BP is low → sympathetic drive increases → BP rises.
  - **Hypotension**: Paradoxically, some patients develop hypotension — possibly from baroreceptor over-stimulation (especially after stent deployment in CAS) or from vagal activation.
- **Management**: ***BP is maintained between 100–150 mmHg***. ***Standard of care is arterial line monitoring*** [1]. IV agents (labetalol for hypertension, fluids ± vasopressors for hypotension).

### 3. Complications of Treatment — Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)

CAS shares several complications with CEA (stroke, hyperperfusion syndrome, MI) but also has unique endovascular-specific complications:

#### 3.1 Perioperative Stroke

- ***Short-term periprocedural risk of stroke and death is higher in CAS than CEA, whereas long-term outcomes are similar*** [1].
- **Mechanism**: ***Result of thromboembolism, hypoperfusion due to bradycardia or baroreceptor stimulation, cerebral hyperperfusion, intracerebral haemorrhage*** [1].
- The embolic risk during CAS is higher because the catheter, guidewire, and balloon/stent physically traverse and manipulate the plaque — every contact point risks dislodging debris. **Embolic protection devices** (distal filters or proximal occlusion balloons) reduce but do not eliminate this risk.

#### 3.2 Baroreceptor-Mediated Bradycardia and Hypotension

- **Mechanism**: Balloon inflation and stent deployment at the carotid bulb mechanically stretch the baroreceptors → massive vagal activation → bradycardia → hypotension. This was explained in detail in the management section.
- ***Reaction is usually transient and may require administration of atropine*** [1].
- In some patients, haemodynamic depression persists for 24–48 hours post-procedure, requiring vasopressor support or temporary pacing.

#### 3.3 Hyperperfusion Syndrome

- Identical mechanism to post-CEA hyperperfusion (see Section 2.2 above) [1].
- Same risk factors, presentation, prevention, and management.

#### 3.4 Contrast-Related Complications

- ***Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN)***: ***Renal dysfunction can also be due to renal atheroemboli or renal hypoperfusion in patients with haemodynamic instability*** [1]. CIN is defined as a rise in serum creatinine > 25% or > 44 μmol/L within 48–72 hours of contrast administration.
- **Risk factors**: Pre-existing chronic kidney disease, diabetes, dehydration, large contrast volume.
- **Prevention**: Pre-procedural hydration (IV normal saline), minimise contrast volume, withhold metformin 48 hours post-procedure (risk of lactic acidosis if renal function deteriorates).
- **Contrast allergy**: Anaphylactoid reactions (urticaria, bronchospasm, hypotension). Patients with known contrast allergy require pre-medication (corticosteroids + antihistamines).

#### 3.5 Access-Related Complications

These are common to all endovascular procedures performed via the femoral artery [1]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Bleeding or haematoma*** | Arterial puncture site fails to seal properly. Compounded by anticoagulation (heparin) and DAPT |
| ***Pseudoaneurysm*** | Incomplete sealing of the arterial wall defect → blood tracks into surrounding tissue forming a pulsatile, contained haematoma with a communicating neck to the artery |
| ***Peripheral embolisation*** | Catheter manipulation dislodges aortic, iliac, or femoral plaque → distal limb ischaemia (trash foot / blue toe syndrome) |

#### 3.6 Stent-Related Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| ***Stent fracture*** | Repeated mechanical stress from neck movement can cause fatigue fracture of the stent struts. Rare but can lead to restenosis or vessel injury [1] |
| ***Stent restenosis (in-stent restenosis)*** | Neointimal hyperplasia within the stent → progressive re-narrowing. Detected on surveillance duplex. Managed with repeat balloon angioplasty ± drug-eluting balloon [1] |
| **Stent thrombosis** | Acute thrombotic occlusion of the stent. Prevented by DAPT (aspirin + clopidogrel for 3 months) [2] |

### 4. Comparison of Complications — CEA vs CAS

| Complication | CEA | CAS |
|---|---|---|
| **Perioperative stroke** | Lower | ***Higher*** (short-term) [1] |
| **MI** | Higher (haemodynamic stress, GA) | Lower |
| **Cranial nerve injury** | Yes (CN VII, IX, X, XII, sympathetics) | No (no surgical dissection) |
| **Cervical haematoma / airway compromise** | Yes | No |
| **Wound infection / parotitis** | Yes | No |
| **Contrast nephropathy** | No | Yes |
| **Access-site complications** | No | Yes (femoral haematoma, pseudoaneurysm, embolisation) |
| **Baroreceptor-mediated bradycardia** | Less pronounced | More pronounced (direct stent expansion at carotid sinus) |
| **Hyperperfusion syndrome** | Yes | Yes (similar incidence) |
| **Restenosis** | 2–10% at 5 years | Similar |
| **Long-term outcomes** | ***Similar*** [1] | ***Similar*** [1] |

### 5. Complications of Medical Therapy

Even best medical therapy carries risks:

| Drug | Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Aspirin / Clopidogrel** | GI bleeding, haemorrhagic stroke | Impaired platelet aggregation → reduced haemostasis → bleeding from mucosal erosions or cerebral small vessel disease |
| **Statins** | Myalgia, rhabdomyolysis (rare), hepatotoxicity, new-onset diabetes | Myopathy from impaired mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle (statin-related CoQ10 depletion). Hepatotoxicity from idiosyncratic drug reaction. Diabetes from impaired insulin secretion |
| **Antihypertensives (ACEI)** | Dry cough, hyperkalaemia, angioedema, first-dose hypotension | Cough from accumulated bradykinin (ACEI blocks its degradation). Hyperkalaemia from reduced aldosterone secretion |
| **Anticoagulants (if AF coexists)** | Major bleeding, intracranial haemorrhage | Impaired coagulation cascade (warfarin: vitamin K antagonism; NOACs: direct factor Xa or thrombin inhibition) |
