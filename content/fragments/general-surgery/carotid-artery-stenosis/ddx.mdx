## Differential Diagnosis of Carotid Artery Stenosis

When a patient presents with symptoms in the carotid territory — transient or permanent focal neurological deficits, amaurosis fugax, or a carotid bruit is found — the question is: **is this actually carotid atherosclerotic stenosis, or is something else mimicking it?**

The differential diagnosis operates at two levels:
1. **Other causes of carotid artery narrowing** (i.e., the stenosis is real but the aetiology is not atherosclerosis).
2. **Other conditions that mimic carotid territory symptoms** (i.e., the patient has focal neurological deficits or visual loss, but the cause is not carotid stenosis at all).

Let's work through both systematically.

### 1. Other Causes of Carotid Artery Narrowing (Non-Atherosclerotic Carotid Disease)

These conditions produce genuine ICA stenosis or occlusion but through a completely different pathological process than atherosclerosis. Recognising them is critical because they occur in **different demographics** (often younger patients without cardiovascular risk factors) and require **different management**.

| Condition | Mechanism | Key Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|---|
| ***Carotid artery dissection*** | Tear in the intima → intramural haematoma → luminal narrowing or occlusion. ***Ischaemia from arterial occlusion or embolism*** [4]. | ***Spontaneous — connective tissue disorder. Traumatic — fall, sports, chiropractic.*** ***ICA — retroorbital pain, Horner's syndrome*** (disruption of the sympathetic plexus running along the ICA) [4]. Young or middle-aged patient. History of trauma (even minor — chiropractic manipulation, sports). ***Anticoagulation if no bleeding*** [4]. May form a ***dissecting aneurysm that can rupture and cause SAH intracranially*** [4]. |
| ***Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)*** | Non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic disorder → alternating stenosis and dilation of the arterial wall due to abnormal fibrous and muscular tissue in the vessel wall [1]. | "String of beads" appearance on angiography. Young to middle-aged **women**. No cardiovascular risk factors. Can also cause dissection or aneurysm. Often bilateral. |
| **Vasculitis** — ***Takayasu arteritis*** | Large-vessel granulomatous vasculitis → intimal fibrosis and stenosis of the aorta and its major branches (including CCA and subclavian arteries) [1]. | Young Asian women ( < 40 years). Constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, weight loss). Absent pulses ("pulseless disease"). Raised inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP). |
| **Vasculitis** — ***Giant cell (temporal) arteritis*** | Large-vessel vasculitis → granulomatous inflammation of medium/large arteries. Can affect extracranial carotid branches and vertebral arteries [1]. | Age > 50. Headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, visual loss (anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy). Associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. ESR markedly raised. Temporal artery biopsy diagnostic. |
| **Radiation-induced stenosis** | Accelerated atherosclerosis and fibrosis in irradiated arterial segments. Direct endothelial damage + chronic inflammation → premature plaque formation. | History of head/neck radiation (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma — very relevant in Hong Kong). Onset years to decades after treatment. The "woody fibrosis" of surrounding tissues makes CEA difficult → CAS often preferred [1]. |
| ***Moyamoya disease*** | ***Congenital ICA stenosis*** with ***compensatory proliferation of vascular collaterals ("puff of smoke")*** [4]. Progressive stenosis/occlusion of terminal ICA and proximal Circle of Willis vessels. | ***Young — ischaemic symptoms. Older — bleeding (fragile collaterals).*** [4] More common in East Asian populations (including Hong Kong). Bilateral ICA involvement. Characteristic angiographic appearance. ***Revascularisation surgery might help*** [4]. |
| **Carotid body tumour (paraganglioma)** | Tumour of the chemoreceptor tissue at the carotid bifurcation → external compression and encasement of the carotid artery rather than intrinsic stenosis. | Pulsatile neck mass at the angle of the jaw. Transmitted pulsation. Moves side-to-side but not up-and-down (Fontaine sign). Usually does not cause TIA/stroke unless very large. |

<Callout title="Hong Kong Relevance" type="idea">
In Hong Kong, two non-atherosclerotic causes deserve special attention:
- **Radiation-induced carotid stenosis** — nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in southern China / Hong Kong, and head/neck radiotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. These patients develop accelerated carotid atherosclerosis 5–20 years post-radiation.
- ***Moyamoya disease*** — more prevalent in East Asian (including Chinese) populations. Always consider in a young patient with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke without typical cardiovascular risk factors.

### 2. Conditions That Mimic Carotid Territory Symptoms (Stroke Mimics)

A patient presenting with acute focal neurological deficit may not have carotid stenosis or even a stroke at all. The differential for **acute focal neurological symptoms** is broad. The mnemonic below helps structure the approach:

#### Organised by Category [1]

| Category | Condition | Why It Mimics Carotid Stenosis | How to Distinguish |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Vascular** | ***Cardioembolism*** (AF, valvular disease, MI with mural thrombus) | Emboli from the heart lodge in the same intracranial vessels (MCA, ACA) as emboli from the carotid, producing identical neurological deficits [4][1]. | ECG showing AF/flutter, echocardiogram showing valvular disease or mural thrombus, recent MI. Carotid imaging shows no significant stenosis. This is the **most important differential** — the treatment is anticoagulation, not carotid revascularisation. |
| **Vascular** | ***Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD)*** | Stenosis of the intracranial ICA, MCA, or other intracranial vessels produces identical territory symptoms. Particularly important in **Asian populations** where ICAD is more prevalent than extracranial carotid disease. | CTA/MRA showing intracranial stenosis with normal or mild extracranial disease. Managed medically (dual antiplatelet therapy ± intracranial stenting in selected cases). |
| **Vascular** | **Intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH)** | Sudden hemiparesis, aphasia, or other focal deficits can be identical to ischaemic stroke in the hyperacute phase. | ***Urgent non-contrast CT brain*** [2] — haemorrhage appears as a hyperdense (bright white) lesion. Management is completely different (BP control, reversal of anticoagulation, possible surgery). |
| **Vascular** | **Subdural haematoma** | Gradual onset hemiparesis, confusion, headache. Can mimic a slowly progressive or fluctuating stroke [1]. | History of trauma (may be trivial, especially in elderly on anticoagulants). CT shows crescent-shaped extra-axial collection. |
| **Vascular** | ***Aortic dissection*** | Type A dissection can propagate into the CCA/ICA → acute carotid occlusion → stroke. Presents with ***focal neurological deficits*** from propagation of dissection involving brachiocephalic arteries [6]. | ***Acute tearing chest/back pain***, pulse deficits, BP differential between arms. CT aortogram diagnostic. This is a surgical emergency — stroke treatment alone misses the underlying catastrophe. |
| **Infection** | **Brain abscess** | Space-occupying lesion causing focal deficits, headache, and possibly seizures [1]. | Subacute course (days to weeks). Fever, raised inflammatory markers. CT/MRI shows ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding oedema. |
| **Infection** | **Encephalitis** (viral, autoimmune) | Can cause focal deficits, altered consciousness, seizures [1]. | Fever, altered behaviour preceding focal signs. CSF analysis (lymphocytic pleocytosis). MRI shows temporal lobe involvement (in HSV encephalitis). |
| **Neoplastic** | **Brain tumour** (primary or metastatic) | Slowly progressive focal deficit. Occasionally sudden onset if tumour haemorrhages or causes a seizure [1]. | Subacute/chronic course. Headache worse in morning, progressive. CT/MRI shows mass lesion with enhancement ± surrounding oedema. |
| **Degenerative** | **Multiple sclerosis** | Acute demyelinating episode can cause sudden-onset focal neurological deficit resembling stroke [1]. | Young patient. History of prior episodes with different neurological territories (dissemination in time and space). MRI shows periventricular white matter lesions. CSF shows oligoclonal bands. |
| **Metabolic** | ***Hypoglycaemia*** | Neuroglycopenia can cause focal neurological deficits (hemiparesis, aphasia) that perfectly mimic stroke [1]. | **Always check blood glucose** — this is the most important bedside test before anything else. Immediate resolution with glucose administration. History of diabetes, insulin, or oral hypoglycaemics [1]. |
| **Epileptic** | **Seizure with Todd's paralysis** | A seizure (which may be unwitnessed) can be followed by post-ictal focal weakness (Todd's paralysis) lasting minutes to hours, mimicking stroke [1]. | History of epilepsy, witnessed seizure activity, tongue bite, incontinence. Resolves spontaneously. EEG may show epileptiform activity. |
| **Other** | **Migraine with aura (hemiplegic migraine)** | Aura can produce transient hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, aphasia, or visual symptoms mimicking TIA [1]. | Gradual onset and "march" of symptoms over 20–60 minutes (unlike the sudden onset of vascular events). Followed by headache. History of similar episodes. Younger patient. |
| **Other** | **Syncope / Presyncope** | Loss of consciousness can be confused with stroke, but syncope is due to global cerebral hypoperfusion, not focal ischaemia. | No focal neurological deficit on recovery. Brief duration. Prodrome (lightheadedness, visual dimming, sweating). Vertigo and syncope are **NOT** generally caused by carotid stenosis [1]. |
| **Other** | **Functional neurological disorder (conversion disorder)** | Non-organic weakness, sensory loss, or visual symptoms. | Inconsistent examination findings (e.g., Hoover's sign, give-way weakness). Normal investigations. Diagnosis of exclusion but positive clinical signs of functional disorder. |

<Callout title="The Big Three Stroke Mimics to Exclude at the Bedside" type="error">
Before attributing focal deficits to carotid stenosis (or any stroke), **immediately exclude**:
1. **Hypoglycaemia** — check fingerprick glucose. Focal deficits from neuroglycopenia are completely reversible with glucose.
2. **Intracranial haemorrhage** — urgent NCCT brain. You cannot distinguish ischaemic from haemorrhagic stroke clinically; CT is mandatory.
3. **Seizure with Todd's paralysis** — ask about seizure history and witness accounts.

Getting any of these wrong leads to potentially fatal mismanagement (e.g., giving thrombolysis to a patient with ICH or hypoglycaemia).
</Callout>

### 3. Differential Diagnosis of a Carotid Bruit

A carotid bruit is often the finding that triggers investigation. But not all bruits indicate carotid stenosis, and not all carotid stenosis produces a bruit [1].

| Cause of Carotid Bruit | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Carotid atherosclerotic stenosis** | The most important cause. Turbulent flow through the narrowed segment. Typically heard when stenosis ≥50–70%. Absent in complete occlusion [1]. |
| **Transmitted cardiac murmur** | Aortic stenosis produces a systolic ejection murmur that radiates to the carotids. Differentiate by listening at the aortic area and noting the murmur character (crescendo-decrescendo). |
| **External carotid artery stenosis** | Less clinically significant than ICA stenosis but can produce a bruit at the bifurcation. |
| **Carotid body tumour** | Tumour at the bifurcation creating turbulence. Palpable pulsatile mass. |
| **High-output states** | Anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy — increased cardiac output causes flow murmurs in otherwise normal vessels. These are typically bilateral and symmetrical. |
| **Cervical venous hum** | Continuous murmur from the internal jugular vein. Abolished by light compression of the IJV or by turning the head. |

---

### 4. Differential Diagnosis of Amaurosis Fugax (Transient Monocular Visual Loss)

This is a specific symptom highly associated with carotid stenosis, but other causes must be considered:

| Cause | Mechanism | Distinguishing Feature |
|---|---|---|
| **Carotid atherosclerotic embolism** | Cholesterol/platelet embolus to retinal artery | Painless, "curtain descending." Hollenhorst plaque on fundoscopy. Ipsilateral carotid bruit. |
| **Giant cell arteritis** | Inflammation of ophthalmic/posterior ciliary arteries → ischaemic optic neuropathy | Age > 50, headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, raised ESR/CRP. Can cause permanent visual loss — an ophthalmic emergency. |
| **Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO)** | Complete occlusion (often embolic) → sudden painless monocular blindness (persistent, not transient) | Cherry-red spot at macula on fundoscopy. If transient, may be retinal TIA from carotid source. |
| **Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)** | Venous outflow obstruction → retinal haemorrhages | "Blood and thunder" fundoscopy (widespread flame-shaped haemorrhages). Gradual onset. Associated with glaucoma, hypertension. |
| **Optic neuritis** | Inflammatory demyelination of optic nerve (e.g., MS) | Painful eye movement (distinguishes from painless carotid embolism). RAPD. Young patient. Often recovers over weeks. |
| **Papilloedema** | Raised ICP → optic disc swelling → transient visual obscurations | Bilateral (unlike the unilateral amaurosis of carotid disease). Provoked by Valsalva or postural changes. |
| **Retinal migraine** | Vasospasm of retinal vasculature during migraine aura | Followed by headache. Recurrent, stereotyped episodes. Young patient. Diagnosis of exclusion. |

### 6. Key Distinguishing Points — Aetiological Categories of Ischaemic Stroke

***Acute ischaemic stroke*** is caused by ***cardioembolism, critical arterial stenosis,*** or ***arterial dissection*** [4]. This three-category framework from the lecture slides is the essential starting point for differential diagnosis:

| Category | Examples | Key Investigation |
|---|---|---|
| ***Cardioembolism*** | AF, valvular disease, MI with mural thrombus, prosthetic valves, infective endocarditis, patent foramen ovale [1][4] | ECG, 24–72 hour Holter monitor, transthoracic ± transoesophageal echocardiography |
| ***Critical arterial stenosis*** | **Extracranial carotid atherosclerosis** (the topic at hand), intracranial atherosclerosis, aortic arch atheroma [1][4] | Carotid duplex USG, CTA, MRA, cerebral angiography |
| ***Arterial dissection*** | Carotid dissection, vertebral artery dissection [4] | CTA or MRA showing intramural haematoma, "flame-shaped" tapering, or double lumen. ***ICA — retroorbital pain, Horner's syndrome. VA — occipital pain and vertebrobasilar symptoms*** [4] |

<Callout title="Don't Forget the Heart">
Approximately **75% of ischaemic strokes are embolic** [1], and a large proportion of those emboli come from the heart, not the carotid. Even when significant carotid stenosis is found, always perform a cardiac workup — patients can have **dual pathology** (e.g., AF + carotid stenosis). The management is different: cardioembolism requires anticoagulation, while carotid stenosis is managed with antiplatelet therapy ± revascularisation.
</Callout>

### 7. Summary Table — Differential Diagnosis of Carotid Artery Stenosis

| Differential | Key Feature That Distinguishes from Atherosclerotic Carotid Stenosis |
|---|---|
| **Cardioembolism** | AF on ECG, valvular disease on echo, normal carotid imaging |
| **Intracranial atherosclerosis** | Intracranial stenosis on CTA/MRA; extracranial carotids normal/mild |
| **Carotid dissection** | Young patient, neck pain/trauma, Horner syndrome, intramural haematoma on imaging |
| **Fibromuscular dysplasia** | Young woman, "string of beads," no CV risk factors |
| **Takayasu arteritis** | Young Asian woman, absent pulses, raised ESR, aortic arch involvement |
| **Giant cell arteritis** | Age > 50, headache, jaw claudication, ESR > 50 |
| **Radiation-induced stenosis** | History of prior head/neck radiation |
| **Moyamoya disease** | Young, bilateral ICA stenosis, "puff of smoke" collaterals |
| **Intracerebral haemorrhage** | Hyperdense lesion on NCCT |
| **Subdural haematoma** | Crescent-shaped extra-axial collection on CT |
| **Brain tumour / abscess** | Mass lesion with enhancement on CT/MRI, subacute course |
| **Hypoglycaemia** | Low blood glucose, rapid reversal with dextrose |
| **Todd's paralysis** | Post-ictal, preceded by seizure, resolves spontaneously |
| **Migraine with aura** | Gradual "march" of symptoms, followed by headache |
| **Aortic dissection** | Tearing chest/back pain, pulse deficits, BP differential |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Differential Diagnosis">

**Three aetiological buckets for ischaemic stroke** (from lecture slides): ***cardioembolism, critical arterial stenosis, arterial dissection***. Carotid stenosis falls under "critical arterial stenosis" — but you must exclude the other two.

**Non-atherosclerotic causes of carotid narrowing**: dissection (trauma/connective tissue disorder, Horner syndrome, retroorbital pain), FMD (young women, string of beads), vasculitis (Takayasu, GCA), radiation-induced stenosis (NPC in HK), Moyamoya (young, East Asian, puff of smoke).

**Top stroke mimics to exclude urgently**: hypoglycaemia (check glucose first), ICH (NCCT brain), Todd's paralysis (seizure history).

**Cardioembolism is the most important differential**: AF, valvular disease, mural thrombus. Always do ECG + echo + Holter even if carotid stenosis is found.

**In Hong Kong**: have a low threshold for considering intracranial atherosclerosis (more common in Asians than Caucasians), radiation-induced carotid stenosis (post-NPC treatment), and Moyamoya disease.
