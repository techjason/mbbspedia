## Complications of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma

Complications of NPC can be organized into three broad categories: **(A) complications of the disease itself** (from tumour progression and metastasis), **(B) complications of treatment** (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, surgery), and **(C) long-term survivorship issues**. Because NPC is treated primarily with radiation-based therapy (not surgery), the treatment complication profile is dominated by **radiation-related toxicity** — and given that many NPC patients are diagnosed young (40–60 years) and achieve long survival, late effects are a major clinical concern.

Let me walk through each systematically, always connecting back to the mechanism.

---

### A. Complications of the Disease (Tumour-Related)

These arise from local invasion, regional spread, and distant metastasis — essentially what happens if the tumour is left untreated or progresses despite treatment.

#### 1. Local Complications (From Primary Tumour Progression)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Cranial nerve palsies (CN III–VI, IX–XII)** | Superior spread through foramen lacerum → cavernous sinus (CN III, IV, V1, V2, VI). Lateral spread through parapharyngeal space → CN IX, X, XI, XII. The nasopharynx sits at the crossroads of these neurovascular structures [2]. CN VI (abducens) is most commonly affected because it has the longest intracranial course and traverses the cavernous sinus |
| **Cavernous sinus syndrome** | Tumour invades the cavernous sinus via foramen lacerum → compression of CN III, IV, V1, V2, VI + internal carotid artery (ICA). Presents as complete ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, periorbital numbness, and potentially Horner syndrome (involvement of sympathetic plexus around ICA) |
| **Eustachian tube obstruction → serous otitis media → conductive hearing loss** | Tumour at the fossa of Rosenmüller compresses or infiltrates the Eustachian tube opening and the tensor/levator veli palatini muscles → failure to equalize middle ear pressure → fluid transudation into the middle ear. Chronic effusion can lead to tympanic membrane retraction and cholesteatoma |
| **Nasal obstruction and epistaxis** | Anterior extension into the nasal cavity → mechanical obstruction of the posterior choana; friable tumour vasculature bleeds easily |
| **Skull base erosion** | Superior extension destroys bone of the clivus, sphenoid sinus floor, or petrous apex. Loss of the bony barrier allows intracranial extension → risk of meningitis, CSF leak (rare), brain compression |
| **Carotid artery encasement** | Lateral extension into the parapharyngeal space can encase or erode the internal carotid artery → risk of **carotid blowout syndrome** (catastrophic haemorrhage) — though this is more commonly a post-treatment complication |
| **Dysphagia and aspiration** | CN IX and X palsy (from parapharyngeal invasion) → pharyngeal motor dysfunction → inability to protect the airway during swallowing → aspiration pneumonia |

#### 2. Regional Complications (From Nodal Disease)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Airway compromise** | Massive bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy can compress the airway externally, though this is rare. Retropharyngeal nodal disease can cause posterior pharyngeal wall bulging → narrowing of the airway. ***Always protect the airway for all H&N cancer*** [3] |
| **Jugular vein compression/thrombosis** | Large level II nodes can compress or invade the internal jugular vein → venous congestion, facial oedema |
| **Brachial plexopathy** | N3 nodes extending below the cricoid (supraclavicular fossa) can involve the brachial plexus → upper limb weakness, pain, paraesthesia |

#### 3. Distant Metastatic Complications

***Common sites of distant metastasis: Bone (75%) / Liver / Lung / Distant lymph nodes*** [2]:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Pathological fractures** | ***Bone metastasis (most common, ~75%)*** [2] — tumour in bone marrow stimulates osteoclast activity → bone destruction → structural weakness → fracture with minimal or no trauma. Commonly affects the spine (compression fractures → spinal cord compression), pelvis, ribs, long bones |
| **Spinal cord compression** | Vertebral body collapse or epidural tumour extension → compression of the spinal cord → neurological emergency. Presents with back pain, lower limb weakness, sensory level, bladder dysfunction. Requires urgent MRI and dexamethasone + RT/surgery |
| **Hepatic failure** | Extensive liver metastasis → replacement of functional hepatocytes → liver failure (jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy). Usually signifies end-stage disease |
| **Respiratory compromise** | Pulmonary metastases → reduced gas exchange area → dyspnoea. Lymphangitis carcinomatosis → diffuse interstitial tumour spread in pulmonary lymphatics → severe dyspnoea |
| **Hypercalcaemia of malignancy** | Bone metastasis + PTHrP secretion → ↑ serum calcium → confusion, polyuria, constipation, cardiac arrhythmias. Medical emergency requiring IV normal saline, bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid), and calcitonin |
| **Bone marrow failure** | Extensive marrow infiltration → pancytopenia → infection risk, anaemia, bleeding |

#### 4. Paraneoplastic Complications

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Dermatomyositis** [2] | NPC is one of the malignancies specifically associated with paraneoplastic dermatomyositis, particularly in Chinese populations. Autoimmune-mediated inflammatory myopathy triggered by tumour antigens that cross-react with muscle proteins. Presents with proximal muscle weakness, heliotrope rash (periorbital violet discolouration), Gottron papules (erythematous plaques over knuckles). May precede, coincide with, or follow NPC diagnosis. Treatment of the underlying NPC can improve the dermatomyositis |

---

### B. Complications of Treatment

This is the high-yield section because NPC patients often survive long-term, and treatment toxicity significantly impacts quality of life.

#### 1. Radiotherapy Complications

Radiotherapy is the backbone of NPC treatment. The nasopharynx's anatomical position means that the radiation field inevitably exposes multiple critical surrounding structures. Complications are classified by timing:

##### Acute Complications (During and Up to 3 Months Post-RT)

| Complication | Mechanism | Pathophysiological Basis |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| ***Mucositis (mouth and throat sores)*** [2] | Radiation damages rapidly dividing mucosal epithelial cells of the oropharynx, oral cavity, and nasopharynx → mucosal breakdown → ulceration → pain, dysphagia, secondary infection (candidiasis, bacterial) | Mucosal epithelium has a turnover of ~5–7 days → highly radiosensitive. Damage outpaces regeneration during the treatment course |
| **Dermatitis** | Radiation damages skin in the treatment field → erythema → dry desquamation → moist desquamation (severe) | Similar to sunburn physiology — radiation-induced free radical damage to basal keratinocytes |
| **Xerostomia (dry mouth)** — begins acutely, becomes chronic | Radiation damages salivary gland acinar cells. Serous acini (parotid gland) are MORE radiosensitive than mucous acini (submandibular/sublingual). Loss of serous saliva → thick, sticky, reduced-volume saliva | The parotid gland is the largest serous salivary gland and lies within or adjacent to the radiation field. IMRT has reduced parotid damage by sparing the contralateral parotid, but some degree of xerostomia is almost universal |
| **Dysgeusia (taste disturbance)** | Radiation damages taste buds (especially on the posterior tongue and soft palate, which are in the field) and reduces salivary flow (saliva is needed to dissolve tastants and deliver them to taste receptors) | Usually partially reversible over months; some permanent loss is common |
| **Odynophagia / Dysphagia** | Pharyngeal mucosal inflammation → oedema → pain on swallowing → difficulty maintaining nutrition. May require nasogastric tube (NGT) or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) during treatment | Weight loss during CRT is a major clinical problem; nutritional support is critical |
| **Myelosuppression** (when concurrent chemotherapy given) | Cisplatin + radiation synergistically suppress bone marrow → neutropenia (infection risk), thrombocytopenia (bleeding), anaemia (fatigue) | Monitor FBC weekly during CRT; hold chemotherapy if severe neutropenia |

##### Subacute Complications (3–12 Months Post-RT)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Lhermitte sign** | Transient demyelination of the posterior columns of the spinal cord (within the radiation field) → electric shock-like sensation radiating down the spine on neck flexion. Self-limiting (resolves over months). NOT a sign of myelopathy |
| **Persistent xerostomia** | Ongoing salivary gland damage. Parotid function may partially recover over 12–24 months with IMRT |

##### Late Complications (> 12 Months Post-RT) — HIGH YIELD

These are the most important complications from an exam and clinical perspective because they are **irreversible**, cumulative, and affect survivors for decades.

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Temporal lobe necrosis (TLN)** | The temporal lobes sit directly above and lateral to the nasopharynx → inevitably receive significant radiation dose. High-dose radiation → white matter vasculopathy (endothelial damage → thrombosis of small vessels → ischaemic necrosis of brain parenchyma). Presents with headache, cognitive decline, personality change, seizures, focal neurological deficits. Diagnosed on MRI (ring-enhancing lesion in temporal lobe, often with surrounding oedema — can mimic brain metastasis or abscess). IMRT has reduced but not eliminated this risk | One of the most devastating late effects. Incidence: ~5% at 10 years with IMRT. Treatment: dexamethasone, bevacizumab (anti-VEGF, reduces peritumoural oedema), hyperbaric oxygen, surgical resection for refractory cases |
| **Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)** | Radiation damages cochlear hair cells (outer hair cells are most vulnerable) and cochlear vasculature → irreversible high-frequency hearing loss. **Additive with cisplatin ototoxicity** — both mechanisms target the cochlea | ***Cisplatin causes ototoxicity*** [2]. Radiation compounds this. Patients may have BOTH conductive loss (from Eustachian tube dysfunction/middle ear effusion) and sensorineural loss (from cochlear damage). Serial audiograms needed. Hearing aids for rehabilitation |
| **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of the mandible** | Radiation damages osteocytes and periosteal blood supply → hypoxic, hypovascular, hypocellular bone → failure of wound healing → avascular necrosis. Triggered by dental extraction or trauma post-RT (irradiated bone cannot mount an adequate healing response) | Pre-RT dental assessment and extraction of hopeless teeth is mandatory. Post-RT extractions carry 5–15% risk of ORN. Management: conservative (antibiotics, HBO), surgical (sequestrectomy, free flap reconstruction for severe cases) |
| **Trismus (restricted mouth opening)** | Radiation fibrosis of masticator muscles (medial/lateral pterygoids, masseter, temporalis) and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) capsule → progressive loss of jaw mobility | Incidence: 25–40%. Preventable with jaw stretching exercises (TheraBite) started during RT and continued indefinitely. Severe trismus ( < 20 mm interincisal distance) significantly impairs eating, dental care, and quality of life |
| **Radiation-induced cranial neuropathy** | Radiation damages the vasa nervorum of cranial nerves within the treatment field → ischaemic neuropathy → delayed CN palsy (most commonly CN IX, X, XI, XII — lower cranial nerves). Presents months to years post-RT | Can cause dysphagia (CN IX, X), aspiration, vocal cord palsy (hoarseness), tongue weakness (CN XII). Distinguished from tumour recurrence by stable imaging and undetectable plasma EBV DNA |
| **Dysphagia / Pharyngeal stenosis** | Radiation fibrosis of pharyngeal constrictor muscles → loss of pharyngeal peristalsis → difficulty swallowing. Progressive stricture formation → narrowing of the pharyngeal lumen | ***Rehabilitation always — swallowing, voice, and hearing*** [18]. Swallowing exercises must start during RT and continue long-term. PEG dependence rate post-CRT is ~5–10% |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Radiation to the neck fields damages thyroid follicular cells → gradual loss of thyroid hormone production → primary hypothyroidism (↑ TSH, ↓ fT4) | Incidence: 20–40% at 5 years. Requires lifelong thyroid function monitoring and levothyroxine replacement |
| **Carotid artery stenosis / Stroke** | Radiation accelerates atherosclerosis in the carotid arteries (radiation-induced endothelial injury → intimal hyperplasia → accelerated plaque formation) → carotid stenosis → increased stroke risk | Onset typically > 5 years post-RT. Annual carotid duplex ultrasound surveillance recommended. Antiplatelet therapy and carotid intervention (endarterectomy/stenting) if significant stenosis |
| **Carotid blowout syndrome (CBS)** | Radiation weakens the arterial wall (adventitial damage, vasa vasorum obliteration) → pseudoaneurysm formation → rupture → catastrophic haemorrhage. Risk increases with re-irradiation, local recurrence, and wound breakdown | Life-threatening emergency. Presents with sentinel bleed (small warning bleed from ear, nose, or mouth) followed by massive haemorrhage. Immediate management: direct pressure, airway protection, emergency angiography with embolisation or stent placement |
| **Nasopharyngeal necrosis / Skull base osteonecrosis** | High-dose radiation to the nasopharynx → mucosal and bone necrosis → crusting, foul-smelling discharge, pain. Can mimic local recurrence on imaging | Distinguished from recurrence by biopsy (necrotic tissue without viable tumour) and undetectable plasma EBV DNA |
| **Secondary malignancy** | Radiation-induced DNA damage in normal tissues within the field → second primary cancer years to decades later (e.g., sarcoma of irradiated field, thyroid cancer, brain tumour) | Risk increases with time. Overall incidence ~1–3% at 20 years. Highlights the importance of long-term surveillance |

#### 2. Chemotherapy Complications

These were covered in the Management section but are summarised here for completeness:

| Agent | Key Complications | Mechanism |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| ***Cisplatin*** [2] | ***Nephrotoxicity*** | Direct tubular cell toxicity; renal Mg²⁺ wasting |
| | ***Ototoxicity*** | Outer hair cell damage in cochlea → irreversible high-frequency SNHL; cumulative and dose-dependent |
| | ***Nausea and vomiting (76–100%)*** | Most emetogenic chemotherapy agent; 5-HT3 receptor stimulation in chemoreceptor trigger zone |
| | **Myelosuppression** | Bone marrow suppression → neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia |
| | **Electrolyte disturbance** | Hypomagnesaemia, hypokalaemia from renal wasting |
| | **Peripheral neuropathy** | Sensory neuropathy (glove-and-stocking distribution) from axonal damage; dose-limiting |
| ***5-Fluorouracil*** [2] | ***Myelosuppression (pancytopenia)*** | Bone marrow cells rapidly dividing → susceptible to antimetabolite effect |
| | ***Stomatitis*** | Oral mucosal cells rapidly dividing → ulceration |
| | ***Diarrhoea*** | GI mucosal cells rapidly dividing → mucosal damage |
| | ***Alopecia*** | Hair follicle matrix cells rapidly dividing → hair loss |
| | **DPD deficiency catastrophe** | Patients lacking dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase cannot metabolize 5-FU → severe/fatal toxicity |
| **Gemcitabine** | Myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity | Nucleoside analogue disrupts DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells |

#### 3. Immunotherapy Complications (Immune-Related Adverse Events — irAEs)

Anti-PD-1 agents (pembrolizumab, camrelizumab, toripalimab) release the immune "brakes" globally, not just against the tumour:

| Organ System | irAE | Mechanism |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Lung** | Immune pneumonitis | T-cell infiltration of lung parenchyma → inflammatory alveolitis → cough, dyspnoea, ground-glass opacities on CT |
| **Liver** | Immune hepatitis | T-cell mediated hepatocyte destruction → ↑ AST/ALT |
| **Colon** | Immune colitis | T-cell infiltration of colonic mucosa → diarrhoea, abdominal pain (mimics IBD) |
| **Thyroid** | Thyroiditis | Destructive thyroiditis → transient thyrotoxicosis → subsequent hypothyroidism (on top of radiation-induced hypothyroidism) |
| **Skin** | Dermatitis, vitiligo | T-cell mediated skin inflammation; vitiligo can actually be a marker of good anti-tumour response |
| **Endocrine** | Hypophysitis, adrenalitis | T-cell infiltration of pituitary or adrenal glands → hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency |
| **Cardiac** | Myocarditis | Rare but potentially fatal; T-cell infiltration of myocardium → fulminant heart failure |

Management of irAEs: Hold immunotherapy, systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone/methylprednisolone), and for refractory cases, additional immunosuppression (infliximab, mycophenolate).

#### 4. Surgical Complications (Salvage Surgery)

Since surgery is only used in the salvage setting (post-RT tissue), complications are significantly higher than in primary surgery:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Carotid blowout** | Post-RT carotid wall is weakened; surgical dissection near the carotid in irradiated tissue further compromises the wall → catastrophic haemorrhage |
| **Wound breakdown / Fistula** | Irradiated tissues have poor vascularity and healing capacity → wound dehiscence, pharyngocutaneous fistula |
| **Cranial nerve injury** | Salvage nasopharyngectomy near the skull base risks injury to CN V, VI, internal carotid, CN IX–XII. Post-RT fibrosis obliterates normal tissue planes → higher injury risk |
| **CSF leak** | Skull base surgery or re-irradiation can breach the dura → CSF rhinorrhoea → risk of meningitis |
| **Aspiration pneumonia** | If CN IX/X already compromised by tumour or prior RT, salvage surgery further impairs pharyngeal function → aspiration |

---

### C. Survivorship and Long-Term Quality of Life

***General principles of H&N cancer management apply*** [18]:
- ***Tumour clearance with long-term survival benefit*** [18]
- ***Organ and function preservation*** [18]
- ***Rehabilitation always — swallowing, voice, and hearing*** [18]

NPC survivors face a unique constellation of long-term challenges:

| Domain | Issues | Management |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Swallowing** | Pharyngeal fibrosis, dysphagia, aspiration risk, PEG dependence | Swallowing exercises (pre-RT through long-term), speech-language pathology, modified diet consistency |
| **Hearing** | Combined conductive (middle ear effusion) + sensorineural (cochlear damage from RT + cisplatin) | Audiological assessment, hearing aids, consideration of myringotomy/grommets for persistent effusion |
| **Speech** | Velopharyngeal insufficiency (radiation damage to soft palate → nasal regurgitation, hypernasal speech), tongue weakness (CN XII neuropathy) | Speech therapy |
| **Dental** | Xerostomia → rampant dental caries (saliva normally buffers acid and remineralizes enamel; without it, teeth decay rapidly), ORN risk | Lifelong fluoride trays, saliva substitutes/sialogogues (pilocarpine), meticulous oral hygiene, avoid post-RT dental extractions if possible |
| **Endocrine** | Hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism (if pituitary in field) | Regular thyroid function tests, pituitary hormone panels if symptomatic |
| **Neurocognitive** | Temporal lobe necrosis → memory impairment, personality change, seizures | Neuropsychological assessment, dexamethasone, bevacizumab, antiepileptics |
| **Psychological** | Depression, anxiety, body image issues, fear of recurrence | Psycho-oncology support, patient support groups |
| **Cardiovascular** | Accelerated carotid atherosclerosis → stroke risk | Cardiovascular risk factor management, carotid surveillance |

<Callout title="The NPC Survivor Clinic Checklist" type="idea">
At every follow-up visit for an NPC survivor, systematically assess:
1. **Recurrence** → plasma EBV DNA, clinical examination, nasopharyngoscopy
2. **Swallowing** → can they eat? Aspiration risk?
3. **Hearing** → audiometry
4. **Thyroid** → TSH, fT4
5. **Dental** → oral examination, fluoride compliance
6. **Neurological** → cranial nerves, cognition, temporal lobe symptoms
7. **Vascular** → carotid surveillance if > 5 years post-RT
8. **Psychological** → mood screening
</Callout>

### D. Complications by Disease Recurrence

| Scenario | Complication | Management |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| **Local recurrence** | Re-treatment carries very high toxicity (temporal lobe necrosis, carotid blowout from re-irradiation). Nasopharyngeal necrosis. Skull base osteonecrosis | ***Surgery (open maxillary swing, endoscopic or robotic nasopharyngectomy), chemotherapy, second dose radiotherapy, immunotherapy*** [19] |
| **Regional recurrence** | Re-irradiation toxicity if already treated; surgical salvage in irradiated field has high wound complication rate | ***Neck dissection may be indicated for residual nodal disease following radiotherapy or isolated neck recurrence*** [2] |
| **Distant relapse** | Bone pain, pathological fractures, liver failure, respiratory failure — generally incurable, treatment is palliative | Systemic therapy (GP + anti-PD-1); palliative RT to symptomatic sites; best supportive care |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of NPC">

**Disease complications**: Cranial nerve palsies (CN VI most common), cavernous sinus syndrome, serous otitis media, bone metastasis (75%) with pathological fractures and spinal cord compression, dermatomyositis (paraneoplastic).

**Treatment complications — RT (most important)**:
- **Acute**: mucositis, dermatitis, xerostomia, dysphagia
- **Late (Big Five = TOXIN)**: **T**emporal lobe necrosis, **O**steoradionecrosis of mandible, **X**erostomia (chronic), H**I**pothyroidism, **N**europathy (cranial nerve, SNHL)
- Also: trismus, carotid stenosis/stroke, carotid blowout, pharyngeal stenosis, secondary malignancy

**Treatment complications — Chemotherapy**: Cisplatin = nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, severe emesis. 5-FU = myelosuppression, mucositis, diarrhoea, DPD deficiency risk.

**Treatment complications — Immunotherapy**: irAEs (pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, thyroiditis, myocarditis).

**Survivorship**: Lifelong monitoring of hearing, thyroid, dental health, swallowing, cognition, carotid vasculature, and psychological well-being. Rehabilitation always — swallowing, voice, hearing.

**Pre-RT dental assessment is mandatory** — post-RT dental extraction risks osteoradionecrosis.

</Callout>

      question: "What is temporal lobe necrosis, why does it occur after NPC treatment, and how is it diagnosed and managed?",
      markscheme: "Temporal lobe necrosis is radiation-induced white matter necrosis of the temporal lobes. It occurs because the temporal lobes sit directly above and lateral to the nasopharynx and inevitably receive significant radiation dose. High-dose radiation causes small vessel endothelial damage, thrombosis, and ischaemic necrosis. Diagnosed on MRI as ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding oedema in the temporal lobe (must distinguish from brain metastasis or recurrence with plasma EBV DNA and biopsy if needed). Management: dexamethasone, bevacizumab (anti-VEGF, reduces peritumoural oedema), hyperbaric oxygen, surgical resection for refractory cases."
    },
    {
      question: "Why must all NPC patients have a comprehensive dental assessment BEFORE starting radiotherapy?",
      markscheme: "Because radiotherapy damages osteocytes and the periosteal blood supply of the mandible, creating hypoxic, hypovascular, hypocellular bone. If dental extraction is performed AFTER RT, the irradiated bone cannot mount an adequate healing response, leading to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) with a 5-15% risk. Therefore, all hopeless teeth must be extracted before RT begins to avoid this complication. Post-RT patients need lifelong fluoride trays and meticulous oral hygiene."
    },
    {
      question: "Explain the mechanism of sensorineural hearing loss in NPC patients. Why is it often bilateral and multifactorial?",
      markscheme: "SNHL results from two synergistic mechanisms: (1) Radiation damages cochlear hair cells (especially outer hair cells) and cochlear vasculature leading to irreversible high-frequency hearing loss; (2) Cisplatin is directly ototoxic, also targeting outer hair cells in a dose-dependent, cumulative manner. Both cochleae are in the radiation field (bilateral neck irradiation is always given for NPC). Additionally, patients may also have conductive hearing loss from Eustachian tube dysfunction/middle ear effusion. The combined effect can be devastating."
    },
    {
      question: "A patient treated for NPC 7 years ago presents with a small warning bleed from the nose. What is the feared diagnosis and what is the immediate management?",
      markscheme: "Feared diagnosis: Carotid blowout syndrome (CBS). Post-RT carotid wall weakening leads to pseudoaneurysm formation. A sentinel bleed (small warning bleed) may precede catastrophic haemorrhage. Immediate management: (1) Apply direct pressure/anterior nasal packing, (2) Protect airway, (3) Large-bore IV access and fluid resuscitation, (4) Emergency interventional radiology for angiography with embolisation or covered stent placement. This is a life-threatening emergency."
    },
    {
      question: "Name five organs/systems that require long-term surveillance in NPC survivors and explain why for each.",
      markscheme: "(1) Thyroid - RT causes hypothyroidism in 20-40%; monitor TSH/fT4 and replace with levothyroxine. (2) Hearing - RT plus cisplatin cause SNHL; serial audiometry and hearing aids. (3) Dental - xerostomia causes rampant caries; lifelong fluoride trays, avoid post-RT extractions. (4) Carotid arteries - RT accelerates atherosclerosis causing stroke risk after 5+ years; duplex ultrasound surveillance. (5) Brain (temporal lobes) - temporal lobe necrosis can present years later with cognitive decline, seizures; MRI surveillance."
