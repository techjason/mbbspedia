# Salivary Gland Tumours

## I. Definition

Salivary gland tumours are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms arising from the parenchymal (epithelial) or stromal cells of the major or minor salivary glands. The term itself is descriptive:
- "Salivary" = pertaining to saliva-producing glands
- "Gland" = an organ that produces and secretes substances
- "Tumour" = from Latin *tumor* meaning "swelling" — any abnormal mass of tissue

They encompass a remarkably ***diverse histopathology*** [1] — more than 30 histological subtypes are recognised by the WHO (2022 classification), ranging from indolent benign lesions (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma) to highly aggressive malignancies (e.g., salivary duct carcinoma). This diversity arises because the salivary gland contains multiple cell types (serous acinar cells, mucous acinar cells, myoepithelial cells, ductal cells, basal cells), and tumours can originate from or differentiate towards any of these lineages.

<Callout title="Key Concept">
The single most important clinical principle in salivary gland tumours is the **"inverse relationship rule"**: the smaller the salivary gland, the higher the probability that a neoplasm arising in it is malignant [3]. This reflects the fact that minor salivary glands have less tissue volume — tumours that do arise here tend to be driven by more aggressive biology.

## II. Epidemiology

### General Epidemiology

- ***Salivary gland tumours are relatively uncommon, representing approximately 2% of all head and neck neoplasms*** [1] (some sources quote 6–8% of all H&N cancers [2])
- Annual incidence: approximately 0.4–13.5 per 100,000 population globally, with geographic variation
- ***Male preponderance*** overall for malignant salivary gland tumours [2], though specific subtypes vary:
  - Pleomorphic adenoma: ***F:M = 2:1*** [1]
  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma: ***F > M*** [1]
  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma: ***M = F*** [1]
  - Squamous cell carcinoma: ***M:F = 2:1*** [1]
- ***Predominantly a disease of the elderly (age > 60)*** for malignant tumours [2], though benign tumours peak in the ***4th–6th decades*** [1]
- Age distribution varies by subtype:
  - Pleomorphic adenoma: ***4th–6th decades*** [1]
  - Mucoepidermoid carcinoma: ***3rd–8th decades, peak in 5th decade*** [1]
  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma: ***5th decade*** [1]
  - Squamous cell carcinoma: ***7th–8th decades*** [1]

### Distribution by Gland Site

This is a critical table to memorise — it defines the clinical approach:

| Salivary Gland | % of All Salivary Tumours | % Benign | % Malignant |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Parotid*** | ***80% overall*** | ***80% benign*** | 20–25% |
| ***Submandibular*** | ***15% overall*** | ***50% benign*** | 40–50% |
| ***Sublingual/Minor salivary glands*** | ***5% overall*** | ***40% benign*** | 60% |

[1][2]

> **High Yield**: ***80-80-80 rule for the parotid — 80% of salivary gland tumours occur in the parotid, 80% of parotid tumours are benign, 80% of benign parotid tumours are pleomorphic adenomas*** [1]. This is the single most tested fact.

### Hong Kong Context

- In Hong Kong and Southern China, there is a relatively higher prevalence of **EBV-associated lymphoepithelial carcinoma** of the salivary glands due to the endemic nature of EBV in this population
- Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which is EBV-driven and highly prevalent in Southern China, can metastasise to or be confused with primary salivary gland lesions
- Betel nut chewing, while primarily associated with oral cavity carcinoma, is less common in HK compared to Southeast Asia but still relevant in immigrant populations

## III. Anatomy and Function of the Salivary Glands

Understanding the anatomy is absolutely essential because it dictates surgical approach, explains the pattern of clinical features, and determines the risk of complications (especially facial nerve injury).

### Major Salivary Glands

#### 1. Parotid Gland
- **Largest** salivary gland, weighing ~15–30 g
- Located superficial to the masseter muscle and posterior mandibular ramus, extending from the zygomatic arch superiorly to the angle of the mandible inferiorly
- ***The facial nerve (CN VII) and retromandibular vein divide the parotid gland into superficial (lateral) and deep (medial) lobes*** [2]
  - This is a **surgical plane**, not a true anatomical separation — the gland parenchyma is continuous
  - ***Majority of tumours arise from the superficial lobe*** [2] — this is why superficial parotidectomy is the most common operation
- **Stensen's duct** (parotid duct): exits the anterior border of the gland, crosses the masseter, pierces the buccinator muscle, and opens into the oral cavity opposite the second upper molar
- **Key structures traversing/adjacent to the parotid**:
  - **Facial nerve (CN VII)**: enters the gland posteriorly at the stylomastoid foramen, branches within the gland into the 5 terminal branches (Temporal, Zygomatic, Buccal, Marginal mandibular, Cervical — mnemonic: **T**o **Z**anzibar **B**y **M**otor **C**ar, or **T**wo **Z**ebras **B**it **M**y **C**at)
  - **External carotid artery**: enters the deep surface
  - **Retromandibular vein**: formed within the gland
  - **Auriculotemporal nerve** (branch of V3): provides sensory innervation to the gland; its proximity explains **Frey's syndrome** (gustatory sweating) post-parotidectomy
- **Secretomotor innervation**: Parasympathetic via CN IX (glossopharyngeal) → lesser petrosal nerve → otic ganglion → auriculotemporal nerve → parotid. The parotid produces **serous** (watery) saliva
- **Lymphatics**: The parotid is the **only** salivary gland that contains **intraglandular lymph nodes** (~20 nodes). This is clinically important because:
  - Metastatic disease (e.g., scalp SCC, melanoma) can present as a parotid mass via these intraglandular nodes
  - Lymphoma can present as a parotid mass

#### 2. Submandibular Gland
- Second largest, weighing ~7–15 g
- Located in the submandibular triangle (level I of the neck), wrapping around the posterior border of the mylohyoid muscle into superficial and deep parts
- **Wharton's duct**: runs anteriorly along the floor of the mouth, opens at the sublingual papilla (caruncle) lateral to the lingual frenulum
- Key adjacent structures:
  - **Lingual nerve** (branch of V3): loops under Wharton's duct (mnemonic: "the lingual nerve took a curve around the Wharton's duct" — important surgical landmark)
  - **Marginal mandibular branch of CN VII**: runs superficial to the gland — at risk during submandibular gland excision
  - **Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII)**: deep to the gland
- Produces **mixed** (serous and mucous) saliva; the mucous component makes the saliva more viscous, predisposing to **sialolithiasis** (80% of salivary stones occur here — because the secretion is thicker and Wharton's duct is longer and runs against gravity)

#### 3. Sublingual Gland
- Smallest major salivary gland, weighing ~3–4 g
- Located in the floor of the mouth beneath the mucosa, superior to the mylohyoid
- Drains via multiple small ducts (ducts of Rivinus) directly into the floor of the mouth; some converge to form Bartholin's duct which joins Wharton's duct
- Produces predominantly **mucous** saliva
- Tumours here are **uncommon** but carry a **high malignancy rate (60–90%)** [2]

### Minor Salivary Glands
- ***600–1000 small glands*** distributed throughout the submucosa of the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, trachea, and paranasal sinuses [2]
- ***Most common sites: hard palate, lips, tonsils*** [2]
- Produce predominantly mucous saliva
- No capsule → tumours here tend to be less well-defined and have a **higher malignancy rate (50–75%)** [2]

### Function of Saliva
Understanding saliva function explains why salivary gland surgery/radiotherapy causes morbidity:
- **Lubrication and protection** of oral mucosa
- **Digestion** (amylase, lipase)
- **Antimicrobial** (IgA, lysozyme, lactoferrin)
- **Buffering** (bicarbonate maintains oral pH)
- **Remineralisation** of teeth (calcium, phosphate)
- Total daily production: ~1–1.5 L/day; 60–65% from submandibular, 20–25% from parotid, 7–8% from sublingual, remainder from minor glands

## IV. Etiology and Risk Factors

Most salivary gland tumours have **no clearly identified cause** — this contrasts with many other H&N cancers where smoking and alcohol are dominant drivers. However, several risk factors have been identified:

### 1. Viral Infections

#### ***Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)*** [2]
- ***Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the salivary gland is associated with EBV in endemic areas*** [2] — this is particularly relevant in **Hong Kong and Southern China**
- Pathophysiology: EBV infects epithelial cells and drives oncogenesis through latent membrane proteins (LMP1, LMP2A) that activate NF-κB and PI3K/AKT pathways, promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis
- The tumour has a characteristic histology: sheets of undifferentiated carcinoma cells interspersed with a dense lymphoid stroma (similar to undifferentiated NPC, which is also EBV-driven)

#### ***Human Papillomavirus (HPV)*** [2]
- ***High-risk HPV serotypes (especially HPV 16) are occasionally detected in mucoepidermoid carcinoma*** [2]
- Pathophysiology: HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 inactivate tumour suppressors p53 and Rb respectively → unchecked cell cycle progression
- The association is less strong than HPV's role in oropharyngeal SCC

#### ***HIV*** [2]
- ***Increased incidence of salivary gland tumours reported in HIV patients*** [2]
- Particularly benign lymphoepithelial cysts and lymphoepithelial carcinoma
- Mechanism: immune dysregulation and chronic lymphocyte stimulation within salivary glands → lymphoid hyperplasia → potential neoplastic transformation

### 2. ***Radiation Exposure*** [2]

- ***Increased risk in long-term cancer survivors who received radiotherapy as part of their treatment, particularly for Hodgkin lymphoma*** [2]
- ***Increased risk in individuals who received radiation to the H&N region for childhood cancer or other benign conditions*** [2]
- Pathophysiology: Ionising radiation causes DNA double-strand breaks → if misrepaired, leads to chromosomal translocations and oncogene activation. There is typically a long latency period (10–30 years)
- ***Previous irradiation/malignancy*** is also listed as a general risk factor for H&N cancers [4]

### 3. ***Smoking*** [2]

- ***Warthin's tumour is STRONGLY associated with smoking, in contrast to other salivary gland tumours for which there is no clear relationship*** [2]
- The mechanism is not entirely understood, but hypotheses include:
  - Smoking causes chronic irritation and metaplasia of salivary duct epithelium
  - Smoking promotes lymphoid hyperplasia within the parotid (Warthin's tumour characteristically has a prominent lymphoid stroma)
  - Smokers have an **8-fold increased risk** of developing Warthin's tumour
- Note: Unlike most other H&N cancers, ***smoking is NOT a major risk factor for most salivary gland tumours*** — this is a commonly tested distinction

<Callout title="Exam Pitfall" type="error">
Students often assume smoking is a risk factor for all salivary gland tumours because it is a risk factor for most H&N cancers. Remember: ***smoking is specifically associated with Warthin's tumour*** but NOT with pleomorphic adenoma or most malignant salivary gland tumours [2].
</Callout>

### 4. Occupational/Environmental Exposures
- Nickel, silica dust, and rubber manufacturing have been linked in some studies
- UV light exposure — relevant for skin SCC that metastasises to parotid intraglandular lymph nodes

### 5. Genetic Factors
- Specific chromosomal translocations are identified in certain subtypes:
  - **Pleomorphic adenoma**: rearrangements involving *PLAG1* (8q12) or *HMGA2* (12q14-15) — these transcription factors drive the mixed epithelial-mesenchymal differentiation pattern
  - **Mucoepidermoid carcinoma**: *MAML2* rearrangement (t(11;19)(q21;p13)) creating CRTC1-MAML2 fusion — activates Notch signalling. Present in ~55% of cases and associated with **favourable prognosis**
  - **Adenoid cystic carcinoma**: *MYB-NFIB* fusion (t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24)) — MYB is a transcription factor driving cell proliferation. This fusion is found in ~60–80% of cases and is considered a hallmark
  - **Secretory carcinoma** (previously mammary analogue secretory carcinoma): *ETV6-NTRK3* fusion — identical to the translocation seen in secretory carcinoma of the breast

---

## V. Pathophysiology

### Cellular Origins

Salivary gland tumours arise from the **intercalated duct reserve cells** (stem/progenitor cells) that have the capacity to differentiate into both luminal (ductal/acinar) and abluminal (myoepithelial/basal) cell types. This explains the remarkable histological diversity:

- Tumours differentiating towards **luminal cells** → acinic cell carcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma
- Tumours differentiating towards **myoepithelial cells** → myoepithelioma
- Tumours differentiating towards **both** → pleomorphic adenoma (hence "pleomorphic" = many forms — it contains epithelial and mesenchymal-like elements, including myxoid, chondroid, and osseous stroma)

### Why Is the Parotid the Most Common Site?

Simply because it is the **largest** salivary gland with the most tissue mass → more cells → more opportunity for neoplastic transformation. Additionally, it contains intraglandular lymph nodes that can harbour metastatic disease.

### Why Are Smaller Glands More Likely to Have Malignant Tumours?

This is not entirely understood but likely reflects:
1. **Selection bias**: benign tumours in small glands may be too small to present clinically → the ones that do present are more likely to be malignant (growing faster)
2. **Microenvironment differences**: minor salivary glands lack a capsule → less physical constraint on growth → malignant behaviour may be more easily established
3. **Different stem cell populations**: the progenitor cell pool in minor glands may have different susceptibility to malignant transformation

### Patterns of Spread

Understanding how salivary gland cancers spread explains staging and surgical approach:

1. **Local invasion**:
   - Through the gland capsule (or pseudocapsule in pleomorphic adenoma)
   - Into adjacent structures: skin, mandible, masseter, pterygoid muscles, external auditory canal, temporal bone
   - **Perineural invasion** — particularly characteristic of ***adenoid cystic carcinoma*** [1][2] — tumour cells track along nerve sheaths, sometimes far from the primary tumour. This causes **pain, paraesthesia, and facial nerve palsy** and is the main reason adenoid cystic carcinoma has such high local recurrence rates

2. ***Lymph node metastasis*** [2]:
   | Primary Site | First Echelon Nodes |
   |---|---|
   | ***Parotid gland*** | ***Intraparotid nodes → Level I & II cervical nodes*** |
   | ***Submandibular gland*** | ***Adjacent perivascular nodes → Cervical nodes*** |
   | ***Sublingual gland*** | ***Submental and submandibular nodes*** |
   | ***Minor salivary glands*** | ***Retropharyngeal nodes*** |

3. ***Distant metastasis*** [2]:
   - ***Lung*** (most common site)
   - ***Bone***
   - ***Liver***
   - Adenoid cystic carcinoma is particularly notorious for **haematogenous** distant metastasis (especially to lungs), even in the absence of lymph node involvement — this is because it preferentially invades blood vessels and perineural spaces rather than lymphatics

## VI. Classification

### WHO Classification of Salivary Gland Tumours (2022, 5th Edition)

The WHO classifies > 30 histological subtypes. The clinically most important ones are:

#### A. Benign Tumours

| Tumour | Key Features |
|---|---|
| **Pleomorphic adenoma** | ***Most common of ALL salivary gland neoplasms*** [1] |
| **Warthin's tumour** (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum) | 2nd most common benign; ***strongly associated with smoking*** [2] |
| **Basal cell adenoma** | Well-circumscribed; typically parotid |
| **Canalicular adenoma** | Almost exclusively in upper lip minor salivary glands |
| **Myoepithelioma** | Pure myoepithelial differentiation |
| **Oncocytoma** | Composed of oncocytes (mitochondria-rich cells) |

#### B. Malignant Tumours

| Tumour | Key Features |
|---|---|
| **Mucoepidermoid carcinoma** | ***Most common salivary gland malignancy*** [1][2] |
| **Adenoid cystic carcinoma** | ***2nd most common malignancy overall; most common malignancy of submandibular, sublingual and minor salivary glands*** [1][2] |
| **Acinic cell carcinoma** | ***2nd most common parotid malignancy*** [2]; low-grade |
| **Salivary duct carcinoma** | Aggressive; resembles breast ductal carcinoma; often HER2+ and androgen receptor+ |
| **Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma** | ***Malignant transformation of a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma*** [2] |
| **Adenocarcinoma NOS** | Catch-all for adenocarcinomas not fitting other categories |
| **Squamous cell carcinoma** | ***Rare (1.6%); diagnosis of exclusion*** [1] |
| **Lymphoepithelial carcinoma** | EBV-associated; endemic in Southern China/HK |
| **Secretory carcinoma** | ETV6-NTRK3 fusion; generally low-grade |
| **Polymorphous adenocarcinoma** | Almost exclusively in minor salivary glands (palate) |

### Grading

Salivary gland tumour grading is **subtype-dependent**:
- **Mucoepidermoid carcinoma**: graded as low, intermediate, or high grade (based on proportion of cystic vs solid component, mitotic rate, necrosis, neural invasion, anaplasia)
- **Adenoid cystic carcinoma**: graded by histological pattern — tubular (best prognosis) → cribriform → solid (worst prognosis)
- Many other subtypes are considered inherently low-grade or high-grade (e.g., acinic cell = low-grade; salivary duct carcinoma = high-grade)

---

## VII. Clinical Features

The clinical presentation of salivary gland tumours depends on the gland involved, whether the tumour is benign or malignant, and the specific histological subtype. The fundamental skill is distinguishing benign from malignant disease at the bedside.

### A. Symptoms

#### 1. ***Salivary Gland Mass or Swelling*** [2]
- **The cardinal presenting symptom** — a lump noticed by the patient
- **Benign tumours**: typically ***slow-growing, painless*** mass that has been present for months to years
  - Why painless? Because benign tumours expand by compression, pushing structures aside rather than invading them. The capsule (or pseudocapsule) separates the tumour from sensory nerves
  - Why slow-growing? Because benign tumours have low mitotic rates and retain some growth regulation
- **Malignant tumours**: may be ***rapidly enlarging***, though low-grade malignancies (e.g., low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma) can mimic benign behaviour with slow growth
  - A **change in growth pattern** — particularly ***sudden growth of a previously stable mass*** — is highly suspicious for malignant transformation (***carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma***) [2]
- **Location matters**:
  - Parotid mass: appears as a swelling at the angle of the jaw, pre-auricular region, or below the ear lobule. A deep lobe tumour may present as a **parapharyngeal mass** visible in the oropharynx (pushing the tonsil/soft palate medially) — the so-called "dumbbell" or "iceberg" tumour
  - Submandibular mass: swelling in the submandibular triangle; must distinguish from lymphadenopathy, submandibular gland sialolithiasis, or sialadenitis
  - Minor salivary gland mass: ***submucosal mass*** in the palate (most common), lip, buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, tongue base [2][5]

#### 2. ***Pain and Paraesthesia*** [2]
- **Pain** suggests malignancy in the context of a salivary gland mass, though not all painful lesions are malignant:
  - Why does malignancy cause pain? Because malignant tumours **invade** surrounding tissues including sensory nerve fibres (especially trigeminal V3 branches in the parotid region), causing nociceptive and neuropathic pain
  - ***Adenoid cystic carcinoma*** is particularly associated with pain and paraesthesia due to its ***propensity for perineural invasion*** [1][2] — tumour cells physically grow along nerve sheaths, causing both mechanical compression and demyelination
  - High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma may also present with pain
- **Paraesthesia** (numbness, tingling): indicates neural involvement → high suspicion for malignancy
  - In the parotid region: numbness of the cheek/ear (auriculotemporal nerve, great auricular nerve)
  - In the submandibular region: numbness of the lower lip/chin (mental nerve involvement)
- Benign tumours are **almost always painless**. Exceptions: infection, haemorrhage into a tumour, very large tumours compressing adjacent nerves

#### 3. ***Facial Weakness*** [2]
- **This is the single most important "red flag" symptom** — facial nerve weakness in the presence of a parotid mass is **malignant until proven otherwise**
- Why? Because the facial nerve runs through the substance of the parotid gland. Benign tumours displace the nerve; malignant tumours **invade** the nerve
- ***Parotid tumour must be distinguished from Bell's palsy*** [2] — the key difference is:
  - Bell's palsy: acute onset, no mass, often painful, usually recovers
  - Malignant parotid tumour with CN VII palsy: progressive onset, mass present, usually painless facial weakness, does NOT recover without treatment
- The pattern of weakness helps localise:
  - A single branch affected → tumour near that branch
  - All branches affected → tumour at the main trunk (near stylomastoid foramen) or extensive disease
- ***Presentation with pain, paraesthesia, and facial weakness/paralysis*** is the classic triad of ***adenoid cystic carcinoma*** [1]

#### 4. Dysphagia/Airway Symptoms
- Deep lobe parotid tumours or parapharyngeal space extension may cause:
  - Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) — from compression of the oropharynx
  - Obstructive sleep symptoms
  - Change in voice (hot potato voice) — from pharyngeal compression
- Minor salivary gland tumours of the palate/oropharynx may also cause these symptoms

#### 5. Trismus
- Trismus (inability to open the mouth) suggests invasion of the pterygoid muscles or infratemporal fossa — a sign of **locally advanced malignancy**
- Pathophysiology: tumour invasion causes fibrosis and spasm of the pterygoid muscles or direct infiltration of the temporomandibular joint

#### 6. ***Mucosal Ulceration*** [2]
- Minor salivary gland tumours of the palate or oral cavity may present with ulceration of the overlying mucosa
- Why? Because malignant tumours outgrow their blood supply and directly erode through the mucosal surface
- Also seen in high-grade parotid tumours that invade through the skin

### B. Signs

#### 1. Palpable Mass
- **Benign features**: mobile, well-defined, smooth surface, non-tender, firm/rubbery consistency
  - ***Pleomorphic adenoma***: classically firm, lobulated, non-tender
  - ***Warthin's tumour***: often softer/fluctuant (due to cystic spaces), may be bilateral (***10% bilaterality***) [2]
- **Malignant features**: ***fixed*** to skin or deep structures, hard/stony consistency, irregular/poorly defined margins, tender
  - Fixation occurs because the tumour invades beyond its capsule into surrounding fascia, muscle, or bone

#### 2. ***Facial Nerve Palsy*** (Lower Motor Neuron Pattern)
- ***High suspicion of malignant involvement of the parotid gland*** [2]
- Examination: ask the patient to raise eyebrows, close eyes tightly, puff cheeks, show teeth, whistle
- LMN pattern affects **all ipsilateral branches** (forehead sparing only occurs in UMN lesions)
- Document which specific branches are involved — this affects surgical planning
- Incidence: facial nerve palsy occurs in ~10–15% of parotid malignancies at presentation

#### 3. Skin Changes
- Skin tethering/dimpling: tumour tethered to dermis
- Skin ulceration/fungation: direct invasion through skin — advanced disease
- Erythema/warmth: may suggest inflammatory malignancy or secondary infection

#### 4. Cervical Lymphadenopathy
- Palpable neck nodes suggest metastatic disease
- Systematically examine all cervical node levels (I–V, plus pre-auricular, post-auricular, and occipital)
- Important: palpable intraparotid or periparotid nodes may represent primary lymph node disease (lymphoma) or metastasis from cutaneous malignancy (scalp/face SCC or melanoma)

#### 5. Examination of the Oral Cavity
- ***Minor salivary gland tumours present as submucosal masses*** [3][5]
  - Hard palate: most common location — look for a smooth, dome-shaped submucosal swelling, ± ulceration
  - Tongue base, soft palate, lip, buccal mucosa
- Check for mucosal ulceration, which suggests malignancy

#### 6. Cranial Nerve Examination
- Beyond CN VII, assess:
  - **CN V** (trigeminal): sensory loss in V2/V3 distribution suggests perineural invasion tracking back towards the skull base
  - **CN IX, X, XI, XII**: involvement suggests parapharyngeal space invasion or skull base extension
  - Horner's syndrome (sympathetic chain involvement): ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis — indicates carotid space involvement

#### 7. Deep Lobe Tumour Signs
- Parapharyngeal extension: visible as medial displacement of the soft palate/tonsil on intraoral examination
- The mass is visible in the oropharynx but palpation reveals a connection to the parotid gland externally

### C. Clinical Features by Specific Tumour Type

#### ***Pleomorphic Adenoma*** [1]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frequency | ***Most common of all salivary gland neoplasms; 80% of parotid tumours, 50% of submandibular tumours, 45% of minor salivary gland tumours, 6% of sublingual tumours*** [1] |
| Demographics | ***4th–6th decades; F:M = 2:1*** [1] |
| Presentation | ***Slow-growing, painless mass*** [1] |
| Parotid location | ***90% in superficial lobe, most in tail of gland*** [1] |
| Minor salivary gland | ***Lateral palate, submucosal mass*** [1] |
| Malignant potential | ***Malignant degeneration 10–15% risk in 10 years*** [1] — this is why long-standing pleomorphic adenomas MUST be excised |
| Recurrence | Known for local recurrence if incompletely excised — pseudocapsule has "pseudopods" (satellite nodules) that extend into surrounding tissue. Enucleation alone → ~20–45% recurrence rate. Superficial parotidectomy → < 5% recurrence |

**Pathophysiology of malignant transformation**: Over time, accumulated genetic mutations (p53 loss, HER2 amplification, CDKN2A deletion) in the pleomorphic adenoma cells lead to emergence of a malignant clone. The longer the tumour sits, the higher the risk → ***10–15% at 10 years, up to 25% at 15–20 years***. This is the basis for ***carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma*** [2].

<Callout title="Clinical Pearl" type="idea">
***Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma*** is ***manifested by sudden growth of a previously stable mass in a salivary gland, usually the parotid gland*** [2]. Any patient with a long-standing parotid mass that suddenly starts growing needs urgent investigation. The prognosis ***depends upon the extent of invasion, grade, tumour size, and lymph node status*** [2].
</Callout>

#### ***Warthin's Tumour*** [2]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frequency | ***Accounts for 6–10% of parotid tumours*** [2] |
| Demographics | Males > Females (5:1); 6th–7th decades |
| Association | ***STRONGLY associated with smoking*** [2] |
| Key features | ***Tendency for multifocality and bilaterality (10%)*** [2] — unique among salivary gland tumours |
| Presentation | ***Slow-growing painless mass*** [2]; often soft/fluctuant (cystic component) |
| Malignant potential | Extremely rare (< 1%); essentially a benign tumour |

**Pathophysiology**: Warthin's tumour is thought to arise from salivary duct epithelium trapped within intraparotid lymph nodes during embryological development. The tumour consists of bilayered oncocytic epithelium overlying a lymphoid stroma with germinal centres. The lymphoid component explains the association with smoking (which stimulates lymphoid hyperplasia) and the tendency for bilaterality (multiple lymph nodes can independently develop the tumour).

**Why is Warthin's tumour classically "warm" on Tc-99m pertechnetate scan?** Because the oncocytic cells are metabolically active (packed with mitochondria) and actively concentrate technetium. This is in contrast to most other salivary gland tumours which appear as "cold" spots.

#### ***Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma*** [1][2]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frequency | ***Most common salivary gland malignancy; 5–9% of salivary neoplasms*** [1] |
| Location | ***Parotid in 45–70% of cases*** [1] |
| Demographics | ***3rd–8th decades, peak in 5th decade; F > M*** [1] |
| Low-grade | ***Typically cystic, slow-growing and without pain*** [2] — behaves almost like a benign tumour |
| High-grade | ***Typically solid, rapidly enlarging with or without pain*** [2] — aggressive, with risk of metastasis |
| Molecular | CRTC1-MAML2 fusion → favourable prognosis; absence of fusion → worse outcomes |

**Pathophysiology**: The tumour contains three cell types in varying proportions — mucous cells, epidermoid (squamous) cells, and intermediate cells. Low-grade tumours have more mucous cells (cystic spaces filled with mucin → cystic feel); high-grade tumours have more epidermoid/intermediate cells (solid, aggressive growth).

#### ***Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma*** [1][2]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frequency | ***Overall 2nd most common malignancy; most common in submandibular, sublingual and minor salivary glands*** [1] |
| Demographics | ***M = F; 5th decade*** [1] |
| Presentation | ***Asymptomatic enlarging mass; pain, paraesthesia, facial weakness/paralysis*** [1] |
| Key pathological feature | ***Propensity for perineural invasion and distant metastasis*** [2] |
| Behaviour | ***Locally aggressive with recurrence arising after many years*** [2] — known for very late recurrences (10–20 years post-treatment) |
| Histological patterns | Cribriform (Swiss cheese pattern — most common), tubular, solid |
| Molecular | MYB-NFIB fusion in ~60–80% |

**Pathophysiology of perineural invasion**: Adenoid cystic carcinoma cells express neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) and nerve growth factor receptors that are attracted to nerve growth factors secreted by Schwann cells and perineural fibroblasts. The tumour cells essentially "follow the nerve" like a track, sometimes spreading centimetres away from the primary tumour and even reaching the skull base → this is why:
- Pain is common (nerve compression/invasion)
- Facial palsy occurs (CN VII invasion)
- Complete surgical clearance is extremely difficult (positive margins are common)
- Late local recurrence is the rule (microscopic disease along nerves)

**Distant metastasis pattern**: Uniquely, adenoid cystic carcinoma metastasises **haematogenously** (to lungs primarily) rather than via lymphatics. Patients can live with lung metastases for years due to the indolent growth rate — 5-year survival may appear reasonable but 15-year survival drops dramatically.

#### ***Acinic Cell Carcinoma*** [2]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frequency | ***2nd most common parotid gland malignancy*** [2] |
| Behaviour | ***Exhibits low-grade behaviour and associated with a favourable long-term prognosis*** [2] |
| Demographics | Bimodal: young adults and 5th decade; slight female predominance |
| Histology | Serous acinar differentiation (resembles normal parotid acinar cells) with PAS-positive cytoplasmic granules |

#### ***Squamous Cell Carcinoma*** [1][2]

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Frequency | ***Rare, 1.6% of salivary gland neoplasms*** [1] |
| Demographics | ***7th–8th decades; M:F = 2:1*** [1] |
| Key concept | ***True primary SCC of salivary glands is very rare and is regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion*** [2] |
| ***MUST RULE OUT*** [1] | ***1. High-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma*** (can look like SCC histologically) |
| | ***2. Metastatic SCC to intraglandular lymph nodes, usually from scalp SCC*** |
| | ***3. Direct extension of skin SCC*** |

**Why is this a diagnosis of exclusion?** Because the salivary gland parenchyma does not normally contain squamous epithelium. Any SCC found in the parotid is most likely:
1. A high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma that has lost its mucous component and looks squamoid
2. A metastasis from a cutaneous SCC (scalp, face, ear) that has spread to intraglandular lymph nodes — **very common in Australia and sun-exposed populations**, and also relevant in Hong Kong elderly with sun-damaged skin
3. Direct invasion from an adjacent skin SCC

Only after excluding all three can you call it primary SCC.

## VIII. Summary of Benign vs. Malignant Features

This table summarises the clinical differentiation — **the most important clinical skill**:

| Feature | Benign | Malignant |
|---|---|---|
| Growth rate | Slow (months–years) | Rapid (weeks–months), or sudden acceleration |
| Pain | Absent | Present (especially adenoid cystic) |
| Facial nerve function | Intact | Palsy (10–15% at presentation) |
| Mobility | Mobile | Fixed to skin/deep structures |
| Surface | Smooth, well-defined | Irregular, ill-defined |
| Skin changes | None | Tethering, ulceration, erythema |
| Lymphadenopathy | Absent | Present (suggests metastasis) |
| Consistency | Firm/rubbery (PA) or soft (Warthin's) | Hard/stony |
| Duration before presentation | Long | Often short |

**Key facts to remember for exams:**

1. ***80-80-80 rule***: 80% of salivary tumours are in the parotid; 80% of parotid tumours are benign; 80% of benign parotid tumours are pleomorphic adenomas [1]
2. ***Inverse relationship rule***: smaller gland → higher chance of malignancy [2][3]
3. ***Pleomorphic adenoma***: most common overall; 10–15% malignant degeneration risk at 10 years; recurs if enucleated; arises in superficial lobe (90%); F:M = 2:1 [1]
4. ***Warthin's tumour***: STRONGLY associated with smoking; bilateral in 10%; essentially never turns malignant; oncocytic + lymphoid stroma [2]
5. ***Mucoepidermoid carcinoma***: most common malignancy; graded low/intermediate/high; low-grade = cystic and indolent, high-grade = solid and aggressive [1][2]
6. ***Adenoid cystic carcinoma***: perineural invasion hallmark; haematogenous spread (lungs); very late recurrences (10–20 years); MYB-NFIB fusion; most common malignancy of submandibular/sublingual/minor glands [1][2]
7. ***Facial nerve palsy + parotid mass = malignant until proven otherwise*** [2]
8. ***SCC of salivary gland is a diagnosis of exclusion*** — must rule out high-grade mucoepidermoid, metastatic cutaneous SCC, and direct extension [1]
9. ***Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma*** = sudden growth of a long-standing stable parotid mass [2]
10. ***Smoking is NOT a risk factor for most salivary gland tumours*** — only Warthin's tumour [2]
11. Lymph node drainage: parotid → intraparotid → level I/II; submandibular → perivascular → cervical; sublingual → submental/submandibular; minor → retropharyngeal [2]
12. Distant metastasis: lung > bone > liver [2]

      question: "What is the most important red flag symptom suggesting malignancy in a parotid mass, and why does it occur?",

    },
    {
      question: "Why is Warthin tumour strongly associated with smoking while other salivary gland tumours are not?",
      markscheme: "Warthin tumour has a prominent lymphoid stroma component; smoking stimulates lymphoid hyperplasia within intraparotid lymph nodes. Warthin tumour arises from salivary duct epithelium trapped in these lymph nodes. Other salivary gland tumours do not share this lymphoid-dependent pathogenesis.",

    {
      question: "Name the hallmark pathological feature of adenoid cystic carcinoma and explain why it causes late local recurrence.",
      markscheme: "Perineural invasion. Tumour cells express NCAM and nerve growth factor receptors attracted to Schwann cell growth factors, tracking along nerve sheaths far from the primary tumour. Microscopic disease along nerves persists after surgery, causing recurrence even 10-20 years later.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is primary SCC of the salivary gland considered a diagnosis of exclusion? What three entities must be ruled out?",
      markscheme: "Salivary gland parenchyma does not normally contain squamous epithelium, so SCC is unlikely to arise primarily. Must rule out: (1) high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma mimicking SCC, (2) metastatic cutaneous SCC to intraglandular lymph nodes, (3) direct extension of adjacent skin SCC.",
    },
    {
      question: "A patient with a long-standing stable parotid mass presents with sudden rapid enlargement over 2 months. What is the most likely diagnosis and what determines prognosis?",
      markscheme: "Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Prognosis depends on extent of invasion beyond the capsule, histological grade, tumour size, and lymph node status.",
