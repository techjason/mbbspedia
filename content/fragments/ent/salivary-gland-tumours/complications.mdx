## Complications of Salivary Gland Tumours

Complications in this context fall into two broad categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (untreated tumour) — what happens if salivary gland tumours are left alone or present late
2. **Complications of treatment** (surgery, radiotherapy) — what we cause by treating the tumour

Both are clinically important and frequently tested. The lecture slides specifically highlight ***parotidectomy and related complications*** [1] as a core learning objective.

---

### I. Complications of the Disease (Untreated / Advanced Tumour)

These complications arise from the natural history of salivary gland tumours — particularly malignant ones — if left untreated or if they present late.

#### 1. Facial Nerve Paralysis from Tumour Invasion

- The most devastating consequence of an untreated parotid malignancy
- **Why it happens**: Malignant tumours (especially adenoid cystic carcinoma) invade the facial nerve directly as it traverses the parotid gland. The tumour cells physically infiltrate the nerve sheath, compress and destroy axons, and cause progressive denervation of the facial muscles
- **Clinical consequences**:
  - **Eye**: Inability to close the eye (zygomatic branch) → lagophthalmos → corneal exposure → keratitis → corneal ulceration → potentially **permanent visual loss** if untreated. This is an ophthalmic emergency
  - **Mouth**: Oral incompetence (buccal and marginal mandibular branches) → drooling, food pocketing in the buccal sulcus, difficulty eating and speaking
  - **Cosmesis and psychosocial impact**: Facial asymmetry is profoundly distressing; affects social interaction, self-esteem, and quality of life

#### 2. Perineural Spread to the Skull Base

- ***Adenoid cystic carcinoma has a propensity for perineural invasion*** [2] — tumour cells track along the facial nerve proximally towards the stylomastoid foramen and into the temporal bone, and can reach the **brainstem**
- Can also track along trigeminal nerve branches (V2, V3) into the skull base via the foramen rotundum or foramen ovale
- Results in: intractable neuropathic pain, multiple cranial nerve palsies (CN V, VII, IX, X, XI, XII), and potentially **intracranial disease** that is essentially inoperable

#### 3. Local Invasion of Adjacent Structures

| Structure Invaded | Consequence | Why It Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Skin | Ulceration, fungation, bleeding, secondary infection | Tumour erodes through the dermis; outgrows its blood supply → necrosis |
| Mandible | Pathological fracture, trismus, pain | Direct bony invasion; loss of structural integrity |
| External auditory canal | Ear pain, conductive hearing loss, otorrhoea (discharge) | Deep lobe parotid tumours or adenoid cystic carcinoma tracking along auriculotemporal nerve into the EAC |
| Temporal bone | Intracranial extension, CSF leak, meningitis | Advanced T4b disease with erosion through the tegmen tympani |
| Pterygoid muscles / infratemporal fossa | Trismus (inability to open mouth) | Tumour infiltrates the muscles of mastication → fibrosis and spasm |
| Parapharyngeal space | Dysphagia, airway obstruction, "hot potato" voice | Mass effect on the oropharynx from deep lobe extension |

#### 4. Malignant Transformation of Benign Tumours

- ***Pleomorphic adenoma has a malignant degeneration risk of 10–15% in 10 years*** [1]
- ***Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is manifested by sudden growth of a previously stable mass*** [2]
- Long-standing pleomorphic adenomas that are observed rather than excised carry increasing risk over time (up to 25% at 15–20 years)
- This is a **preventable complication** — the reason we excise all pleomorphic adenomas rather than "watching and waiting"

#### 5. Lymph Node and Distant Metastasis

- Malignant salivary gland tumours metastasise to regional lymph nodes and distant sites (***lung, bone, liver***) [2]
- ***Adenoid cystic carcinoma: distant metastasis common, especially lung*** [1]. Uniquely, patients may survive with pulmonary metastases for years due to the indolent growth rate, but the disease is ultimately fatal — ***5-year survival 75%, 20-year survival 13%*** [1]
- ***Local recurrence of adenoid cystic carcinoma: 40%*** [1] — even after complete excision, reflecting the microscopic perineural disease that escapes the surgical field

#### 6. Recurrence

- ***Recurrence*** [1] is a complication of both the disease and its treatment
- Pleomorphic adenoma: recurrence after enucleation is 20–45%; after formal parotidectomy < 5%
- Adenoid cystic carcinoma: ***local recurrence 40%*** [1], often many years (even 10–20 years) after initial treatment, due to perineural invasion
- Recurrent tumours are harder to treat because:
  - Tissue planes are scarred from prior surgery
  - The facial nerve is at higher risk of injury during re-operation
  - Multiple recurrent nodules may be scattered throughout the parotid bed (especially recurrent pleomorphic adenoma after enucleation)

---

### II. Complications of Treatment

#### A. ***Parotidectomy Complications*** [1]

The lecture slides explicitly divide these into ***Early*** and ***Late*** complications:

##### ***Early Complications*** [1]

#### 1. ***Bleeding / Haematoma*** [1]

- **Why it happens**: The parotid bed is highly vascular (external carotid artery and its branches — superficial temporal artery, maxillary artery, transverse facial artery — run through or adjacent to the gland). Post-operative reactionary or secondary bleeding can accumulate in the surgical dead space
- **Clinical significance**: A rapidly expanding haematoma in the neck is a **surgical emergency** because:
  - Compression of the airway → stridor → asphyxiation
  - Compression of the vascular pedicle of the facial nerve → ischaemic nerve injury
- **Management**:
  - Prevention: meticulous intraoperative haemostasis; suction drain placement (closed suction drain left for 24–48 hours post-operatively)
  - If expanding haematoma: **immediate return to operating theatre** — open the wound, evacuate the haematoma, secure the bleeding point
  - If airway compromise is imminent before theatre is available: **open the wound at the bedside** (remove skin staples/sutures) to decompress

<Callout title="Emergency" type="error">
A tense, expanding neck swelling after parotidectomy with stridor or respiratory distress = **evacuate the haematoma immediately**. Do not wait for imaging. Open the wound at the bedside if necessary. This is identical in principle to the post-thyroidectomy haematoma emergency.
</Callout>

#### 2. ***Facial Nerve Palsy*** [1]

***Transient ~5%; Permanent ~1%*** [1]

- **Transient palsy (neuropraxia)**: The nerve is anatomically intact but functionally impaired due to:
  - Stretching during dissection (traction injury)
  - Thermal injury from diathermy/cautery used near the nerve
  - Oedema compressing the nerve within its sheath
  - Expected to recover within **6 weeks to 6 months** as the nerve heals and oedema resolves
- **Permanent palsy**: Due to actual nerve transection, avulsion, or irreversible thermal injury. More common with:
  - Total parotidectomy (more extensive dissection)
  - Revision/re-do surgery (scarred tissue planes from previous operation)
  - Malignant tumours requiring deliberate nerve sacrifice

**Branch-specific deficits** (worth knowing for exams):

| Branch | Motor Function Lost | Clinical Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Temporal | Frontalis — raise eyebrow | Brow ptosis; asymmetric forehead |
| Zygomatic | Orbicularis oculi — close eye | **Lagophthalmos → corneal exposure → ulceration** (most dangerous) |
| Buccal | Buccinator, orbicularis oris | Cannot puff cheek; food pocketing; difficulty whistling |
| Marginal mandibular | Depressor anguli oris, depressor labii | Cannot depress lower lip; **asymmetric smile** (very noticeable cosmetically) |
| Cervical | Platysma | Minimal clinical impact |

**Management of facial nerve palsy post-parotidectomy**:
- **Immediate** (if nerve was sacrificed intraoperatively): nerve graft reconstruction at the same procedure (sural nerve or great auricular nerve interposition graft) + static procedures (gold weight, fascia lata sling) [2]
- **If transient palsy**: observe, protect the eye (lubricating eye drops, eye taping at night, moisture chamber), physiotherapy
- **If not recovering by 6 months**: consider dynamic reanimation procedures (hypoglossal-facial nerve anastomosis, cross-facial nerve graft, free gracilis muscle transfer)

#### 3. ***Wound Infection*** [1]

- Relatively uncommon (clean surgical field)
- Risk factors: diabetes, immunosuppression, haematoma (blood is a culture medium), prolonged surgery
- Presents with erythema, warmth, swelling, discharge from the wound, ± fever
- Management: wound swab for culture, antibiotics (empirical then targeted), drainage if abscess forms

#### 4. ***Salivary Fistula*** [1]

- **Why it happens**: If residual functional salivary gland tissue remains after partial parotidectomy, it continues to produce saliva. If the saliva cannot drain normally into the mouth (because the duct has been disrupted), it leaks through the surgical wound
- Also called a **sialocele** when saliva collects as a subcutaneous fluid collection rather than draining externally
- Incidence: ~5–15% after superficial parotidectomy
- **Management**:
  - Usually **self-limiting** — the residual gland tissue eventually atrophies due to disrupted ductal drainage
  - Pressure dressing to the parotid bed
  - Anti-sialagogues (glycopyrrolate — an anticholinergic that reduces salivary secretion)
  - Botulinum toxin injection into the residual gland (blocks acetylcholine release at parasympathetic nerve terminals → reduces salivary output)
  - Repeated aspiration of sialoceles if they accumulate

---

##### ***Late Complications*** [1]

#### 5. ***Recurrence*** [1]

- ***Recurrence*** is listed as a late complication of parotidectomy [1]
- Most relevant for pleomorphic adenoma (if initial excision was inadequate — enucleation or positive margins) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (perineural invasion leading to late recurrence even after adequate surgery)
- ***Avoid enucleation and tumour spillage*** [1] — this is the single most important preventive measure against pleomorphic adenoma recurrence
- ***Consider radiotherapy for recurrent tumour or prevention of recurrence in case of spillage*** [1]
- Recurrent pleomorphic adenoma management is challenging:
  - Often multinodular (seeded along the previous surgical bed)
  - Higher risk of facial nerve injury during re-operation (scarred tissue)
  - Higher risk of further recurrence
  - Adjuvant radiotherapy is often recommended after re-excision

#### 6. ***Frey's Syndrome — Gustatory Sweating*** [1][2]

***Also known as auriculotemporal syndrome or gustatory sweating*** [2]

***Characterised by sweating and flushing of facial skin over parotid bed and neck during mastication*** [2]

***Result of aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres between the otic ganglion and salivary tissues which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels*** [2]

**Detailed pathophysiology (from first principles)**:

1. **Normal anatomy**: The auriculotemporal nerve (a branch of V3, the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve) carries postganglionic **parasympathetic** fibres from the **otic ganglion** to the parotid gland. These fibres are **secretomotor** — they stimulate salivary secretion when you eat
2. **During parotidectomy**: The auriculotemporal nerve is inevitably divided or damaged when the parotid gland is removed. The skin flap is raised, disconnecting the nerve endings from the gland
3. **During healing**: The severed parasympathetic nerve fibres attempt to regenerate. However, instead of finding salivary gland tissue (which has been removed), they **aberrantly regenerate** into the **sympathetic** nerve pathways that innervate:
   - **Sweat glands** (eccrine glands in the skin overlying the parotid bed)
   - **Subcutaneous blood vessels**
4. **Result**: When the patient eats, the parasympathetic stimulation meant for the (now absent) parotid gland instead travels down these misdirected fibres to sweat glands and blood vessels → **sweating** (gustatory sweating) and **flushing** (vasodilation) of the skin over the parotid bed

**Clinical features**:
- Onset: typically 6–18 months post-parotidectomy (time needed for nerve regeneration)
- Triggered by eating, especially sour or strongly flavoured foods (which are the strongest parasympathetic stimulators of salivation)
- Subclinical in up to 60% of patients (detectable only on starch-iodine test); symptomatic in ~10–15%

**Diagnosis**: **Minor's starch-iodine test**
1. Paint iodine solution on the skin over the parotid bed
2. Allow to dry, then dust with starch powder
3. Ask the patient to eat a lemon wedge (strong parasympathetic stimulus)
4. Sweating produces moisture → starch + iodine = **blue-black colour change** in the affected area

**Treatment**:
- **Topical antiperspirants** (aluminium chloride hexahydrate 20%) — blocks sweat gland ducts; first-line
- **Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection** — intradermal injection into the affected area; blocks acetylcholine release at the aberrant parasympathetic nerve endings; highly effective; lasts 6–12 months; can be repeated
- **Surgical interposition** (preventive) — placing a tissue barrier between the skin flap and the parotid bed during the initial parotidectomy prevents the aberrant nerve regeneration. Options include:
  - Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle flap
  - Superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) flap
  - Acellular dermal matrix (AlloDerm)
  - Temporoparietal fascia flap
- **Tympanic neurectomy** (Jacobson's nerve section) — divides the preganglionic parasympathetic fibres proximal to the otic ganglion; effective but invasive, rarely used

#### 7. ***Hypertrophic Scar / Keloid*** [1]

- The ***Modified Blair's incision*** [1] is generally well-concealed (pre-auricular, retro-auricular, upper neck), but some patients are prone to hypertrophic or keloid scarring
- More common in patients with darker skin types (Fitzpatrick IV–VI)
- Management: silicone gel sheets, intralesional corticosteroid injection (triamcinolone), pressure therapy, laser therapy

#### 8. ***Sunken Parotid Area — Cosmetic Problem*** [1]

- ***Sunken parotid area, cosmetic problem*** [1] — after removal of the superficial or total parotid gland, there is a visible **concavity (hollow)** at the angle of the jaw ("parotidectomy defect")
- This is particularly noticeable in thin patients and after total parotidectomy
- **Why it happens**: Loss of parotid gland tissue volume leaves a depression between the mandible, mastoid process, and SCM
- **Management**:
  - **SCM muscle flap** — rotating the anterior border of SCM into the defect during wound closure (most commonly done at the time of parotidectomy)
  - **Fat grafting** — autologous fat injection into the defect
  - **Acellular dermal matrix** placement
  - **Free fat flap** — for larger defects, particularly after total parotidectomy

---

#### B. Submandibulectomy Complications

***Anatomical considerations include close proximity to facial artery and vein, marginal mandibular branch of facial nerve, hypoglossal nerve, lingual nerve and Wharton's duct*** [2]

| Complication | Nerve/Structure | Clinical Consequence | Why It Happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Marginal mandibular nerve injury** | CN VII — marginal mandibular branch | Cannot depress lower lip → asymmetric smile; drooling | The nerve runs superficial to the submandibular gland, draped over the facial vein. It is at risk when raising the skin flap or ligating the facial vein |
| **Hypoglossal nerve injury** | CN XII | Ipsilateral tongue deviation (towards the side of injury); difficulty with speech and swallowing | Runs deep to the submandibular gland; at risk during deep dissection |
| **Lingual nerve injury** | CN V3 — lingual nerve | Loss of general sensation and taste to the anterior 2/3 of the ipsilateral tongue | Loops under Wharton's duct; at risk when dissecting and ligating the duct |
| **Facial artery/vein bleeding** | Facial artery and vein | Haemorrhage; haematoma | These vessels run through the substance of the gland and must be ligated |

---

#### C. Complications of Radiotherapy

Radiotherapy (whether adjuvant or definitive) to the salivary gland region carries specific side effects related to the radiation field:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Xerostomia** (dry mouth) | Radiation damages the serous acinar cells of remaining salivary glands (serous cells are more radiosensitive than mucous cells) → permanent reduction in saliva production | Difficulty eating/swallowing, increased dental caries, oral candidiasis, altered taste |
| **Mucositis** | Radiation-induced epithelial cell death in the oral mucosa → inflammation and ulceration | Painful mouth, difficulty eating, risk of secondary infection; peaks at 2–3 weeks |
| **Osteoradionecrosis (ORN)** | Radiation damages the microvasculature of the mandible → hypovascular, hypoxic, hypocellular bone → unable to heal from minor trauma (e.g., dental extraction) → necrosis | Exposed necrotic bone in the mouth, pain, pathological fracture, fistula. Preventive dental care is essential before RT |
| **Radiation fibrosis / Trismus** | Fibrosis of the pterygoid muscles and temporomandibular joint capsule | Progressive difficulty opening the mouth; occurs months to years after RT |
| **Hypothyroidism** | Incidental radiation to the thyroid gland (which is in the radiation field for neck/parotid RT) | Check TSH regularly post-RT; supplement with levothyroxine if needed |
| **Second malignancy** | Radiation-induced DNA damage in normal tissues within the field → long-term risk of new cancers | Rare but occurs after a latent period of 10–30 years |
| **Carotid artery stenosis** | Radiation-induced accelerated atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries | Increased risk of stroke; monitor with carotid Doppler surveillance |

---

#### D. Complications of Neck Dissection

When neck dissection is performed for nodal metastasis:

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) injury** | Damage during level V dissection → trapezius weakness → shoulder drop, difficulty with arm abduction above horizontal |
| **Internal jugular vein thrombosis/ligation** | Intentional ligation in radical neck dissection → facial oedema, raised intracranial pressure (if bilateral); venous infarction |
| **Chyle leak** | Damage to the thoracic duct (left side) or right lymphatic duct → chylous fistula; milky drain output; managed with pressure, medium-chain triglyceride diet, or surgical repair if persistent |
| **Phrenic nerve injury** | Rare; C3-5 contributions at risk in level IV–V dissection → hemidiaphragm paralysis → dyspnoea |
| **Vagus nerve injury** | CN X → vocal cord paralysis (unilateral: hoarseness; bilateral: airway obstruction) |

---

### III. Prognosis Summary by Tumour Type

Understanding prognosis contextualises the complications — some tumour types carry a much higher risk of disease-related complications:

| Tumour | 5-Year Survival | Key Prognostic Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Pleomorphic adenoma | > 95% (benign) | ***Malignant degeneration 10–15% in 10 years*** [1]; recurrence if enucleated |
| Warthin's tumour | > 99% (benign) | Essentially no malignant potential |
| Mucoepidermoid Ca (low-grade) | > 95% | Behaves almost like a benign tumour |
| Mucoepidermoid Ca (high-grade) | ~50% | Aggressive; nodal and distant metastasis |
| ***Adenoid cystic Ca*** | ***75% at 5 years, 13% at 20 years*** [1] | ***Local recurrence 40%; distant metastasis common (lung); indolent course*** [1] |
| ***Acinic cell Ca*** | ***82% at 5 years, 68% at 10 years, 50% at 25 years*** [1] | Good initial prognosis but slow decline due to late recurrences |
| ***Carcinoma ex PA*** | Variable — ***usually not very good*** [1] | ***Dependent upon stage and histology*** [1]; ***25% with LN involvement at presentation*** [1] |
| Salivary duct carcinoma | ~30–40% at 5 years | Highly aggressive; often HER2+ and AR+ |

<Callout title="Why Does Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma Have Such Divergent 5-Year vs 20-Year Survival?">
***5-year survival is 75% but 20-year survival is only 13%*** [1]. This dramatic drop occurs because:
1. Perineural invasion causes very late local recurrences (10–20 years after surgery)
2. Haematogenous lung metastases grow slowly — patients live with them for years but eventually succumb
3. The "indolent course" is deceptive — patients feel well for years while microscopic disease slowly progresses

This is why adenoid cystic carcinoma requires **lifelong follow-up** — a "cured" patient at 5 years may recur at 15 years.
</Callout>
