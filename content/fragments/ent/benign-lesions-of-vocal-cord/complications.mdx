## Complications of Benign Vocal Cord Lesions

Complications can be divided into two broad categories:

1. **Complications of the disease itself** (what happens if the lesion is left untreated, progresses, or recurs)
2. **Complications of treatment** (iatrogenic complications from surgery and adjuvant therapies)

Both categories are fair game for exams. Let me walk through each systematically.

---

### 1. Complications of the Disease Itself

#### 1.1 Vocal Cord Nodules

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|
| **Chronic dysphonia** | Fibrotic nodules create permanent irregularity of the vocal fold edge and incomplete glottic closure → persistent ***husky voice and easy fatigue due to air leak*** [1] | Loss of professional voice in singers/teachers — can be career-ending |
| **Compensatory muscle tension dysphonia (MTD)** | The patient unconsciously increases supraglottic muscular effort to compensate for the incomplete closure → abnormal patterns become habitual | A "secondary" functional dysphonia layered on top of the organic lesion. Even after nodule resolution, the MTD pattern may persist → requires dedicated speech therapy to "unlearn" |
| **Accompanying vascular lesions** | Chronic microtrauma damages submucosal vessels → **haematoma, haemorrhage, or vascular varices** on the vocal fold [2] | Sudden worsening of voice (haemorrhage); varices may bleed during surgery, complicating excision |
| **Contralateral contact lesion** (more typically with polyps, but occasionally with large nodules) | A large nodule impacts the opposite fold repeatedly → reactive oedema/thickening at the contact point | Second lesion on the contralateral fold worsens voice quality |

> **Why does compensatory MTD matter?** It's a trap for the unwary clinician. You excise the nodules successfully, but the patient still has a bad voice. Why? Because the brain has rewired the phonatory motor pattern into a hyperfunctional state. This is why **post-operative speech therapy** is essential — it retrains normal phonation.

#### 1.2 Vocal Cord Polyps

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|
| **Persistent hoarseness and diplophonia** | Unilateral mass → asymmetric vibration → two different fundamental frequencies | Diplophonia ("diplo" = double, "phonia" = voice) is functionally and socially debilitating |
| **Contralateral contact lesion** | The polyp, especially if pedunculated, flops across and impacts the opposing vocal fold with each vibration cycle → reactive oedema/fibrosis [2] | What started as a unilateral problem becomes bilateral; voice worsens further |
| **Recurrence** (if risk factors not addressed) | If smoking and GERD persist, the conditions for mucosal vessel fragility and haemorrhage remain → new polyp forms even after excision | Repeat surgery needed; each surgery carries its own risks (see below) |

#### 1.3 Polypoid Corditis (Reinke's Oedema)

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|
| **Progressive voice deterioration** | Ongoing capillary damage (from continued smoking) → progressive fluid accumulation → increasing mass of vocal folds → fundamental frequency drops further | Voice becomes increasingly masculine and rough; socially distressing |
| ***Respiratory compromise*** [2] | Severely oedematous, floppy vocal folds prolapse into the airway lumen during inspiration (the "ball-valve" effect of floppy tissue) | Stridor, exertional dyspnoea; in extreme cases → acute airway obstruction requiring emergency intervention (intubation or ***tracheostomy***) |
| **Irreversible voice change** | If smoking continues long-term, chronic oedema and secondary fibrosis permanently alter the SLP — even if smoking is eventually stopped, the voice may not fully recover | Permanent low-pitched voice even after treatment |

> **Why does Reinke's oedema cause airway compromise but nodules generally don't?** Nodules are small, firm, and located at the free edge — they don't significantly encroach on the airway lumen. Reinke's oedema involves **diffuse, bilateral, massive swelling** of the entire vocal fold surface — the floppy tissue can literally obstruct the glottic aperture during inspiration.

#### 1.4 Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)

RRP is the benign lesion with the most serious and diverse complications:

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|
| ***Airway obstruction*** [1] | Exophytic papillomata grow into the narrow paediatric airway → progressive obstruction | ***Respiratory distress*** [2]; may require emergency ***tracheostomy*** [2]; can be life-threatening in children |
| ***Malignant transformation (→ SCC)*** [1] | HPV oncoproteins (E6/E7, especially from HPV subtype 11) can drive accumulation of genetic mutations over time → progression from benign papilloma to dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma | Reported in ~3–5% of RRP cases; more common with HPV 11, irradiated tissue, and longstanding disease; transforms a "benign" disease into a lethal one |
| **Distal spread (tracheobronchial/pulmonary)** | Papillomata extend beyond the larynx into the trachea, bronchi, and even lung parenchyma; facilitated by tracheostomy (creates new squamocolumnar junctions) [2] | Rare but devastating — pulmonary papillomatosis can cause obstructive pneumonia, abscess formation, and is nearly impossible to control surgically |
| **Recurrence after surgery** | HPV persists in **latent state in adjacent "normal" mucosa** → cannot be eradicated by excision of visible lesions [2] | ***Most children with RRP require multiple surgical treatments before puberty and the natural history is eventual recurrence*** [2]; some children need surgery every 2–4 weeks |
| **Psychosocial impact** | Chronic hoarseness, multiple surgeries under GA, missed school/work, parental anxiety | Significant quality-of-life burden on child and family |

<Callout title="Malignant Transformation in RRP" type="error">

***Malignant transformation (→ SCC)*** [1] is the most feared complication of RRP. Key risk factors for transformation:
- **HPV subtype 11** (more aggressive than HPV 6)
- **Prior radiation therapy** — this is why **radiation is absolutely contraindicated in RRP**
- **Smoking** (in adult-onset RRP)
- **Longstanding disease** with multiple recurrences
- **Pulmonary spread**

Suspect transformation if: rapidly enlarging papillomata, ulceration, fixed vocal fold, cervical lymphadenopathy, or failure to respond to usual treatment. **Biopsy is mandatory** if transformation is suspected.

### 2. Complications of Treatment (Iatrogenic)

#### 2.1 Complications of Microlaryngoscopy and Vocal Fold Surgery

These apply to surgery for **all** benign lesions (nodules, polyps, Reinke's oedema, RRP):

##### A. Intraoperative Complications

| Complication | Mechanism | Prevention/Management |
|:-------------|:----------|:----------------------|
| **Dental/lip injury** | Rigid laryngoscope blade transmits force to upper incisors and lips during insertion [3] | Use tooth guard; careful insertion technique; pre-op dental assessment |
| **Mucosal laceration** | Instrumentation of the delicate vocal fold mucosa | Meticulous microsurgical technique; use of microflap approach |
| **Haemorrhage** | Cutting into vascular lesions (haemorrhagic polyps, vascular ectasia) | CO2 laser for haemostasis; adrenaline-soaked pledgets; cautery (sparingly — thermal damage risk) |
| **Airway fire** (with laser use) | CO2 laser or KTP laser + high FiO2 → ignition of the endotracheal tube or tissue | Use lowest possible FiO2 ( < 30%); laser-safe endotracheal tubes; wet pledgets around the surgical field; consider jet ventilation |

##### B. Post-operative Complications (Early)

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|
| **Laryngeal oedema** | Tissue manipulation and instrumentation cause reactive oedema of the vocal folds and supraglottis | Transient hoarseness (worse than pre-op in the first few days); stridor in severe cases; managed with dexamethasone, humidified air, and observation |
| **Worsened voice** (transient) | Post-operative oedema + mucosal healing | Expected — voice typically worsens before it improves; patients must be counselled about this |
| **Granuloma formation** (at the surgical site) | Reactive granulation tissue at the excision site, especially if exposed perichondrium (vocal process) | Presents weeks later with hoarseness, globus sensation; may require further treatment (PPI for reflux-driven granuloma, speech therapy, re-excision) |

##### C. Post-operative Complications (Late/Permanent)

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Consequence |
|:-------------|:----------|:---------------------|
| **Vocal fold scarring (sulcus vocalis/scar)** | Over-aggressive excision damages the superficial lamina propria (Reinke's space) → the cover heals with **fibrosis** instead of the normal gelatinous SLP | The scarred SLP cannot generate a mucosal wave → **permanent dysphonia** with a stiff, immobile cover. This is the **most feared surgical complication** and is essentially irreversible. On stroboscopy, the scar looks identical to malignant infiltration (absent mucosal wave) |
| **Anterior glottic web** | If both vocal folds are denuded of epithelium at the anterior commissure (e.g., aggressive bilateral excision), the raw surfaces adhere during healing → fibrous web connects the two folds anteriorly | Shortens the vibrating length of the vocal folds → high-pitched, strained voice; may cause airway narrowing; very difficult to treat (requires repeated lysis ± keel placement) |
| **Recurrence of the lesion** | Failure to address underlying causes (voice abuse for nodules, smoking for polyps/Reinke's, HPV for RRP) | The lesion reforms; each repeated surgery further increases the cumulative risk of scarring |

<Callout title="The Cardinal Sin of Vocal Fold Surgery">
**Over-excision** — taking too much mucosa, especially at the anterior commissure — is the single most consequential error. It converts a treatable, reversible benign condition into an irreversible iatrogenic one. The goal is always **conservative, precise excision** preserving Reinke's space and the mucosal wave. This is why the microflap technique (raising an epithelial flap, removing the pathology from underneath, then replacing the flap) is preferred over "stripping."
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Complications of Tracheostomy

Tracheostomy may be required for severe Reinke's oedema, bilateral vocal cord palsy, or RRP [1][2]:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism |
|:-------|:-------------|:----------|
| **Intraoperative** | Haemorrhage (thyroid isthmus, anterior jugular veins) | Vessels in the anterior neck are divided during the approach |
| | Tracheal/oesophageal injury | Posterior tracheal wall perforation or false passage |
| | Pneumothorax | Pleural dome (especially in children) is high and can be breached during low tracheostomy |
| **Early** | Tube displacement/obstruction | Mucus plugging; accidental dislodgement before tract matures (first 5–7 days) — can be fatal |
| | Surgical emphysema | Air tracks into subcutaneous tissues if the wound is closed too tightly around the tube |
| | Wound infection | Exposed tracheal stoma in a moist environment |
| **Late** | Tracheal stenosis | Granulation tissue and cicatricial scarring at the stoma or at the cuff site |
| | Tracheo-innominate fistula | Erosion of the tube tip into the innominate artery (brachiocephalic trunk) → catastrophic haemorrhage |
| | **Papilloma seeding at stoma** (specific to RRP) | HPV colonises the new squamocolumnar junction at the tracheostomy site → papillomata grow at and below the stoma → disease spreads distally into the tracheobronchial tree [2] |
| | Swallowing difficulties | The tracheostomy tube tethers the larynx, reducing its upward excursion during swallowing → incomplete epiglottic closure → aspiration risk |

#### 2.3 Complications of Adjuvant Medical Therapy for RRP

| Agent | Complications |
|:------|:-------------|
| ***Cidofovir*** [1] | Nephrotoxicity (rare with intralesional route but reported with systemic use); theoretical carcinogenicity (induced tumours in animal studies — FDA black box warning, though human evidence is lacking); local tissue necrosis if injected into normal mucosa |
| ***Alpha interferon*** [1] | Flu-like symptoms (fever, myalgia, fatigue); neutropaenia/leucopaenia; depression; autoimmune thyroiditis; growth retardation in children (long-term use); rebound recurrence on discontinuation |
| ***Bevacizumab (Avastin)*** [1] | Intralesional: generally well-tolerated; Systemic: hypertension, proteinuria, impaired wound healing, GI perforation (rare), thromboembolic events |

### 3. Summary Table — Complications by Lesion

| Lesion | Disease Complications | Treatment Complications |
|:-------|:---------------------|:------------------------|
| **Nodules** | Chronic dysphonia; compensatory MTD; accompanying vascular lesions [2] | Vocal fold scar (over-excision); anterior web (bilateral surgery); recurrence without speech therapy |
| **Polyps** | Persistent hoarseness/diplophonia; contralateral contact lesion [2]; recurrence | Same as above; haemorrhage from vascular polyps |
| **Reinke's oedema** | Progressive voice deterioration; ***respiratory compromise*** [2]; irreversible voice change | Same surgical complications; recurrence if smoking not stopped |
| **RRP** | ***Airway obstruction*** [1][2]; ***malignant transformation → SCC*** [1]; distal spread; recurrence [2]; psychosocial burden | Vocal fold scar; anterior web; tracheostomy complications (especially papilloma seeding [2]); cidofovir/interferon/bevacizumab side effects [1] |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Complications of Benign Vocal Cord Lesions — Must Know:**

1. **Disease complications**:
   - Nodules: chronic dysphonia + compensatory MTD (the voice may remain poor even after nodule excision if MTD is not addressed with speech therapy)
   - Polyps: contralateral contact lesion [2] (unilateral becomes bilateral); diplophonia
   - Reinke's oedema: ***respiratory compromise*** in severe cases [2] — floppy folds obstruct the airway
   - RRP: ***airway obstruction*** [1][2] (children especially); ***malignant transformation → SCC*** [1] (HPV 11, prior radiation, smoking); distal tracheobronchial/pulmonary spread; ***inevitable recurrence*** [2]

2. **Treatment complications**:
   - **Most feared**: **Vocal fold scarring** from over-aggressive excision → permanent loss of mucosal wave → irreversible dysphonia
   - **Anterior glottic web**: From bilateral denuding of anterior commissure epithelium → two raw surfaces adhere
   - **Tracheostomy**: Papilloma seeding at stoma in RRP [2]; tracheal stenosis; tube displacement
   - **Adjuvant therapy (RRP)**: Cidofovir nephrotoxicity/carcinogenicity; interferon flu-like symptoms/neutropaenia; bevacizumab hypertension/impaired healing [1]

3. **Prevention principles**:
   - Address underlying causes (stop smoking, treat GERD, speech therapy) to prevent recurrence
   - Conservative, microflap surgical technique preserving the SLP
   - Avoid tracheostomy in RRP if possible (distal seeding risk)
   - **Never irradiate RRP** (accelerates malignant transformation)

      question: "What is the most feared surgical complication of vocal fold surgery, what causes it, and why is it essentially irreversible?",
      markscheme: "Vocal fold scarring (fibrosis of the superficial lamina propria / Reinke's space). Caused by over-aggressive excision that strips the SLP. Irreversible because the SLP has a unique gelatinous composition that, once destroyed and replaced by scar tissue, cannot regenerate. The scarred fold loses its mucosal wave, resulting in permanent dysphonia. On stroboscopy it mimics malignancy (absent mucosal wave). Prevention: microflap technique, conservative excision, preserve the SLP."
    },
    {
      question: "A child with RRP undergoes tracheostomy for airway obstruction. Six months later, papillomata are found growing at the stoma site and in the trachea. Explain why this happened.",
      markscheme: "HPV has a predilection for squamocolumnar junctions. The tracheostomy created a new squamocolumnar junction at the stoma site. HPV in the latent state in adjacent mucosa colonised this junction and produced new papillomata. The papillomata can then seed distally into the tracheobronchial tree (distal spread). This is why tracheostomy should be avoided in RRP if at all possible."
    },
    {
      question: "What is an anterior glottic web, what causes it in the context of vocal fold surgery, and how does it affect the voice?",
      markscheme: "An anterior glottic web is a fibrous adhesion connecting the two vocal folds at the anterior commissure. It is caused by bilateral denuding of epithelium at the anterior commissure (e.g., aggressive excision of bilateral nodules or Reinke's oedema in one session). The two raw surfaces adhere during healing, forming a web. It shortens the vibrating length of the vocal folds, causing a high-pitched, strained voice and may narrow the airway. Prevention: avoid bilateral anterior commissure excision; stage bilateral procedures; use microflap technique preserving epithelium."
    },
    {
      question: "Name two feared complications specific to RRP that distinguish it from other benign vocal cord lesions, and state a risk factor for each.",
      markscheme: "(1) Malignant transformation to SCC — risk factors: HPV subtype 11, prior radiation therapy (therefore radiation is contraindicated), smoking, longstanding/recurrent disease, pulmonary spread. (2) Distal tracheobronchial/pulmonary spread — risk factors: tracheostomy (creates new squamocolumnar junction for HPV seeding), aggressive disease especially HPV 11. These complications do not occur with nodules, polyps, or Reinke's oedema."
    },
    {
      question: "Why might a patient's voice remain poor even after successful surgical excision of vocal cord nodules? What is the underlying mechanism and how is it prevented?",
      markscheme: "Compensatory muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). The patient develops abnormal hyperfunctional phonatory patterns to compensate for the incomplete glottic closure caused by the nodules. Even after the nodules are removed and anatomy is restored, the brain's rewired motor patterns persist — the patient continues to strain unnecessarily. This is prevented and treated by post-operative speech therapy to retrain normal relaxed phonation. This is why speech therapy is mandatory both before and after surgery for nodules."
