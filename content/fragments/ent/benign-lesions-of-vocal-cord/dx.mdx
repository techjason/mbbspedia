## Diagnosis of Benign Lesions of the Vocal Cord

### 1. Diagnostic Principles — Why Is There No "Criteria" Like for Rheumatic Fever?

Benign vocal cord lesions do **not** have formal diagnostic criteria in the way that systemic diseases do (e.g., Jones criteria, ACR criteria). Instead, diagnosis relies on a **pattern recognition approach** combining:

1. **Clinical history** — the story (onset, duration, voice demands, smoking, red flags)
2. **Laryngoscopic appearance** — the definitive diagnostic step
3. **Stroboscopy** — for subtle lesions and to differentiate benign from malignant
4. **Histopathology** — only when malignancy cannot be excluded

The diagnosis of a specific benign lesion is essentially a **clinical-endoscopic diagnosis** — you see the characteristic lesion on laryngoscopy in the right clinical context, and that is your diagnosis. Biopsy is reserved for uncertainty.

> Think of it like this: you don't need a biopsy to diagnose a vocal cord nodule in a teacher with bilateral symmetrical lesions at the anterior 1/3 junction — the diagnosis is staring at you through the scope. But you absolutely need a biopsy for an irregular unilateral mass in a smoker.

---

### 2. Diagnostic Criteria (Pattern-Based)

While not "formal criteria," each benign lesion has a **diagnostic pattern** — a combination of history + laryngoscopy findings that, taken together, clinch the diagnosis:

#### 2.1 Vocal Cord Nodules

| Domain | Diagnostic Pattern |
|:-------|:-------------------|
| **History** | ***Chronic voice abuse*** (***singer, teacher***) [1]; gradual onset of hoarseness; voice worsens with use, improves with rest |
| **Demographics** | Female > male; children and young adults [2] |
| **Laryngoscopy** | ***Bilateral and (always) symmetrical nodules at the junction of anterior and middle 1/3 of vocal folds*** [1] |
| **Stroboscopy** | Hourglass glottic closure pattern; reduced mucosal wave at nodule site; phase symmetry preserved (both folds affected equally) |
| **Response to therapy** | Improvement with voice therapy confirms the diagnosis retrospectively (a "therapeutic diagnosis") |

<Callout title="Diagnostic Pearl — Nodules">
If it's bilateral, symmetrical, at the anterior 1/3 junction, in a voice abuser → it's nodules. You don't need a biopsy. If it looks atypical (asymmetric, unilateral, irregular surface) → it's NOT a nodule, and you must reconsider your diagnosis.
</Callout>

#### 2.2 Vocal Cord Polyp

| Domain | Diagnostic Pattern |
|:-------|:-------------------|
| **History** | ***Acute vocal trauma*** [1] (e.g., shouting episode); may have sudden onset of hoarseness; smoking, GERD as cofactors [2] |
| **Demographics** | Adults, more common in males; rare in children [2] |
| **Laryngoscopy** | ***Unilateral vocal cord lesion*** [1] at mid-cord [2]; pedunculated (stalked) or sessile; may be translucent, haemorrhagic, or pale; ± contralateral "contact lesion" [2] |
| **Stroboscopy** | Asymmetric vibration; aperiodic motion; reduced mucosal wave over the polyp; phase asymmetry (one fold vibrates differently from the other) |

#### 2.3 Polypoid Corditis (Reinke's Oedema)

| Domain | Diagnostic Pattern |
|:-------|:-------------------|
| **History** | Heavy **smoking** [2]; gradual deepening of voice; middle-aged female complaining of ***"sounding like a man"*** [2] |
| **Associated conditions** | Laryngopharyngeal reflux, hypothyroidism [2] |
| **Laryngoscopy** | Bilateral, diffuse, boggy/gelatinous swelling of the entire vocal fold; ***vocal folds appear swollen and floppy*** [2]; "water balloon" or "sausage-like" appearance |
| **Stroboscopy** | Exaggerated, floppy mucosal wave (the fluid-filled SLP is hypercompliant); sluggish vibration due to increased mass |

#### 2.4 Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis (RRP)

| Domain | Diagnostic Pattern |
|:-------|:-------------------|
| **History** | Child aged 2–5 with progressive hoarseness → stridor → respiratory distress [2]; or adult 30–40s with hoarseness |
| **Risk factors** | Born via vaginal delivery to mother with HPV/condylomata [2] |
| **Laryngoscopy** | Multiple exophytic, papillomatous (raspberry/cauliflower) growths; multifocal; commonly on vocal folds, ventricles, subglottis [2] |
| **Histopathology** | **Required for confirmation**: squamous papilloma with fibrovascular cores; HPV typing (subtypes 6 and 11) by PCR or in situ hybridisation [2] |
| **Recurrence** | ***No cure; eventual recurrence*** after excision is part of the diagnostic natural history [2] |

<Callout title="When Is Biopsy Mandatory?" type="error">

Biopsy is **NOT** routinely needed for classic vocal cord nodules (bilateral, symmetrical, voice abuser) or classic Reinke's oedema (bilateral, smoker, floppy folds).

Biopsy **IS** mandatory when:
- The lesion is **atypical** in appearance (irregular, ulcerated, exophytic but not clearly papillomatous)
- There is ***leukoplakia or erythroplakia*** — ***Biopsy !!!*** [1]
- Malignancy cannot be excluded on clinical-endoscopic grounds
- RRP is suspected (to confirm HPV and exclude malignant transformation)
- Unilateral lesion in a smoker with red flags

### 3. Diagnostic Algorithm

The following algorithm represents the clinical approach to a patient presenting with **dysphonia**, systematically leading to the diagnosis of benign vocal cord lesions while appropriately excluding malignancy and neurological causes.

### 4. Investigation Modalities — Detailed Breakdown

#### 4.1 History and Voice Assessment

Before any instrument touches the patient, the history does most of the diagnostic work:

***Salient history*** [1]:
- ***Smoking*** — risk factor for polyps, Reinke's oedema, leukoplakia, SCC
- ***Occupation, voice demand*** — risk factor for nodules (teachers, singers, call-centre workers)
- ***Details of hoarseness*** [1]:
  - ***Acute vs chronic*** — acute (< 3 weeks) suggests laryngitis; chronic suggests structural lesion
  - ***Progression*** — progressive worsening raises concern for malignancy
  - ***Persistent (organic lesion) vs fluctuating (functional)*** — this is one of the most powerful discriminators
- ***Associated "red flag" symptoms for malignancy*** [1]:
  - ***Bleeding*** — suggests mucosal ulceration/tumour erosion
  - ***Shortness of breath*** — airway obstruction by tumour bulk
  - ***Dysphagia*** — extension to hypopharynx/oesophageal inlet

**Perceptual Voice Assessment** — the GRBAS Scale:

This is a standardised, subjective assessment tool used by speech therapists and ENT clinicians:

| Parameter | What It Assesses | Scale |
|:----------|:-----------------|:------|
| **G** — Grade | Overall severity of voice abnormality | 0 (normal) to 3 (severe) |
| **R** — Roughness | Irregularity of vibration (suggests mass lesion or stiffness) | 0–3 |
| **B** — Breathiness | Air leak through incomplete glottic closure | 0–3 |
| **A** — Asthenia | Weakness of voice (suggests neurological cause or poor breath support) | 0–3 |
| **S** — Strain | Hyperfunctional effort (suggests MTD or compensatory behaviour) | 0–3 |

> **Why use GRBAS?** It gives you a quick, reproducible snapshot of the voice quality that helps differentiate benign lesions (R and B dominant) from neurological causes (A dominant) from functional causes (S dominant). It also serves as a **baseline** to monitor response to therapy.

---

#### 4.2 Flexible Nasolaryngoscopy (FNL)

> ***Flexible laryngoscopy to assess extent*** [1]

This is the **first-line investigation** for any patient with hoarseness > 3 weeks (or with red flags regardless of duration).

**How it works**: A thin, flexible fibreoptic endoscope is passed through the nose → nasopharynx → oropharynx → hypopharynx, giving a direct view of the larynx from above. Performed **awake** in clinic, no anaesthesia needed beyond topical nasal decongestant/anaesthetic.

**What to assess systematically**:

| Structure | What to Look For | Relevance |
|:----------|:-----------------|:----------|
| **Supraglottis** (epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, false vocal folds) | Mass, oedema, asymmetry | Supraglottic tumours, laryngocele |
| **True vocal folds** | Mass (laterality, location, surface character), colour, oedema | The key structures for benign lesion diagnosis |
| **Vocal fold MOBILITY** | Symmetric adduction/abduction during phonation and respiration | **Immobile fold = palsy** — this is the single most important observation to make [2] |
| **Anterior commissure** | Lesion crossing midline | Malignancy (T1b glottic SCC) |
| **Subglottis** | Visible below the free edge of the fold | Subglottic extension of tumour; subglottic haemangioma in infants |
| **Glottic closure pattern** | Complete vs incomplete; hourglass vs posterior gap | Hourglass = nodules; posterior gap = palsy; anterior gap = presbylaryngis |

**Key findings by diagnosis**:

| Diagnosis | FNL Appearance |
|:----------|:---------------|
| **Nodules** | ***Bilateral, symmetrical*** small elevations at ***junction of anterior and middle 1/3*** [1] |
| **Polyp** | ***Unilateral*** pedunculated/sessile mass at mid-cord [1] |
| **Reinke's oedema** | Bilateral, diffuse, ***swollen and floppy*** folds [2] |
| **RRP** | Multiple papillomatous growths, multifocal [2] |
| **SCC** | Irregular, ulcerated or exophytic mass; may see ***leukoplakia (whitish plaque)*** or ***erythroplakia (reddish plaque)*** [1] |
| **RLN palsy** | Immobile vocal fold in paramedian position [2] |
| **MTD/Psychogenic** | Normal-appearing folds; supraglottic hyperfunction; paradoxical movement on cough |

---

#### 4.3 Videostroboscopy

> ***Stroboscopy*** [1]:
> - ***Voice of patient picked up by microphone***
> - ***Light source emitting at or near fundamental frequency of voice***
> - ***Illusion of slow motion of vocal cord vibration***
> - ***Detect subtle vocal cord lesions*** [1]

**Principle from first principles**: The vocal folds vibrate at ~100–250 Hz during phonation — far too fast for the naked eye to resolve. Stroboscopy exploits the **stroboscopic effect**: a flashing light is synchronised to the voice frequency (picked up by a microphone attached to the patient's neck). By flashing at a rate *slightly different* from the vibration frequency, consecutive flashes capture the vocal fold at slightly different phases of its cycle, creating an ***illusion of slow motion*** [1].

**What stroboscopy uniquely reveals**:

| Parameter | What It Tells You | Clinical Application |
|:----------|:------------------|:---------------------|
| **Mucosal wave** | Whether the cover (epithelium + SLP) slides freely over the body | **Present but altered** = benign; **ABSENT** = malignancy (tumour infiltrates SLP, stiffening it) |
| **Amplitude** | How far the fold moves laterally during each vibration cycle | Reduced amplitude over a stiff lesion (fibrotic nodule, scar, carcinoma) |
| **Phase symmetry** | Whether both folds vibrate in sync | Asymmetric = unilateral lesion (polyp) or palsy |
| **Periodicity** | Whether vibration is regular or chaotic | Aperiodic = mass lesion disrupting regular vibration |
| **Glottic closure** | Pattern of closure during the closed phase | Hourglass = nodules; spindle-shaped = atrophy/palsy; complete = normal |

**Stroboscopy findings by diagnosis**:

| Diagnosis | Mucosal Wave | Amplitude | Closure Pattern | Symmetry |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|:----------------|:---------|
| **Nodules** | Reduced at nodule site | Reduced at nodule | **Hourglass** (folds touch only at nodule points) | Symmetric |
| **Polyp** | Reduced over polyp | Asymmetric (affected side reduced) | Irregular gap | **Asymmetric** |
| **Reinke's oedema** | **Exaggerated**, floppy | Increased (hypermobile) | Irregular/incomplete | Symmetric |
| **Cyst** (submucosal) | Markedly reduced/absent over cyst | Reduced | Asymmetric gap | Asymmetric |
| **SCC** | **ABSENT** | Absent/markedly reduced | Incomplete | Asymmetric |
| **Scar / Sulcus** | Absent along the scar | Reduced | Spindle-shaped gap | Variable |

<Callout title="The Mucosal Wave — Your Best Friend in DDx" type="idea">
If you remember one thing about stroboscopy: **the mucosal wave differentiates benign from malignant**. A present (even if altered) mucosal wave is reassuring. An absent mucosal wave is alarming and demands biopsy. Why? Because malignant infiltration stiffens the superficial lamina propria — the very layer that generates the wave.

#### 4.4 Microlaryngoscopy (Direct Laryngoscopy Under GA)

This is the **gold standard** for detailed assessment and intervention. It is performed in the operating theatre under general anaesthesia with a rigid laryngoscope that provides magnified, binocular vision of the vocal folds.

**When is it indicated?**:
- When **biopsy** is needed (suspected malignancy, leukoplakia/erythroplakia, RRP confirmation) — ***Biopsy to obtain histological diagnosis*** [1]
- When **surgical excision** is planned (polyp removal, RRP debulking)
- When FNL findings are inconclusive and detailed examination is needed
- When RRP lesion mapping is required before ablation

**What it adds over FNL**:
- **Magnification** (using operating microscope or 0°/70° telescopes)
- **Bimanual instrumentation** — the surgeon can palpate the lesion, assess its mobility, and excise it
- **Biopsy capability** — ***microlaryngoscopy + biopsy*** [1]
- Assessment of submucosal extent (especially for cysts vs polyps)

**Instruments used** [2]:
- ***Cold steel excision (instruments like forceps, scissors)*** — standard for polyps and nodules
- ***CO2 laser*** — ***less bleeding but more time-consuming, reserved for complicated cases*** [2]; also used for RRP ablation
- Pulsed KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate) laser — increasingly used for vascular lesions and RRP (angiolytic laser that targets haemoglobin in feeding vessels)

---

#### 4.5 Histopathology

**When obtained** (via microlaryngoscopy biopsy):

| Diagnosis | Histological Findings |
|:----------|:----------------------|
| **Nodules** | Thickened epithelium; basement membrane thickening; subepithelial fibrosis; no atypia |
| **Polyp** | Oedematous stroma (myxoid polyp) OR organised haematoma with haemosiderin deposits and fibrin; dilated blood vessels; lined by normal or mildly keratinised epithelium; no atypia |
| **Reinke's oedema** | Oedematous, pale, amorphous material (Reinke's space fluid); dilated subepithelial vessels; stromal oedema; epithelium usually normal or mildly thickened |
| **RRP** | **Squamous papilloma** — finger-like projections of stratified squamous epithelium with fibrovascular cores; koilocytes (HPV-infected cells with perinuclear halo and nuclear wrinkling); HPV subtypes 6/11 on PCR [2] |
| **Leukoplakia** | Hyperkeratosis ± dysplasia (graded mild/moderate/severe) ± carcinoma in situ ± invasive SCC |
| **SCC** | Nests/sheets of atypical squamous cells with keratinisation, mitoses, stromal invasion |

> **Why do we biopsy RRP but not classic nodules?** RRP requires histological confirmation because (a) you need to confirm it's not a verrucous carcinoma (which can look papillomatous), (b) HPV typing has prognostic implications (HPV 11 = more aggressive), and (c) longstanding RRP has a small risk of malignant transformation. Nodules have a pathognomonic appearance on laryngoscopy and carry zero malignant potential.

---

#### 4.6 Panendoscopy

> ***Panendoscopy to look for synchronous lesion in upper aerodigestive tract*** [1]

**What is it?** A combined procedure under GA consisting of ***direct laryngoscopy + bronchoscopy + OGD (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy)*** [2].

**Why do we do it?** The concept of **field cancerisation** (also called "field change" or "condemned mucosa"): in patients exposed to carcinogens like tobacco and alcohol, the **entire mucosal lining** of the upper aerodigestive tract has been exposed → there is a risk of **synchronous second primary tumours** (reported in 5–15% of H&N SCC patients).

**When is it indicated?**:
- **Confirmed or suspected laryngeal malignancy** — to look for synchronous lesions in the oropharynx, hypopharynx, oesophagus, and tracheobronchial tree [1]
- **NOT routinely indicated for benign lesions** — unless there is diagnostic uncertainty

---

#### 4.7 Imaging

##### Ultrasound Neck ± FNAC

> ***Ultrasound neck to assess nodal metastasis +/- fine needle aspiration*** [1]

- **When**: When malignancy is suspected or confirmed
- **Purpose**: Assess cervical lymph nodes for metastatic involvement
- **FNAC**: If a suspicious node is identified (hypoechoic, > 1cm, rounded, loss of hilum), USG-guided FNAC provides cytological confirmation
- **NOT needed for benign vocal cord lesions** — but important in the differential if malignancy is a concern

##### Contrast CT Neck

> ***Contrast CT neck to assess extent*** [1]

- **When**: Confirmed or suspected laryngeal malignancy
- **Purpose**: Evaluate tumour extent, extra-laryngeal spread, cartilage invasion (thyroid/cricoid), pre-epiglottic and paraglottic space involvement, and lymph node status [2]
- **NOT needed for benign vocal cord lesions** unless:
  - Vocal cord palsy is found → CT chest (to assess RLN course from skull base to mediastinum)
  - Subglottic extension of RRP needs assessment
  - Severe Reinke's oedema with airway compromise needing pre-operative assessment

##### Other Imaging

| Investigation | Indication |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **CT chest** | Unilateral vocal cord palsy (especially left) → rule out lung CA, mediastinal mass, aortic aneurysm [2] |
| **MRI neck** | Better soft-tissue resolution than CT; useful for delineating tumour extent in H&N cancer |
| **CXR** | Baseline in smokers; pre-operative assessment |

---

#### 4.8 Adjunctive Investigations

| Investigation | When & Why |
|:-------------|:-----------|
| **Thyroid function tests (TFTs)** | Reinke's oedema — to exclude hypothyroidism as a contributing cause [2] |
| **pH monitoring / impedance testing** | If laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is suspected as a contributing factor for nodules, polyps, or Reinke's oedema |
| **Laryngeal EMG** | Vocal cord palsy — to ***distinguish vocal cord paralysis from mechanical fixation secondary to scar tissue or cricoarytenoid joint fixation*** [2] |
| **HPV testing** (PCR, in situ hybridisation) | RRP — confirms aetiology and identifies HPV subtype (prognostic value: HPV 11 more aggressive) |
| **Pulmonary function tests** | Severe Reinke's oedema or RRP with airway compromise — quantify degree of obstruction |

---

#### 4.9 Summary: Which Investigations for Which Lesion?

| Investigation | Nodules | Polyp | Reinke's Oedema | RRP | Suspected Malignancy |
|:-------------|:--------|:------|:-----------------|:----|:---------------------|
| **History + GRBAS** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **FNL** | ✅ (diagnostic) | ✅ (diagnostic) | ✅ (diagnostic) | ✅ (suggestive) | ✅ (suggestive) |
| **Stroboscopy** | ✅ (confirms) | ✅ (confirms) | ✅ (confirms) | Optional | ✅ (absent wave → alarm) |
| **Microlaryngoscopy** | Only if surgery needed | ✅ (therapeutic) | Only if surgery needed | ✅ (therapeutic + biopsy) | ✅ (***biopsy***) [1] |
| **Histopathology** | Not routine | Not routine | Not routine | ✅ (mandatory) | ✅ (***mandatory***) [1] |
| **Panendoscopy** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ [1] |
| **USG neck ± FNAC** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ [1] |
| **CT/MRI neck** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | If subglottic extension | ✅ [1] |
| **TFTs** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (exclude hypothyroidism) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Laryngeal EMG** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | If palsy found [2] |

### 5. Interpretation Framework — Putting It All Together

When you perform laryngoscopy and stroboscopy on a patient with hoarseness, here is the structured interpretation:

1. **Is the fold mobile?** → If no: vocal cord palsy → investigate cause
2. **Is there a visible lesion?** → If no: functional/neurological/psychogenic → speech therapy assessment
3. **What does the lesion look like?**
   - Bilateral, symmetrical, ant 1/3 junction → **Nodules**
   - Unilateral, mid-cord, pedunculated → **Polyp**
   - Bilateral, diffuse, floppy → **Reinke's oedema**
   - Papillomatous, multifocal → **RRP** → biopsy
   - Irregular, ulcerated, white/red plaque → **Suspect malignancy** → ***biopsy !!!*** [1]
4. **What does the mucosal wave show?**
   - Present (altered) → confirms benign
   - Absent → suspect malignancy → biopsy
5. **Are there red flags?** (***Bleeding, SOB, dysphagia*** [1], lymphadenopathy, weight loss)
   - If yes → full malignancy workup (panendoscopy, USG neck ± FNAC, CT neck) [1]

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Diagnosis of Benign Vocal Cord Lesions — Key Points:**

1. Diagnosis is **clinical-endoscopic** — based on history + characteristic laryngoscopic appearance. No formal "diagnostic criteria" exist.

2. ***Flexible laryngoscopy*** is the **first-line investigation** for hoarseness > 3 weeks [1]. Assess: vocal fold mobility, lesion characteristics, glottic closure.

3. ***Stroboscopy*** creates an ***illusion of slow motion of vocal cord vibration*** [1] and is crucial for:
   - ***Detecting subtle vocal cord lesions*** [1]
   - Differentiating benign (mucosal wave present) from malignant (mucosal wave absent)

4. ***Biopsy*** (via ***microlaryngoscopy***) is mandatory for: suspected malignancy, ***leukoplakia/erythroplakia*** [1], RRP confirmation, and any atypical lesion.

5. ***Panendoscopy*** is for malignancy only — to look for ***synchronous lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract*** [1].

6. ***USG neck ± FNAC*** and ***contrast CT neck*** are staging investigations for malignancy [1], not for benign lesions.

7. Adjunctive tests: TFTs for Reinke's oedema (hypothyroidism); laryngeal EMG for vocal cord palsy (to distinguish paralysis from mechanical fixation) [2].

CT chest is mandatory to exclude these causes. Laryngeal EMG can also distinguish true paralysis from cricoarytenoid joint fixation."
