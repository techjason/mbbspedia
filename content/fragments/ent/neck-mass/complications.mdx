## Complications of Neck Mass Conditions and Their Treatments

Complications related to neck masses can be organised into two broad categories: **(A) complications of the underlying pathology itself** (what happens if you do NOT treat, or the disease progresses) and **(B) complications of treatment** (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy). Both are high-yield for exams.

### 1. Complications of the Underlying Pathology

#### 1.1 Congenital Neck Masses — Complications of Non-Treatment

***"Congenital lesion in general should be removed surgically at the appropriate age. Otherwise these lesions may increase in size leading to functional disturbances later."*** [1]

| Condition | Complications if Untreated | Pathophysiological Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| **Thyroglossal duct cyst** | ***Abscess (tenderness, fever), fistula formation, malignant transformation to papillary CA (rare)*** [5] | The cyst is lined by thyroid epithelium → susceptible to infection (especially during URTI when organisms track from foramen cecum); chronic inflammation can lead to fistula to skin; the thyroid epithelium retains malignant potential (papillary CA in < 1% of cases) |
| **Branchial cleft cyst** | Recurrent infections, fistula tract to skin, pharyngeal oedema → airway and swallowing disorders [2] | Cyst communicates with pharyngeal remnants → recurrent seeding from pharyngeal flora; chronic inflammation causes fistula formation |
| **Cystic hygroma** | Progressive enlargement → airway compromise, feeding difficulty, cosmetic deformity | Lymphatic malformation does not involute spontaneously (unlike haemangioma). Can enlarge rapidly with intercurrent URTI or haemorrhage into the cyst |

#### 1.2 Malignant Neck Masses — Disease Progression

| Disease | Complications of Progression | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| **NPC** | Skull base invasion → CN III-VI palsies (cavernous sinus), CN IX-XII (jugular foramen/hypoglossal canal). Distant metastasis: bone (75%), liver, lung [4] | NPC grows from nasopharynx superiorly into skull base foramina |
| **Oral cavity / Oropharyngeal SCC** | Airway obstruction (tumour bulk), haemorrhage (erosion into vessels), aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition (dysphagia/odynophagia), fistula formation | Direct local invasion into muscles, mandible, carotid sheath |
| **Thyroid carcinoma** | Tracheal invasion → stridor, oesophageal invasion → dysphagia, RLN invasion → hoarseness, distant metastasis (bone/lung in follicular CA; LN in papillary CA) | Local structures immediately adjacent to thyroid gland |
| **Lymphoma** | Superior vena cava syndrome (mediastinal mass), tumour lysis syndrome (with treatment), B symptoms, organ infiltration | Bulky lymphadenopathy compressing vascular structures |
| **Deep neck abscess (untreated)** | Airway obstruction, mediastinitis (retropharyngeal abscess tracks into mediastinum via danger space), IJV thrombosis (Lemierre's syndrome), sepsis, necrotising fasciitis | Fascial planes of the neck are continuous with the mediastinum; the retropharyngeal space extends from skull base to T4 level |

---

### 2. Complications of Treatment

#### 2.1 Complications of Thyroidectomy

This is the **single most important complication set to know** for neck mass management because thyroid surgery is so common.

##### Immediate (Intraoperative) Complications [4][5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Intraoperative bleeding** | Injury to superior/inferior thyroid artery or thyroid veins | Haemorrhage in surgical field | Intraoperative haemostasis, ligation |
| **Oesophageal injury** | Direct injury during dissection (especially posteriorly) | Post-op dysphagia, mediastinitis if unrecognised | Primary repair, drain, antibiotics |
| **Tracheal injury** | Direct surgical injury | Air leak, surgical emphysema | Primary repair |
| **Tracheomalacia** [5] | ***Floppy tracheal wall due to chronic compression*** by longstanding goitre → cartilage rings weaken and soften over time | Post-extubation stridor and airway collapse | May require prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, or tracheal stenting |
| **Thyroid storm** [4] | ***Develops in patients with longstanding untreated hyperthyroidism precipitated by acute event such as surgery, trauma or infection. Rapid ↑ in serum thyroid hormone → increased response to sympathetic inputs from catecholamine by permissive effect*** | ***Hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypertension → heart failure with hypotension and arrhythmia*** [4] | β-blocker (propranolol), thionamide (carbimazole/PTU), Lugol's iodine, hydrocortisone, cooling, supportive ICU care |
| ***Superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) injury*** [4] | ***SLN supplies the cricothyroid muscle which lengthens (tenses) the vocal cord to produce high-pitched sound*** — the external branch of SLN runs close to the superior thyroid artery at the upper pole | ***Vocal fatigue and changes in voice quality*** [4], ***loss of high pitch, poor volume, easy fatigue*** [5] | Usually observed; voice therapy. Prevention: careful identification of EBSLN during superior pole ligation |
| ***Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury*** [4] | ***RLN supplies all intrinsic muscles of larynx except cricothyroid*** — runs in tracheo-oesophageal groove near inferior thyroid artery | See table below | See table below |

**RLN injury — detailed breakdown** [4][5]:

| | ***Partial injury (irritation)*** | ***Complete injury*** |
|---|---|---|
| ***Unilateral*** | ***Hoarseness*** | ***Hoarseness*** (vocal cord in paramedian position) |
| ***Bilateral*** | ***Airway obstruction (6 adductors > 2 abductors)*** — the adductor muscles (which close the cords) are more numerous and powerful than the sole abductor (posterior cricoarytenoid), so with partial/irritative bilateral injury, the cords tend to adduct → airway compromise | ***Hoarseness: stay in anatomical position (i.e. mid-open)*** — complete denervation means no muscle tone at all, both cords fall to the cadaveric (intermediate) position → airway patent but voice very breathy [5] |

Why is bilateral **partial** injury paradoxically more dangerous than bilateral **complete** injury? With partial injury, the adductor muscles (thyroarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, interarytenoid — 6 muscles total) are partially innervated and spasm, overpowering the posterior cricoarytenoid (the only abductor, 2 muscles) → cords approximate → airway obstruction → emergency. With complete bilateral transection, ALL muscles are paralysed → cords rest in the cadaveric mid-open position → airway is compromised but not completely obstructed (patient can breathe, though voice is very weak).

**Management of vocal cord palsy** [5]: ***Cord medialisation procedures — e.g. injection thyroplasty, open thyroplasty (Gortex)*** for unilateral palsy. Bilateral adductor spasm may require emergency tracheostomy followed by later cordotomy or arytenoidectomy.

##### Early Complications (within 24–48 hours) [4][5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Reactionary haemorrhage*** [5] | ***Reactionary bleeding within first 24h post-op → haematoma compresses on venous return → laryngeal oedema → complete closure of vocal cord → asphyxiation*** [5] | Neck swelling, tachycardia, stridor, respiratory distress | ***Remove ALL stitches from skin down to cervical fascia at bedside (FIRST action!)*** → ***Resuscitation: protect airway, give supplemental oxygen*** → ***Arrange emergency operating theatre (EOT) for haemostasis*** [5] |
| **Wound infection** | Contamination during surgery | Erythema, swelling, purulent discharge, fever | Antibiotics, drainage if abscess. (***Note: wound infection is NOT a commonly recognised complication of thyroidectomy because it is a clean surgical field*** [5]) |

<Callout title="Post-Thyroidectomy Neck Haematoma — An Emergency!" type="error">
A post-thyroidectomy haematoma is a life-threatening emergency. The key mechanism is: bleeding → haematoma under the strap muscles and deep cervical fascia → venous congestion (the veins are thin-walled and compress before arteries) → laryngeal oedema → airway obstruction → death. **The first action is to open ALL stitches at the bedside** — from skin sutures down to the deep cervical fascia — to release the compressing haematoma. This can be done by any doctor, nurse, or even a medical student in an emergency. Do NOT wait for the operating theatre. Then protect the airway and arrange EOT for formal haemostasis. [5]
</Callout>

##### Late Complications [4][5]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Hypoparathyroidism → Hypocalcaemia*** | ***Most common complication*** of total thyroidectomy [4][5]. Inadvertent removal, devascularisation, or bruising of parathyroid glands → ↓ PTH → ↓ serum Ca²⁺. ***Only in total thyroidectomy*** [5] (hemithyroidectomy has < 1% risk because contralateral glands are untouched) | ***Perioral numbness***, ***carpopedal spasm, Chvostek's sign, Trousseau's sign*** [4][5]. ***Severe hypoCa can lead to laryngospasm requiring emergency intubation / surgical airway*** [5] | ***Acute: IV calcium gluconate (10–20 mL of 10% over 10 min — slow bolus)*** [4]. ***Replacement: Calcium carbonate + Calcitriol (Vitamin D)*** [4]. Routinely check Ca on post-op Day 1 [5] |
| ***Hungry bone syndrome*** [4] | ***Rapid, profound hypocalcaemia due to sudden drop in PTH, causing rapid deposition of Ca into demineralised bone*** [5]. Occurs in patients with pre-existing hyperparathyroidism or thyrotoxicosis with bone disease — after gland removal, the suppressed normal parathyroids cannot compensate, and avid osteoblast activity "sucks" calcium into bone | Severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia, often refractory to standard calcium replacement | Aggressive IV calcium infusion, calcium + vitamin D supplementation [5] |
| **Hypothyroidism** | After total thyroidectomy (100% require replacement) [5] or subtotal thyroidectomy (variable) | Fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation | Lifelong levothyroxine (T4) replacement |
| **Recurrence** | Incomplete excision of malignant tissue, or new disease | New neck mass, rising thyroglobulin (differentiated CA) or calcitonin (MTC) | Re-investigation (USG, FNA, imaging), revision surgery, RAI |
| ***Hypertrophic scar / keloid*** [4] | Abnormal wound healing in the anterior neck (Kocher incision is cosmetically sensitive) | Raised, thickened scar | Silicone sheets, steroid injection, revision if severe |

**Post-op dyspnoea after thyroidectomy — differential diagnosis** [5]:
- ***Haemorrhage***: hypovolaemic shock, laryngeal oedema from compression
- ***Bilateral RLN irritation*** causing adductor spasm → airway obstruction
- ***Laryngeal spasm due to hypocalcaemia***
- ***Injury to trachea / pneumothorax***
- ***Tracheomalacia*** (floppy tracheal wall from chronic compression)

This is an excellent structured answer for an OSCE/exam question asking "What are the causes of post-thyroidectomy stridor?"

#### 2.2 Complications of Neck Dissection

Neck dissection involves removing cervical lymph nodes (selective, modified radical, or radical). The complications depend on which structures are preserved or sacrificed [4][11].

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| ***Spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) injury*** | CN XI traverses the posterior triangle and runs through/near level II and V nodes. Radical neck dissection intentionally sacrifices it; modified radical preserves it but it can still be injured | ***Shoulder drop, inability to abduct arm above 90° (trapezius weakness), "winging" of scapula*** | Physiotherapy; nerve grafting if transected |
| ***Internal jugular vein (IJV) sacrifice*** | Radical neck dissection removes IJV | Facial and cerebral oedema (especially if bilateral); risk of raised ICP if bilateral IJV ligation | Avoid bilateral radical dissection simultaneously |
| ***Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) sacrifice*** | Radical neck dissection removes SCM | Cosmetic defect (loss of neck contour), decreased neck rotation strength | Reconstructive options; modified radical avoids this |
| **Chyle leak / chylothorax** | Thoracic duct injury (left side, level IV/Vb dissection — thoracic duct enters at junction of left subclavian and IJV) | Milky drainage from wound drain; high output can cause nutritional depletion, immunosuppression | Conservative: NPO + TPN + octreotide. Surgical re-exploration with ligation if high output ( > 1 L/day) or persistent |
| **Seroma** | Disruption of lymphatics → serous fluid collection [11] | Swelling under the flap, fluctuant | Drain insertion or percutaneous aspiration [11] |
| **Haemorrhage / haematoma** | Injury to carotid, jugular, or branches | Neck swelling, airway compromise | Emergency exploration |
| **Wound infection** | Post-operative contamination | Erythema, fever, discharge | Antibiotics, I&D if abscess |
| **Marginal mandibular nerve injury** | Runs superficial to submandibular gland, within level Ib dissection zone | Ipsilateral lower lip droop (cannot depress lower lip, asymmetric smile) | Usually transient (neuropraxia); permanent if transected |
| **Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) injury** | Runs deep to submandibular gland, can be injured in level I-II dissection | Ipsilateral tongue deviation towards the lesion (unopposed contralateral genioglossus), difficulty with speech and swallowing | Usually permanent if transected; speech therapy |
| **Phrenic nerve injury** | Rare; runs on anterior surface of scalenus anterior in the posterior triangle | Ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis → raised hemidiaphragm on CXR, dyspnoea | Usually observed; diaphragmatic plication if symptomatic |
| **Horner's syndrome** | Sympathetic chain injury (runs prevertebral, deep in the neck) | Miosis, ptosis, anhidrosis (ipsilateral) | No treatment; permanent |

> ***Modified radical neck dissection preserves one or more of: IJV, CN XI, SCM. Radical neck dissection removes all. Both have the same recurrence rates but modified radical has much lower morbidity. Radical is only performed when there is evidence of invasion into these structures.*** [4]

#### 2.3 Complications of Parotid Surgery [2]

| Complication | Mechanism | Clinical Features | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Facial nerve injury** | CN VII runs through the parotid gland dividing it into superficial and deep lobes. Despite careful dissection, neuropraxia (temporary) is common; transection (permanent) is rare in benign surgery | Ipsilateral facial weakness (brow, eye closure, mouth — depending on branch injured). Marginal mandibular branch is most vulnerable | If neuropraxia: observation (recovery over weeks-months). If transected: primary repair or cable nerve graft (sural nerve, great auricular nerve). Adjuncts: eye care (lubricant, taping) if unable to close eye |
| ***Frey syndrome (auriculotemporal syndrome / gustatory sweating)*** [2] | ***Aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres between the otic ganglion and salivary tissues → innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels instead of salivary gland*** [2] | ***Sweating and flushing of facial skin over parotid bed and neck during mastication*** [2] | Conservative: antiperspirant. Medical: botulinum toxin injection (blocks cholinergic nerve terminals to sweat glands). Surgical: interpositional barrier (e.g. acellular dermal matrix) between nerve stumps and skin |
| **Great auricular nerve injury** | Great auricular nerve crosses the SCM and provides sensation to the ear lobule; it is the most commonly injured nerve in parotid surgery | Numbness of ear lobule (ipsilateral) | Usually permanent; no treatment |
| **Salivary fistula / sialocele** | Leakage of saliva from cut parotid tissue or duct stump | Swelling that increases at mealtimes, clear fluid drainage from wound | Pressure dressing, repeated aspiration, anticholinergic (glycopyrrolate). Rarely requires re-operation |
| **Tumour recurrence** | Incomplete excision (especially if enucleation was performed instead of formal parotidectomy) | New mass in parotid bed | Revision surgery ± RT; multifocal recurrence after spillage is very difficult to manage |

<Callout title="Frey Syndrome — Why Does Eating Make You Sweat?">
During parotid surgery, the parasympathetic secretomotor fibres to the parotid gland (carried by the auriculotemporal nerve from the otic ganglion) are inevitably cut. During healing, these parasympathetic fibres regenerate but aberrantly — instead of growing back to salivary acini, they grow into the skin and innervate sweat glands and subcutaneous blood vessels. When the patient eats (which normally stimulates parasympathetic salivation), the misdirected fibres instead trigger sweating and flushing over the parotid region. It's a classic example of **aberrant nerve regeneration**. [2]

#### 2.4 Complications of Radiotherapy (H&N Region)

Radiation to the head and neck causes significant acute and late toxicity:

| Timing | Complication | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Acute** | Radiation dermatitis | Direct radiation damage to skin basal layer | Moisturiser, steroid cream if severe |
| | Mucositis (oral/pharyngeal) | Radiation kills rapidly dividing mucosal epithelial cells → ulceration, pain | Analgesics, mouthwashes, PEG feeding if severe |
| | Dysphagia / odynophagia [9] | Mucosal inflammation and oedema | Dietary modification, analgesia, PEG tube |
| | Hoarseness [9] | Laryngeal oedema | Observation, voice rest |
| **Late** | Xerostomia (dry mouth) | Radiation damage to salivary glands (especially parotid — serous acini are very radiosensitive) | Saliva substitutes, pilocarpine (muscarinic agonist to stimulate residual gland), IMRT (intensity-modulated RT) to spare parotid |
| | Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) of mandible | Radiation damages osteocytes and vasculature of mandible → hypovascular, hypocellular, hypoxic bone → cannot heal after minor trauma (e.g. tooth extraction) | Prevention: dental clearance BEFORE RT. Treatment: hyperbaric oxygen, antibiotics, debridement, free flap reconstruction if severe |
| | Radiation-induced fibrosis / trismus | Fibrosis of masticator muscles (masseter, pterygoids) | Jaw physiotherapy (TheraBite device), pentoxifylline + vitamin E |
| | Hypothyroidism | Radiation to thyroid gland | TFT monitoring, thyroxine replacement |
| | Second primary malignancy | Radiation-induced DNA damage in surrounding normal tissue | Long-term surveillance |
| | Dental caries | Xerostomia → loss of saliva's protective buffering and antimicrobial action → rampant caries | Fluoride trays, meticulous dental hygiene |

#### 2.5 Complications of Chemotherapy (H&N Regimens)

Cisplatin is the backbone of H&N chemotherapy (especially for NPC, concurrent chemoRT). Key toxicities:

| Toxicity | Mechanism | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Nephrotoxicity** | Cisplatin is excreted renally and causes direct tubular damage (proximal tubular necrosis) | Aggressive IV hydration pre- and post-infusion, monitor Cr, avoid concomitant nephrotoxins |
| **Ototoxicity** | Damage to cochlear hair cells (outer hair cells most susceptible) → irreversible sensorineural hearing loss (high frequency first) | Audiometric monitoring, dose adjustment |
| **Nausea / vomiting** | Highly emetogenic — triggers chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) | 5-HT₃ antagonist (ondansetron) + NK1 antagonist (aprepitant) + dexamethasone |
| **Myelosuppression** | Direct bone marrow toxicity | FBC monitoring, G-CSF if needed, dose adjustment |
| **Peripheral neuropathy** | Sensory axonal neuropathy from platinum-DNA adducts in dorsal root ganglion neurons | Dose-dependent; gabapentin/pregabalin for symptom management |

#### 2.6 Complications of Congenital Mass Surgery

| Surgery | Specific Complication | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| **Sistrunk procedure** | Recurrence (if incomplete excision of tract or hyoid), hypothyroidism (if normal thyroid not confirmed pre-op), wound infection | Tract extends from cyst through hyoid to foramen cecum — miss any part → recurrence |
| **Branchial cyst excision** | Recurrence, injury to nearby structures (carotid vessels, CN X, CN XII, CN XI for 2nd cleft; facial nerve for 1st cleft) | 2nd cleft tract passes between internal and external carotid arteries and near CN X/XII |
| **Cystic hygroma excision** | Recurrence (infiltrative margins), nerve injury, haemorrhage, incomplete excision | Lymphatic malformation insinuates between normal structures |

---

### 3. Follow-Up and Surveillance

> ***"Recurrence of the pathologies treated, both benign and malignant. LN treated for unknown primary, the patient should be followed up regularly."*** [8]

| Condition | Surveillance Protocol |
|---|---|
| **Differentiated thyroid CA** | ***Neck USG every 6 months; TSH + thyroglobulin every 3 months*** [5]. Post-RAI whole body scan at 1 week (screen for residual) and at 6–12 months (screen for recurrence) [4] |
| **Medullary thyroid CA** | Calcitonin + CEA levels for monitoring; neck USG; CT TAP + bone scan if calcitonin rising [4] |
| **NPC** | ***EBV DNA levels*** for treatment response and recurrence detection; regular nasopharyngoscopy; imaging [4] |
| **Oral/oropharyngeal SCC** | Regular clinic visits with oral examination, flexible nasolaryngoscopy; CT/MRI + PET-CT as indicated |
| **Pleomorphic adenoma** | Long-term follow-up for recurrence (can recur even 10–20 years later) and malignant transformation |
| **Unknown primary (treated)** | ***Regular follow-up*** [8] — the primary may declare itself years later |

---

<Callout title="High Yield Summary">

**Thyroidectomy complications (must know)**:
- **Immediate**: bleeding, thyroid storm, SLN injury (loss of high pitch), RLN injury (unilateral → hoarseness; bilateral partial → airway obstruction; bilateral complete → breathy voice but airway open)
- **Early**: ***Reactionary haemorrhage → open ALL stitches at bedside first!*** Haematoma → venous congestion → laryngeal oedema → asphyxiation
- **Late**: ***Hypoparathyroidism → hypocalcaemia (MOST common complication)*** — perioral numbness, carpopedal spasm, Chvostek's, Trousseau's, laryngospasm. Mx: IV calcium gluconate then oral Ca + calcitriol. Also: hypothyroidism, recurrence, scar.

**Post-thyroidectomy stridor DDx**: haemorrhage, bilateral RLN irritation, hypocalcaemic laryngospasm, tracheal injury/pneumothorax, tracheomalacia.

**Bilateral RLN paradox**: partial bilateral injury → adductor spasm → airway obstruction (6 adductors overpower 2 abductors). Complete bilateral injury → cadaveric position → patent airway but poor voice.

**Parotid surgery**: facial nerve injury (neuropraxia common, transection rare), Frey syndrome (gustatory sweating from aberrant parasympathetic regeneration), great auricular nerve injury (ear lobe numbness).

**Neck dissection**: CN XI injury (shoulder drop), IJV sacrifice (facial oedema), chyle leak (left level IV/Vb), marginal mandibular nerve injury (lip droop).

**Radiotherapy (H&N)**: mucositis, xerostomia, osteoradionecrosis of mandible, dental caries, trismus, hypothyroidism.

**Cisplatin toxicity**: nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression, neuropathy.

      markscheme: "Reactionary haemorrhage causing neck haematoma. Pathophysiology: bleeding within 24h post-op causes haematoma under strap muscles and cervical fascia, compressing venous return leading to laryngeal oedema and complete vocal cord closure causing asphyxiation. Immediate first action: remove ALL stitches from skin down to cervical fascia at the bedside to decompress the haematoma.
