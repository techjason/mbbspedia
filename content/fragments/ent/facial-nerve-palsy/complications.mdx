## Complications of Facial Nerve Palsy

Complications of facial nerve palsy arise from two broad sources: (A) **consequences of the facial weakness itself** — the direct functional losses from having a paralysed face; and (B) **sequelae of aberrant nerve recovery** — what happens when the nerve regenerates improperly. We also cover (C) **complications of the surgical treatments** (especially parotidectomy, the most commonly examined surgical complication set). Understanding each complication from its pathophysiological basis makes them easy to remember and predict.

---

### A. Complications of Facial Weakness Itself

These occur because the facial nerve controls a remarkably wide range of functions — not just smiling. When any of these are lost, specific complications follow.

#### 1. Ocular Complications (The Most Important Preventable Complications)

This is the **number one** clinical concern in any patient with facial palsy, regardless of cause.

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Exposure keratitis** | Orbicularis oculi weakness → **lagophthalmos** (inability to fully close the eye) → cornea is exposed to air, desiccation, and foreign bodies. Additionally, in proximal lesions, loss of greater petrosal nerve → ↓ lacrimation → ↓ tear film → cornea dries out even faster. Finally, the blink reflex (afferent CN V, efferent CN VII) is disrupted on the efferent limb, so the eye cannot blink protectively. | The corneal epithelium relies on the tear film for oxygen, nutrients, and mechanical protection. Without adequate coverage, epithelial cells desiccate and slough → punctate epithelial erosions → frank epithelial defect. |
| **Corneal ulceration** | Untreated exposure keratitis progresses. The denuded corneal stroma is vulnerable to **secondary bacterial infection** (Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus) → infectious corneal ulcer. | Can progress rapidly (hours) to corneal perforation, endophthalmitis, and **permanent visual loss**. This is why ***cornea is at risk due to poor eyelid closure and reduced tearing which may result in drying and abrasions*** [2] and why ***eye protection and eye drops*** [1] are non-negotiable. |
| **Corneal scarring / opacification** | Healed corneal ulcer leaves a scar (leucoma) → permanent visual impairment | Even with treatment, deep ulcers may leave visually significant scars |
| **Epiphora (paradoxical tearing)** | Despite reduced basal lacrimation (in proximal lesions), the exposed cornea triggers **reflex tearing** via CN V afferents → lacrimal gland oversecretion. Combined with lower lid laxity (orbicularis weakness) → tears overflow instead of draining into the punctum. | Patients complain "my eye is always watering" — this is NOT because they have too many tears, but because (a) reflex hypersecretion and (b) the lower lid sags away from the globe (ectropion) so tears don't reach the punctum. |
| **Ectropion** | Orbicularis oculi weakness → loss of tone in the lower lid → the lower lid falls away from the globe → exposure of conjunctiva, improper tear drainage | Contributes to both exposure keratitis (lower cornea exposed) and epiphora (tears miss the punctum) |

<Callout title="Most Important Complication" type="error">
**Corneal damage** is the most important acute complication of facial nerve palsy and the one most likely to cause permanent morbidity. Every patient with HB Grade III or worse must receive explicit eye protection instructions. The management was covered in the previous section: artificial tears (day), lubricating ointment + taping (night), protective glasses, and consideration of **gold weight implantation** or **tarsorrhaphy** for prolonged cases [2].

#### 2. Oral and Nutritional Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Difficulty eating** | Buccinator weakness → food accumulates in the buccal sulcus on the affected side because the buccinator normally pushes food medially back onto the occlusal surface. Orbicularis oris weakness → poor oral seal → difficulty containing food and liquid. |
| **Drooling** | Orbicularis oris weakness → incompetent oral sphincter → saliva dribbles from the affected corner of the mouth. This is NOT because of excess saliva production — it's a mechanical sealing problem. |
| **Biting of the buccal mucosa** | Without buccinator tone, the cheek falls inward between the teeth during chewing → repeated traumatic biting → mucosal ulceration |
| **Aspiration risk** | More relevant in bilateral palsy or when combined with other bulbar cranial neuropathies. The loss of oral competence means liquids may spill posteriorly into the pharynx before the swallow reflex is triggered. |

#### 3. Communication and Psychosocial Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Speech difficulty** | Orbicularis oris and buccinator weakness → difficulty with bilabial consonants (b, p, m, w) and labiodental consonants (f, v). The patient sounds "slushy" or mumbles. Not a dysarthria in the neurological sense (that involves tongue, palate, larynx) but a mechanical articulation problem. |
| **Inability to whistle or blow** | Orbicularis oris cannot form the tight seal needed |
| **Facial disfigurement and psychosocial impact** | The face is the primary vehicle for human social communication. Facial asymmetry → inability to smile, express emotions, or make eye contact comfortably. This leads to **depression, social withdrawal, anxiety, reduced quality of life**. Studies show psychosocial morbidity is often underestimated by treating physicians. |
| **Loss of non-verbal communication** | Facial expressions convey > 50% of emotional information. Loss of ability to smile, frown, or express surprise profoundly affects interpersonal relationships and professional life. |

#### 4. Auditory Complications

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis |
|---|---|
| **Hyperacusis** | Loss of nerve to stapedius → stapedius muscle paralysis → cannot dampen oscillation of the stapes → sounds (especially low-frequency) are perceived as abnormally and painfully loud on the affected side. This is functionally disabling — patients avoid noisy environments. |

---

### B. Complications of Aberrant Nerve Recovery (Sequelae of Regeneration)

These occur when axonal degeneration has happened (HB Grade V–VI initially) and the nerve regenerates, but the regenerating axons grow into the **wrong** Schwann cell tubes, ending up at unintended targets. Think of it as regenerating nerve fibres taking a "wrong turn" at the branching point.

#### 1. Synkinesis

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Involuntary movement of one group of facial muscles when another group is voluntarily activated |
| **Mechanism** | After axonal degeneration, regenerating motor axons from the proximal stump grow down the distal endoneurial tubes. But these tubes branch, and axons that originally innervated orbicularis oculi may instead grow down the tube leading to orbicularis oris (or vice versa). When the patient tries to close their eye, the mouth twitches — because the "eye-closing" axon now innervates mouth muscles. |
| **Common patterns** | Oral-ocular synkinesis: mouth moves when closing eye. Ocular-oral synkinesis: eye narrows when smiling. Platysmal synkinesis: neck tenses during facial expressions. |
| **Incidence** | Occurs in ~15–30% of Bell's palsy patients who had severe initial palsy (especially HB V–VI) |
| **Management** | Botulinum toxin injection to the overactive muscle group (temporarily paralyses the misdirected fibres). Mime therapy and biofeedback physiotherapy. Selective myectomy in severe cases. |

#### 2. Crocodile Tears (Gustatory Lacrimation)

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Tearing from the ipsilateral eye during eating |
| **Mechanism** | During regeneration, parasympathetic secretomotor fibres that originally ran in the **chorda tympani** (destined for the submandibular and sublingual glands → salivation) aberrantly regenerate into the pathway of the **greater petrosal nerve** (destined for the lacrimal gland → tearing). So when the patient eats (triggering a salivatory parasympathetic response), the signal reaches the lacrimal gland instead → tears flow while eating. The name "crocodile tears" comes from the myth that crocodiles weep while eating their prey. |
| **Incidence** | ~6% of recovered Bell's palsy patients |
| **Management** | Botulinum toxin injection into the lacrimal gland, anticholinergic eye drops (e.g. ipratropium). Usually mild and tolerable. |

#### 3. Contracture

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Chronic increased tone and tightness in the facial muscles on the affected side, giving a paradoxical appearance that the affected side looks "smaller" or "tighter" than the normal side |
| **Mechanism** | Aberrant reinnervation leads to co-contraction of multiple muscle groups at rest → chronic tonic contraction → fibrotic shortening of the muscles. The nasolabial fold may actually appear DEEPER on the affected side than the normal side (confusing for the examiner). |
| **Management** | Botulinum toxin to relax contracted muscles. Physiotherapy. |

#### 4. Hemifacial Spasm

| Feature | Explanation |
|---|---|
| **Definition** | Involuntary, intermittent, clonic contractions of muscles innervated by CN VII |
| **Mechanism** | Can occur as a late sequela of Bell's palsy due to aberrant regeneration and ephaptic transmission (cross-talk between adjacent demyelinated nerve fibres — an electrical impulse in one fibre jumps to a neighbouring fibre). Can also be caused by vascular compression of CN VII at the root exit zone (a different entity). |
| **Management** | Botulinum toxin injection (first-line). Microvascular decompression if caused by vascular compression. |

### C. Complications Related to the Underlying Cause

Facial nerve palsy doesn't exist in isolation — it's often a sign of an underlying disease, and that disease can produce its own complications.

| Underlying cause | Specific complications |
|---|---|
| **Cholesteatoma** | ***Extracranial complications: facial nerve paralysis, ossicular chain erosion, labyrinthitis, lateral SCC fistula, subcutaneous/subperiosteal abscess*** [3]. ***Intracranial complications: extradural abscess, subdural abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis, meningitis, brain abscess — temporal lobe and cerebellum, otitic hydrocephalus*** [3]. The cholesteatoma erodes bone relentlessly, and each complication represents erosion into a different critical structure. |
| **Temporal bone fracture** | SNHL (cochlear damage), CSF otorrhoea (dural tear), meningitis (if CSF leak persists > 7 days), haemotympanum, conductive hearing loss (ossicular disruption) |
| **Parotid malignancy** | Local invasion (skin, mandible, EAC), cervical lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis (especially lung for ***adenoid cystic carcinoma — distant metastasis common: lung*** [1]) |
| **CPA tumour** | Progressive hearing loss, trigeminal neuropathy, hydrocephalus (large tumour compresses 4th ventricle), brainstem compression |

---

### D. Complications of Surgical Treatment

#### 1. Parotidectomy Complications

This is explicitly covered in the lecture and is a favourite exam topic [1].

**Early complications** [1]:

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis | Incidence/Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ***Bleeding / haematoma*** [1] | Parotid bed is highly vascular (branches of external carotid artery — transverse facial, superficial temporal). Post-operative haematoma can cause airway compromise if large. | Requires urgent return to theatre for evacuation if expanding. |
| ***Facial nerve palsy*** [1] | The facial nerve runs **through** the parotid gland. During parotidectomy, the nerve must be identified and preserved (unless deliberately sacrificed for malignancy). Injury mechanisms: traction, cautery, inadvertent transection, oedema. | ***Transient ~5%*** [1] — neuropraxia from traction/oedema; recovers in weeks to months. ***Permanent ~1%*** [1] — transection or severe thermal injury; requires nerve grafting (***sural nerve or great auricular nerve grafting*** [1]). |
| ***Wound infection*** [1] | Surgical site contamination, haematoma providing culture medium | Standard surgical wound infection management |
| ***Salivary fistula*** [1] | Residual parotid tissue (in superficial parotidectomy, the deep lobe is preserved) continues to secrete saliva → saliva tracks along the surgical wound and exits through the skin | Usually self-limiting (days to weeks). Management: pressure dressings, anticholinergic drugs (to reduce salivary secretion). Persistent fistula may require revision surgery or botulinum toxin injection. |

**Late complications** [1]:

| Complication | Pathophysiological Basis | Details |
|---|---|---|
| ***Recurrence*** [1] | Incomplete excision, especially for pleomorphic adenoma (which has pseudopods extending beyond the visible capsule — this is why ***avoid enucleation and tumour spillage*** [1]) | ***Consider radiotherapy for recurrent tumour or prevention of recurrence in case of spillage*** [1] |
| ***Frey's syndrome — gustatory sweating*** [1][2] | ***Characterised by sweating and flushing of facial skin over parotid bed and neck during mastication*** [2]. ***Result of aberrant regeneration of cut parasympathetic fibres between the otic ganglion and salivary tissues which leads to innervation of sweat glands and subcutaneous vessels*** [2]. During parotidectomy, the auriculotemporal nerve (carrying parasympathetic fibres from otic ganglion to parotid) is inevitably severed. On regeneration, these parasympathetic fibres grow into the cut sympathetic fibres that innervate cutaneous sweat glands and blood vessels. When the patient eats → parasympathetic discharge → sweat glands activated and vessels dilate → sweating and flushing over the parotid bed. | Affects ~30–50% of patients. Diagnosed with **Minor's starch-iodine test** (paint iodine on the cheek, dust with starch, give patient something to eat → sweating areas turn blue-black). Treatment: topical glycopyrrolate cream, botulinum toxin injection into the affected skin (blocks cholinergic transmission to sweat glands). |
| ***Hypertrophic scar / keloid*** [1] | Abnormal wound healing with excessive collagen deposition | Pre-auricular incision is standard — usually heals well cosmetically, but keloid-prone individuals may develop hypertrophic scars |
| ***Sunken parotid area, cosmetic problem*** [1] | Removal of the parotid gland leaves a concavity in the pre-auricular region → facial asymmetry | Can be addressed with fat grafting, dermal fat graft, or acellular dermal matrix to fill the defect |
| **Ear lobe numbness** | The great auricular nerve (C2, C3) crosses the sternocleidomastoid and is often sacrificed or injured during parotidectomy → loss of sensation over the ear lobe and angle of mandible | Very common (almost universal); most patients adapt over time |

<Callout title="Frey Syndrome — Exam Favourite" type="idea">
Frey syndrome is one of those topics that sounds exotic but is very commonly examined because it tests understanding of autonomic nerve regeneration. The key concept: **parasympathetic fibres meant for salivary glands aberrantly reinnervate sympathetic targets (sweat glands, blood vessels)**. So eating (a parasympathetic stimulus) causes sweating and flushing (normally sympathetic responses). The diagnostic test is Minor's starch-iodine test. Treatment is botulinum toxin injection.

#### 2. Complications of Mastoidectomy (for Cholesteatoma)

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Facial nerve injury** | The nerve runs in the posterior wall of the middle ear (mastoid segment) — at risk during drilling |
| **Sensorineural hearing loss** | Inadvertent damage to the inner ear (especially lateral semicircular canal) during surgery |
| **CSF leak** | Inadvertent breach of the tegmen tympani (roof of the middle ear) → communication with the middle cranial fossa |
| **Meningitis** | Secondary to CSF leak |
| **Recurrent / residual cholesteatoma** | Incomplete removal → requires revision surgery. This is why long-term follow-up with MRI DWI is needed. |

#### 3. Complications of Facial Nerve Decompression

| Complication | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **SNHL** | Transmastoid or middle cranial fossa approach risks damage to the inner ear |
| **CSF leak** | Middle cranial fossa approach involves retraction of the temporal lobe dura → potential dural tear |
| **Failure to recover** | If decompression is performed too late (> 14 days [2]) or if the degree of neural injury was too severe (neurotmesis — complete nerve disruption) |
| **Worsened facial palsy** | Surgical manipulation of an already oedematous nerve can occasionally worsen neuropraxia |

---

### E. Timeline of Complications

| Timing | Complication |
|---|---|
| **Acute (first days)** | Exposure keratitis (if eye care not instituted), aspiration (bilateral/severe palsy), speech difficulty |
| **Subacute (weeks)** | Corneal ulceration (if exposure keratitis untreated), psychological impact, weight loss from eating difficulty |
| **Chronic (months)** | Synkinesis, crocodile tears, contracture, hemifacial spasm (all from aberrant regeneration). Permanent corneal scarring. |
| **Long-term (years)** | Persistent disfigurement → psychosocial morbidity. Complications of underlying disease (recurrent cholesteatoma, tumour recurrence/metastasis). |

<Callout title="High Yield Summary — Complications of Facial Nerve Palsy">

1. **Corneal damage** (exposure keratitis → ulceration → scarring → blindness) is the most important preventable acute complication. All patients with incomplete eye closure need aggressive eye protection.
2. **Synkinesis** (~15–30% of severe Bell's palsy) results from aberrant axonal regeneration — motor axons grow into wrong Schwann cell tubes. Managed with botulinum toxin and physiotherapy.
3. **Crocodile tears** (gustatory lacrimation) — parasympathetic fibres meant for salivary glands aberrantly reinnervate the lacrimal gland. Patient tears while eating.
4. **Frey syndrome** (after parotidectomy) — parasympathetic fibres meant for the parotid gland aberrantly reinnervate sweat glands and cutaneous vessels. Patient sweats and flushes over the cheek while eating. Diagnosed by Minor's starch-iodine test. Treated with botulinum toxin.
5. **Parotidectomy complications**: early — bleeding/haematoma, facial nerve palsy (transient ~5%, permanent ~1%), wound infection, salivary fistula. Late — recurrence, Frey syndrome, hypertrophic scar, sunken parotid area.
6. **Cholesteatoma complications** (the cause of the facial palsy): extracranial (ossicular erosion, labyrinthitis, LSCC fistula, subperiosteal abscess) and intracranial (extradural/subdural abscess, meningitis, brain abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis, otitic hydrocephalus).
7. **Psychosocial impact** is profound and often underestimated — the face is our primary tool of social communication.
